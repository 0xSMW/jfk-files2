CONTACT REPORT #
25 January 1963.

TIME/PLACE : Safe House #2, 1000-Jan 25,
PRESENT : Tulpa, Tipteft, Lavion,

1. Purpose of this meeting was to inform Kulpa that
Headquarters had agreed to his trip to the Congo and to begin certain
instructions to Meinturff. L. said that he had not so yet received
instructions from Holden and that the latter planned to be in town on
Saturday. He would send the airline ticket from that city. L. also stated
that Serge Michel had agreed that the first six covers on the new triques
Revolutionaire (1) would be shot by K. K. his lip for a light meter
since he said that his present one was broken and since he had to take
pictures prior to his departure for the Congo which he anticipated would be
either early or mid next week.

2. Another twist was that he had been contacted by Gibson,
who informed him that a certain Dave Matty who runs a highly suspect sheet in
New York City had written to Gibson asking him for photos; Gibson will
purchase and forward several of K.'s negatives. Since all this is weird
though, Kulpa promised to get more facts.

3. The rest of the meeting was taken up by Tipteft
straightening out his accountings.
