Dear Mr. Moore:
 As you bring to a close your active
career of service to your country, I want
to join your friends and co-workers in
wishing you well and hoping that you find
your retirement filled with enjoyment and
satisfaction.
 It takes the conscientious efforts of
many people to do the important work of
this Agency. You leave with the knowledge
that you have personally contributed to our
success in carrying out our mission. Your
faithful and loyal support has measured up
to the high ideals and traditions of the
Federal service.
 May I express to you my appreciation and
extend my best wishes for the years ahead.
 Yours sincerely,
