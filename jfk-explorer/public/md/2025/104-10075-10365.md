REF DIR 8399

1. BELIEVE IT CURRENTLY APPROPRIATE REVIEW AMFAUNA-25 SITUATION
WITHIN FRAMEWORK THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE REF
FORWARDED. SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS ARE:

A. WAVE ACTION RESULTED EXFILTRATION AMFAUNA-14 AND
THUS DIRECT THREAT SECURITY AMFAUNA-35, AMFAUNA-39. BERNARDO

DEBRIEFING ABFAUNA-14 REVEALS THESE AGENTS NOT KNOWN DSE. WILL
ATTEMPT CONFIRM THIS INITIAL DEBRIEFING CONCLUSION VIA FLUTTER
EXAM. IT APPEARS HOWEVER THAT OUR REMEDIAL ACTION HAS NOT
ONLY AVERTED POSSIBLE FLAP BUT HAS KEPT VIABLE ASSETS IN PLACE.

B. WAVE ATTEMPTS EXFIL ANCUTLER-2 WERE NOT PRODUCTIVE
BECAUSE ARGUTLER-2 REFUSED LEAVE CUBA WHEN WE OFFERED HE. THIS
OPPORTUNITY. THIS DUE FACT HER MOTHER SERIOUSLY ILL.

DEVELOPMENTS WITH STOICISM BUT IT IS TIME INFLUENCE DEVELOP-
MENTS VIA SOUND ACTION. THUS DESPITE ANCUTLER-2 INFITIAL
REFUSAL LEAVE CUBA PROPOSE CONTINUE ATTERPIS EXFIL

ALTHOUGH THIS PROBLEM CURRENTLY CONPLICATED BY FACT VS HAVE
NO DIRECT CONTACT WITH ANCUTLER-2 AND DO NOT KNOW WHERE SHE

NORMAL CORTO CHANNELS. WAVE TRYING IDENTIFY A-2 HIDING PLACE
IN ORDER BARE ANOTHER ATTEMPT EXFIL HER BUT THIS TI
CONSUMING FRUSTRATING EFFORT WHICH HOLDS NO TOMEDIATE PROSPECT
OF SUCCESS. SUGGEST THEREFORE FATE OTHER ANFAUNA ASSETS CANNOT
BE ALLOWED DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS SINGLE EFFORT. HAVE THEREFORE
REVIEVED EACH ANFAUNA ASSET WHO WOULD BE COMPROMISED BY ARREST
ANCUTLER-2 AND HAVE CONSIDERED HOW WE COULD ATTEMPT SAVE
