E. HOWARD HUNT, JR., being duly sworn, deposes and
says:

1. On January 10, 1976, I was examined by Frederick D.
Baron, a counsel for the Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities.
On January 11, 1976, I was examined by both Mr. Baron and Howard
Liebengood, another counsel for the Senate Select Committee. At
both of these examinations I was accompanied by my counsel, Randall C.
Coleman, and advised of my Constitutional rights.

2. I have read the transcripts of both of the above-
mentioned examinations, and I hereby affirm that my testimony
therein is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

E. Howard Hunt, Jr.

Sworn to before me this sixth
day of February, 1976.

1 might have directed me to this particular unit.
2
10 3 I was told that somewhere within the overall political
and psychological staff there was located a man with a small
4 office. This man's name was Pash, Colonel Boris Pash, and
5 my understanding was that Colonel Pash had been doing business,
6 let us say, with the Agency in West Germany for quite a while.
7 I sought out Colonel Pash. I was directed to his office
8 and found sitting with him another Agency officer named Artie
9 Lazarus I'm not sure whether it is Arthur, Lazarus.
Mr. Baron. It's a Greek name. Aristides is his correct
10
11 first name, but he goes by Atilo.
12 Mr. Hunt. Very good. But in any case, he was known
13 throughout my career as stie Lazarus. And I was at that
14 point on, let's say, a search mission to determine whether the
15 alleged capability of Colonel Pash in wet affairs, which is
16 how it was referred to, that is liquidations, would have any
17 relevance to our particular problem of the Albanian dis-
18 appointments.
Mr. Baron. By liquidations, you mean assassinations?
19
Mr. Hunt. Assassinations. Assassinations, kidnappings,
20
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003 21 removals, let's say.
This had been alleged to me. So I spoke to Colonel Pash
22
23 in Mr.Lazaruses presence. I explained the problem to him,
24 although at that juncture I'm quite sure that we had not
25 identified the Albanian suspect. So we were talking hypothetically

NW 50955 DocId: 32202418 Page 4 TOP SECRET

1 earlier, that when I first inquired around for the location of
2 Colonel Pash and his assistant, the reaction I encountered
11
3 was a rather jesting one, and the impression I gained was
4 here were a couple of men who were drawing salaries and doing
5 very little.
6 And so when Colonel Pash seemed reluctant to become
7 involved in responding affirmatively to my questions, my
8 inference was that Colonel Pash and Lazarus could well not
9 have such a capability but for purposes of employment and
10 status, this was the job they had. But they didn't want
11 anyone to call upon them to activate their particular
12 abilities.
13 Now that was my impression, and I was a little disgusted
14 by it. I think I talked to the Chief of the PP staff later,
15 who was of course well aware of the Albanian problem and I
16 said I didn't get any satisfaction from Pash, but it doesn't
17 really make any difference because we don't have the name
18 of the suspected individual.
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
19 Mr. Baron. Just to stop here for a second and clear up
20 some of these details, were you under the impression that what
21 you called wet affairs, assassinations, kidnappings, or other
22 removals from the scene of troublesome individuals was the
23 primary function of this unit that Pash and Lazarus were
24 running?
25 Mr. Hunt. Yes. In fact the only. As far as I knew, they

NW 50955 DocId: 32202418 Page 5 TOP SECRET

WARD & PAUL gsh 12
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000 TOP SECRET 12

1 had no other function. If they had another function, I was
2 never made aware of what it was.
15 3 Do you know anything about Colonel Pash's background?
4 Mr. Baron. I know a bit, but if you think that there are
5 relevant details to put on the background, go ahead.
6 Mr. Hunt. Well, I had not thought of Colonel Pash for
7 years until I began reading a book called "Lawrence and Oppen-
8 heimer," and I saw quite a few references to Colonel Pash. I
9 had known previously that he had been associated during the
10 war with the Manhattan Project and that he had a security
background. And as I believe I touched on briefly before, it
11
12 was my impression that Pash had been active a couple of years
13 at least before I knew him in West Germany with the sort of
14 thing that we had been discussing so far today.
15 Mr. Baron. What kinds of stories had you heard about
16 Pash's previous activities?
17 Mr. Hunt. Kidnappings mostly.
18 Mr. Baron. And where were those?
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003 19 Mr. Hunt. West Germany and West Berlin.
Mr. Baron. Do you know the names of any of the victims
20
21 of the kidnapping or any of the people involved other than
22 Pash and Lazarus?
23 Mr. Hunt. I do not.
Mr. Baron. And are you aware from whatever source of
24
any assassination planning or attempts that Pash was involved

2 Mr. Hunt. I am not.
5 3 Mr. Baron. Does your answer include not only the period
4 of time before you talked with Colonel Pash but after you
talked with Colonel Pash?
5
6 Mr. Hunt. Yes, sir.
7 I might add that I was rather briefly at CIA headquarters
8 at that time and within a very short period of time after I
9 had had my interview with Colonel Pash, I was transferred to the
10 Guatemala project, the overthrow of Guatemala.
11 WARD & PAUL
12 Mr. Baron. Is that the reason why you did not follow up
on the problem with this particular suspected double agent
after not receiving satisfaction from Colonel Pash?
13
14 Mr. Hunt. That certainly could have been one reason.
On the other hand, I was chief of, I can see I'm really going
15
16 to have to get into a lot more here. This is going to be.
17 dry and dull stuff for you.
The late King Zog was avelient of mine sin the sense that
18
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003 19 we had brought him to a safe, area. We were keeping him housed.
20 in Egypt. I had made a trip at one time over to Egypt to
21 try to intercede indirectly with Colonel Nasser for King Zog
22 who was very upset about the disappearance and loss of all
23 of his partisans in the operations that the Agency was conducting.
24 And he was my concern much less the the counter-
25 intelligence or espionage aspect, which is not my function, but

1 I had a client-King to worry about. And also, we were trying
2 to bring Zog into this country. So I became interested as
3 a matter of King Zog's disaffection in what was happening tor
4 his rotainers Why were they being parachuted to their
5 deaths in Albania? And that was my introduction to the whole
6 scene in West Germany, where the balance of his retainers were
7 being held by the CIA. Well, not being held, but where they
8 were being housed and trained for Albanian operations.
9 Mr. Baron. Can you explain the term "retainer"?
10 Mr. Hunt. Well, I understood that when he finally got
11 out of Albania, that he brought with him what I can best
12 describe as retainers. That is bodyguards, members of his
13 personal staff, probably some relatives. I think he had
14 four or five sisters with him. But the able-bodied portion
15 of those loyalists who came out with him we had largely taken
16 over thanks to Zog, who, in offect, ordered them to cooperate
17 with us. And then he never saw them again. He naturally
became apprehensive.
18
19 So that was my interest in what was happening to the
20 Albanians that we parachuted in through King Zog. I had no
21 functional counter-espionage interest in the affair. This
! ٢٠
22 would have been handled and this was handled by the Chief
23 of Counter-espionage for the Division.
24 Mr. Baron. Who would that have been at the time?
Mr. Hunt. I can't remember at this point.

1 Mr. Baron. But that would be the person primarily
2 responsible for taking care of this double agent problem?
3
5 4 Mr. Hunt. That's correct.
Mr. Baron. Are you aware of what happened with that
5 suspected double agent?
6 Mr. Hunt. I have no idea because, as I may have indicated
7 previously off the record, it became apparent some years later
8 that the unfortunate fate of our Albanian agents was linked
9 far more closely to the revelations of Kim Philby, the
10 Soviet agent who was in direct liaison with us in Washington
11 and in Great Britain, rather than any penetration, although
12 the possibility of a penetration was of course always there.
13 But I don't think that anybody was ever focused.
: 1
14 Again, I left for Latin American affairs. I left the
15 Division about that time and I really never heard about it
16 again. Dong Blaufarb, the Albanian chief, departed for
17 Southeast Asia, and the whole sort of complex of knowledgeable
18 people was broken up through normal transfers and special
19 activities like the Guatemala project.
20 Mr. Baron. Was Doug Blaufarb, knowledeable about your
21 approach to Colonel Pash?
22 Mr. Hunt. Very likely he was, yes. I don't think I
23 would have discussed anything with Colonel Pash about the
matter without talking to Doug about it.
24 Mr. Baron. Who else would have known that you approached

3 1 Colonel Pash with the idea in mind of seeing if an assassination
2 or a kidnapping couldn't be arranged?
4 Mr. Hunt. The then Chief of Foreign Intelligence and
Counter-Intelligence for the Division. And I think now that that
5
6 was Charley English, Charles English. I think he wore both
hats. He had both foreign intelligence responsibility and
7 the counter-intelligence responsibility. And I might have told
8 the division chief about it, although it was not, it had not
9 achieved such stature at that point that I would have
10 necessarily talked to the Division Chief, who I believe at
11 that time was John Richardson of later Vietnam fame.
12
13 It's also possible that the Division Chief in that era
was John Baker, now deceased, who left that division to
14 become Chief of the PP staff, and that would have been a
15 normal follow through for me if I had discussed it with John
16 Baker, my direct Chief, and then to have discussed it with
17 him when he was my staff chief in the overall political and
18 psychological staff.
19 Mr. Baron. Anyone else who would have known about your
20 approach to Colonel Pash or about --
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
21 Mr. Hunt. Or his function.
22 Mr. Baron. Yes, that Colonel Pash was considered to have
23 assassinations as one of his functions.
24 Mr. Hunt. We had a Colonel Buffington who at that time
25 was a member of the PP staff, the overall PP staff, and I think
NW 50955 DocId: 32202418 Page 10 TOP SECRET

WARD & PAUL

1 that he would have been knowledgeable about it.
2
3 Mr. Baron. Was that Milton Buffington?
Mr. Hunt. Yes. I think he later went on and had a career
4
in the Office of Security. Milton Buffington, yes.
5
Mr. Baron. Anyone else?
6
7 Mr. Hunt. Yes, I have the names of three men who unfor-
8 tunately are dead. I could give those names, though. Mr. C.
9 Tracy Barnes, Mr. John Baker, who I've already mentioned, and Mr
10 Lewis W. Thompson. These men were all at one time or another
chiefs of the Agency's PP staff.
11
12 Another man now living to the best of my knowledge who
might well have had knowledge of Pash's function was the

1 name was Gates Lloyd. He later became the Deputy Director for
2 Support of the Agency.
3
4 There's a man named Harold Burris Meyer who was in the
Psychological Warfare Branch of the PP staff. I believe at
5 that time there was an International Organizations Branch
6 which later became the International Organizations Division,
7 then headed by Cord Myer, Jr., and his Deputy at that time was
8 Tom Braden, the now-columnist whose wife has just ascended to
9 the Executive Office Building. There were members of the
10 Labor Branch, and I'm trying to think of that branch of office
that was down the hall.
11
12 There was a labor branch. The people in there might know.
13 There was a lady lawyer named Carol somebody who was very
14 knowledgeable about what was going on in that area.
15 Mr. Baron. Knowledeable about Pash's activities?
16 Mr. Hunt. Well, in the sense that when you have an
17 adjoining office, you usually pretty much know what the other
18 fellow is doing. Just in that sense, because her function
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003 19 in the labor branch had nothing to do with Pash, to my
20 knowledge.
21 What I'm trying to do here is to give you sort of a
22 congeries of people alive and dead who would have had contact
23 knowledge, at the very least, of what Pash's function was.
24 Mr. Baron. Were each of these units referred to as
25 PB with a number following it?

1 Operations and OPC, the staff structure emerged as follows:
2
3 Reporting to the Deputy Director for Plans, i.e. Frank
Wisner, whose Chief of Operations then was Richard Helms, this
4 is the Clandestine Services Organization. There was our
5 support staff, the PP staff, the Foreign Intelligence staff,
6 the Counter-Intelligence, Counter-Espionage staff, and of
7 course the famous staff "D".
8 Also reporting to the Deputy Director for Plans were all
9 of the geographical divisions, such as Western Europe, Southeast
10 Europe, Asia, Near East, and so forth.
11
12 Mr. Baron. Now at this point Frank Wisner was DDP,
Richard Helms was his deputy.
13 Mr. Hunt. Richard Helms was his Chief of Operations.
14 Mr. Baron. All right. The Chief of the PP staff was
15 Mr. Hunt. Either Tracy Barnes or John Baker or Louis.
16 Thompson. E
17 Mr. Baron. And you were located on the South European
18 Mr. Hunt. Southern Europe Division.
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003 19 Mr. Baron. Who headed that division at that point?
20 Mr. Hunt. Either John Baker or John Richardson.
21 So as you see, I had a line responsibility to the Chief
22 of the Southeast Europe Division, as indicated in Exhibit 3.
23 At the same time I had a functional responsibility to the
24 Chief of the PP staff, who was Mr. Barnes or Mr. Baker or
25 Mr. Thompson, just as the Chief of FI for the Southeast Europe

1 Mr. Hunt. Does this satisfy your request?
2 Mr. Baron. It does, indeed.
5 3 Of all of the individuals that you have just mentioned,
4 which ones do you know to your own certainty were clearly
knowledgeable of Boris Pash's activities?
5
6 Mr. Hunt. Artie Lazaruss would be the first one, and
7 after that I can only speculate. I would have to assume that
8 Doug Blaufarb acquired knowledge of it, but perhaps he acquired
9 knowledge through me. I'm not sure. I have made a list of
10 other people whom I have not mentioned who conceivably, by
11 virtue of personal contact or functional responsibility, might
12 well have been aware of Pash's true functional responsibility
13 within the Agency.
14 Mr. Baron. Before I ask you to tick off that list, let's
15 make it clear that all of the names, in addition to Artie
16 Lazanis, are names that you have given as people who are
17 likely to have been knowledgeable of Pash's activities because
18 of their place in the organization structure at that time.
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
19 Mr. Hunt. That's correct, or as I have indicated in some
20 cases, as with the PP labor branch by virtue of physical
21 proximity to that office.
22 Mr. Baron. Okay. Why don't you now just run very briefly
23 through the names of other people who you think could conceivably
24 have been knowledgeable of Pash's function?
25 Mr. Hunt. In some cases I'm going to have to give you their
NW 50955 DocId:32202418 Page 14 TOP SECRET

WARD & PAUL gsh 22
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000 TOP SECRET 22

1 title designation rather than the name of the individual because
2 so much time has passed, I have simply forgotten who it was
5 3 in that particular era.
4 Peter Sichel, who at that time was a member of the German
5 branch of the Western Europe Division, he has since retired
6 and is running his family's wine business in New York. Certainly
7 the then Chief of Western Europe Division, of which Germany
8 was a functional part and the Chief of Operations of Western
9 Europe should know.
10 I would think that Jim Angleton, who would have had
11 direct knowledge and always was the Chief of the CI/CE staff.
12 The Chief of base in Berlin, if in fact Pash conducted any
13 activities in that area, certainly the Chief of base in
Berlin would have been knowledgeable about it.
14
15 Also, the Chief of base at Pollack, which was where we
16 had the celen Operation going on. I don't know whether
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003 17 Bill Harvy, that is William Harvy, at that time was Chief of
18 Operations for Berlin for whether he was simply running the
19 tunnel, but Harvy might well have some knowledge of Pash.
20 I would certainly assume that when we're talking about
21 liquidations and that sort of thing that the Agency's overall
22 Office of Security somewhere within it must have been involved,
23 such German Division personnel as might be available today,
24 West German, and I would also suggest that General Cushman might
25 be knowledgeable for this reason.

i - 1, b. B It was about that time that General Cushman was still
2 assigned to the CIA. I could be wrong about that but I seem
: 15 3 to have a memory of Cushman being around in those days. He
4 was then a Colonel. I had associated with him. In fact, we
5 had shared an office at one time, but that was several years
6 earlier. I would place it about early 1949. But I'm quite
7 sure that Cushman was around in that period of time and
8 involved with the PP staff, though what his function was I
9 don't know.
10 Now there are alive two close friends of mine who were
11 then members of the PP staff, Joseph Bryan ichitand Pinis Part.
These are men who in effect established the PP staff for
12
13 Frank Wisner and then left to go on to other things. They
are both well known writers.
14 Mr. Baron. Let me just return to one name that you
15 mentioned and that is William Harvey.
16 Did you first, generally, what was the nature of your
17 operational relationships to William Harvey after this period?
18 Did you have any?
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
19 Mr. Hunt. I never had any, no. In fact, I've only seen
20 him once in my life, to the best of my recollection.
21 Mr. Baron. As you may know, William Harvey was tasked
22 in 1961 with setting up an executive action capability at
23 the CIA, tasked originally by Richard Bissell to carry out
24 assassinations if required.

5 1 because we're going to slop over into this other matter that
2 Mr. Liebengood wants to talk about tomorrow.
5 3 Mr. Baron. Well, why don't we hold off then, except
4 that for this one question, which is are you aware of any
5 involvement that Dr. Gunn had in assassination planning?
6 Mr. Hunt. No, I'm not because I'm just not familiar
7 with assassination planning. And specifically, for that
8 reason, I'm not aware of any involvement that Dr. Gunn might
9 have had.
10 Mr. Baron. Let's return now to the point of departure,
11 WARD & PAUL which was your conversation with Colonel Pash and the events
12 that led up to it.
13 Who were your supervisors that gave you the impression
14 that Colonel Pash was prepared to carry out assassinations?
15 Mr. Hunt. I wish I could give you a distinct name. I
16 think I covered that in an impressionistic way by saying that
17 Tracy Barnes and John Baker, who were at different times
18 sequentially chiefs of the PP staff, it seems to me that Barnes
19 was probably the one who indicated that Pash had such a
20 capability.
21 I know that I did not get it from Blaufar and I'm
22 quite sure that my information did not come from within the
23 Southeast Europe Division. It must have come accordingly
from the Political and Psychological staff, the contacts there,
24
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
25 and I would have to say Tracy Barnes or John Baker are the

1 most likely.
2 Mr. Baron. And neither of those two men are alive today?
5 3 Mr. Hunt. That's right.
4 Mr. Baron. Did whoever gave you the information about
5 Boris Pash indicate to you that there were any other units
6 in the CIA that could take care of such problems by means of
7 assassination?
8 Mr. Hunt. No. My distinct impression and recollection is
9 the function, if indeed it existed, and I believed it then
10 to have existed as I do today, was centralized or focused in
11 Colonel Pash and tile Lazarus.
WARD & PAUL
12 Mr. Baron. Now what would have been the formal title
13 of the unit that Colonel Pash and Artie Lazarus were running?
14 Mr. Hunt. If it had one, I never knew it.
15 Mr. Baron. Can you add any other detail to the record
16 on your talk with Colonel Pash and his reaction to your
17 request that he consider on a general level the planning of
18 an assassination of a suspected double agent?
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
19 Mr. Hunt. Well, as I recall it, my conversation with him
20 was a relatively brief one. I stepped in the door, met him,
21 saw Aable Lazarus, who I knew briefly, or at least knew him
22 by sight, and I sat down and I said, we have this problem in
23 the Albanian branch. We may need somebody liquidated in
24 Western Germany. Can you handle it if that day comes, or if
25 it comes to that?

1 And he seemed a little startled. I have already indicated
2 that. What I'm trying to do now is to refine my thoughts more
5 3 than I did previously when we were taking sort of a wide
4 swipe at the canvas.
5 Colonel Pash indicated or said to me that it was a matter
6 that would have to be approved by higher authority and as
7 a relatively low ranking officer in those days, I thought he
8 was probably referring to Frank Wisner. And indeed, he may
9 have. It never got pushed up to Frank Wisner's level because
10 there no direct approach or a request for such approval
11 was ever made.
I left with the impression that Colonel Pash was glad
12
13 that he wasn't going to have any business for me or that he
14 had successfully deflected whatever approach I might be making
15 to him because it would give him and Artle Lazarus an
16 opportunity to drink more coffee and to draw their salaries
17 from the Agency while affecting to do a job that they were
18 perhaps not equipped to do.
19 Now again, that impression I had when I left him was at
20 variance with what I had heard before I came in, where I heard
21 he and Astle or he at least had been active in West Germany
22 in wet affairs, particularly kidnappings and that sort of
23 thing.
24 Mr. Baron. And you carried into his office the impression
25 that Colonel Pash was a man who could carry off an assassination

1 Mr. Hunt. No.
2 Mr. Baron. Did you ever discuss this matter with anyone
5 3 other than Colonel Pash?
4 Mr. Hunt. In that context?
5 Mr. Baron. In the context of assassinations or kidnapping.
6 Mr. Hunt. Well, I wasn't involved in plotting or planning
7 any kidnappings. Again, I would suggest that I might very
8 well have gone back to Blaufarb, who was the most interested
9 individual, because he was responsible at the branch level
10 for King Zog as an operational tool, whereas, I had an overall
11 political responsibility for King 20g. And I have described
12 the background of that, the rubric under which I became
13 interested in the Albanian problem in the first place, and
14 then having talked to Pash, it would have been only natural
15 for me to have said to Blanfarb look, I've talked with Pash
16 and he says it will have to be approved by higher authority.
17 Now have you gotten, we don't have a body yet, but when you
18 get a name to put on the target, at that point you will have to
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
19 carry the ball and take it on up the line.
20 Mr. Baron. And you never heard anything further about it?
21 Mr. Hunt. No, probably because I went within, I think,
22 a comparatively few weeks off to the Guatemala operation.
23 Mr. Baron. Did anyone ever mention it to you, say did
24 Artie Lazarus ever mention it to you again?
25 Mr. Hunt. No. I next sawvattenuazarus in Taipei in

End 18, b. 2A 1 it would be about '57 or '58, and I had dinner in his home in
3 Taipei, and I'm quite sure I said at that time, whatever
happened to Boris Pash, or what do you hear from Boris?
