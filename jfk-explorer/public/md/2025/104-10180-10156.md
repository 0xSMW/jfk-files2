PRESENT POSITION AND DUTIES:
08
Since April 1954 I have been working as Assistant District
Manager of the Havana District Sales Office for the above
described companies. In this capacity I have been directly
responsible for all business operations of these companies
throughout the territory of Cuba. It has been my duty to
promote the sale in Cuba of all items manufactured by said
companies; organizing representation in the main cities; appoint
distributors; assist in collection of accounts when necessary;
direct the servicing of their products in case of operating
difficulties; supervise the handling of all of their export-
import shipments; study the market conditions and trends,
analyze competitive situations and advise the factories accord-
ingly; cooperate with and advise local distributors in their
sales promotion programs and assist with important accounts and
contracts; to counsel Management in sales policy and procedures
in this territory; and to protect in every way possible the
interests in Cuba of the above mentioned American manufacturers.

RESUME:
Due to the economic and political situation prevailing in Cuba,
and present restrictions on imported goods, I am considering the
advisability of making a change whereby I can improve my present
standing and future potentialities in accordance with my educa-
tional qualifications and proven experiences. I am only inter-
ested in working direct for an American Company, either at home
or abroad, with a starting base salary of about $12,000 a year.
