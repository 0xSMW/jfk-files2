Oral History Interview
with
EDWARD E.
G. Lansdale

July 11, 1970
Alexandria, Virginia
By Dennis J. O'Brien
For the John F. Kennedy Library

O'BRIEN: I think a logical place to begin in anything
like this is just simply with the question,
when did you first meet President Kennedy,
or Senator Kennedy, if you met him before
he was President?

LANSDALE: I don't recall meeting him before he was
President. The first meeting I believe,
was/ I believe,
the first Saturday following the inauguration,
whatever date that was. I was called into a
meeting in the White House by [Robert S.]
McNamara. It was a meeting, on, actually, on
a report that I had written for [Dwight D.]
Eisenhower. It was sort of a, I'm not sure

-2-

that it was, NSC [National Security Council]
meeting, but it was comparable to that with
the personnel that were attending. There were
several Secretaries: Defense, State, and his
National Security people were there.

O'Brien: Could you discuss that with McNamara and [Roswell L.]
Gilpatric, members of the incoming administra-
tion, before they actually assumed office?

LANSDALE: Just before, that is, a day or so before. I'd
been in Vietnam for a brief visit and got back
just before the inaugural, maybe two or three
days, and at that time both McNamara and
Gilpatric were in Defense getting briefed for
their new jobs. I met them at that time.
The outgoing Deputy Secretary of Defense asked
me to start working with Gilpatric, and so I

[James H]
O'BRIEN: This is Douglas.

LANSDALE: Douglas, Jim Douglas (James H Douglas)

O'BRIEN: How is Douglas to work with, while you're with
him? Is he a pretty sympathetic person?

LANSDALE: Yes, very much so, very much so. He was the
one, actually, who wrote the orders and back-

stopped my visit to Vietnam, and back-
stopped it principally so that I could take
a look at some of the political factors as
well as economic, military, and psychological
and everything else. This, frankly, took a
considerable

standing on his part
that because my views weren't always
popular in other parts of the government.
I gathered that there was some opposition to
my going out, and he insisted on it..

O'BRIEN: I'd like to come back to that. I wonder if
we could go on to talk about one of the major
problems, which is Cuba. When is the first
time that you hear about the Bay of Pigs
invasion, not the Bay of Pigs, but the plans?

LANSDALE: Sometime in the fall of sixty. I think that
I heard of it about the first time that it

was brought up to the inter-policy group of
the Eisenhower administration. I was the
Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense,
at the time, for Special Operations and used
to accompany the Deputy Secretary, who was a
member of the inter-policy group, to most of

the meetings that they had. When Allen Dulles
(Allen-W.-Dulles) first raised the notion to
this inner
the Senate group. I was present at the meeting
as an Assistant.

O'BRIEN: What is the thinking about it at that time?
What kind of operation is -- it
:basically a guerilla operation at this point?

LANSDALE: Initially, it was. Initially, it was very differ-
from
ent than the way it turned out. It was based
(Field)
on a premise that many people in Cuba were very
unhappy with the Castro administration and the
way it was turning away from the initial
revolutionary objectives and the capture of the
revolutionary movement by the Communist Party,
which surprised many of the supporters of
Castro as a guerilla and as a revolutionary

in Cuba, and to cause some overturn at the time.

there was a planning group and CIA (Central

initial plan who started thinking in military

doing that because some of the Cuban military

LANSDALE: OBRIEN:

the group.

LANSDALE: He was one of a planning group who were
planning the operation, but he wasn't a chief,
and I can't recall the guy's name offhand.

LANSDALE: Yes, but initially it was all CIA. They

borrowed some military personnel to help with
A
the planning earlier but they were people
who had been attached to CIA for temporary
duty on other matters, and they hadn't come
in initially for this specific planning. In
December, when the planning had obviously
started coming in with a beach landing and so
on, the way it turned out, I urged at that
point to get military planning in on the

thing. I was worrying about it. As a matter
of fact, Allen Dulles brought his planners
to a policy meeting, a policy group meeting,

and they were explaining the concept and my
questioning was such that Allen Dulles pleaded
with me not to spoil the plan at an early

-7-

stage. I remember General (Lyman L.)
Lemnitzer was sitting in the meeting
He was chairman of the JCS (Joint Chiefs of
the
Staff) at the time, and he backed up my urging

Alot of people have knowledge of this, by the
end of the Eisenhower administration? throughout government

LANSDALE: I don't know how widespread it was. There
were key executives that were knowledgeable,
there was a small group in the JCS that was

knowledgeable, and there was a planning group
at CIA, but I don't think it went beyond that.
I don't know how far it was known, but I
thought it was rather closely held.

O'BRIEN: You don't know whether the presidential candi-

at the time. At least, the rest of us certainly
didn't know it. I forget exactly when I first
heard it, but it would be possibly October,
but it might have even been November, by the
time I heard about it. As I say, I heard
about it when it was surfaced with the inner
circle of our administration executives.

O'BRIEN: Well, I suppose you had some conversations
with Dulles and with Bissell and some of
these people about it.

LANSDALE: Yes.

O'BRIEN: What's their feeling? You already discussed

became rather impatient with my questioning
of the changed concept when it took place. I thought
Initially if they had the correct personnel

and they had a correct reading of dissent
inside of Cuba, that was a fair chance to do
something. My only concern at the time was/:
did the CIA have the Americans who could work
with such a situation? I just didn't know

of any, but I was assured that there were such
Americans, but I'm not certain that there were.

O'BRIEN: Did you question the kind of intelligence that
was coming out about Cuba and the expected
reaction of Cubans to an invasion and the

reaction to Castro in general?

LANSDALE: Just in very general terms. : I didn't have
enough concrete and specific information
myself that was separate from theirs. Most
of the intelligence take at the time, avail-
able inside the U.S. government, was pretty
colored with this dissatisfaction and state-
ments of it. So, I had no real way of
determining the accuracy or inaccuracy of it.

up with details of whether it could succeed
or not. That was my last advisory role with
him. I was taken off advising on the project
after that, actually by my own request because
I was apparently causing too much trouble and
.. rks of progress.

O'BRIEN: 's the reaction of the Joint Chiefs, people
like Lemnitzer, towards this? Is there an
institutional rivalry or bureaucratic rivalry
here in their minds?

LANSDALE: Somewhat, somewhat. It was a little bit as

seriously. Later, I know, when the JCS got
and helped

in on the actual planning of this, they became
much more serious on it because they had a
share of it.

O'BRIEN: Well, do you get involved in the informing
of McNamara and Gilpatric about this? Do you
get any way of sensing what their reactions
are on first being informed?

LANSDALE: No. They had apparently known by the time I

and the landing has taken place, do you come

LANSDALE: No.

O'BRIEN: You do become involved in Cuban affairs at a

with the Bay of Pigso. They were interested

in the decision-making process, of making of
policy, and asked me if I had any ideas on
how better the President could be served in
the policy decisions and arriving at them.
The thing was right at that moment, McNamara
had previously asked me for the same thing,
and I had come up with a proposal for him
which he put to Kennedy. I just told them
Well, I had some ideas but I had given them
to somebody else, and I was skeptical of the

all I told the Taylor people and told

O'BRIEN: Was he pretty tough

LANSDALE: Well, he wasn't tough. He was the most ineter-
ested of anyone in the room there of what I
would say on things and plague me with many
questions.

O'BRIEN: How were his questions? Was he fairly naive
about the problems?

:LANSDALE: Now, this was on problems questions of how the

government would operate at a decision level,

and they weren't naive at all. He had a very

O'BRIEN: Well, if you, you know, in that period right
after the Bay of Pigs--of course you had a lot
of contacts and friendships in other places
LANSDALE: Yes. O'BRIEN:
outside the Pentagon.. What kind of an impact
does
did the Bay of Pigs have, let's say over in
the Agency, and State Department, and in Defense,
and in the White House?

-18-

LANSDALE: It was a traumatic experience at top levels throughout
of the government. I think it affected
V
President Kennedy more than any other single
thing. It was almost a taboo subject if you
were going in to do business and to get an
approven something over even hinted
Such

intensefully sore subject among all of these
people. I felt that almost all of the key
executives in the administration must have

during the daytime working hours they just
even
didn't even want to contemplate it. And yet

they were honest enough people that they knew
they had to face up and look at it and would do
so, but it was an extremely emotional subject
with them, very much so.
:

O'BRIEN: Well, in terms of the Agency, there's a number
of programs and, of course, involvements in
operations that they have. Do you see any
shift in these, any attempt on the part of the
Defense Department to move into some of these
areas which they felt were traditionally theirs
