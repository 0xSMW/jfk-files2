General Lansdale

OCCURRENCE: The Special Group heard Mr. Merchant state his opinion that the only
solution is to move the Guatemalan train activities to the United States even though
the U. S. could probably not get away with this either. A number of alternative
base sites for the training of the Cubans was considered both in the United States,
in Puerto Rico, at the CIA site on Saipan or in the Panama Canal zone. Mr. Douglas
felt the "U. S. capability for intervention in Cuba will probably not be effective
enough unless there is more overt participation than has been contemplated to date."
"Mr. Grey supported this general position, stating that when the current Cuban
plan was approved, the situation in that country was different than it is now.
Since then, the Cubans have received sizeable amounts of bloc arms and have or-
ganized a malitia. Mr. Gray wondered how a few hundred exiles could be."
"Mr. Mann expressed the opinion that the way to proceed is to seal Cuba off from
the rest of Latin America and settle down for a one- or two-year wait..."

OCCURRENCE:
Lansdale states, "On October 30-31 for an 'Eyes Only' back-
ground memorandum requested by Rosewell Gilpatric, information was requested
from CIA on the current status of all operations. CIA reported all militant
operations have been ordered held at a stop, although the volatile Cubans
were frustrated and not under complete control. The Matahambre operation
was not mentioned by the CIA in reporting in operational teams inside Cuba,
although I asked for specifics on militant teams inside. Two action teams
CIA reported as being inside Cuba were described as in place only collecting
intelligence, not actions, (sabotage,etc.)*

OCCURRENCE: Efforts were made to establish contact with Juana Castro Rug, half sister
of Fidel and Raul Castro Ruz, because she opposed the strong Communist nature of the
Cuban regime. According to Mrs. Virginia Leitaoude Cunha, she contacted Ruzand obtained
Ruz agreement to provide intelligence on the Cuban political leadership and to work
against the Cuban Communist regime, "short of engaging in activity which might result in
direct personal harm to her brothers Raul and Fidel." Arrangements were being made for
direct recruitment of Ruzain Mexico.

OCCURRENCE: SGA discussed various possibilities of accomplishing reconaissance of Cuba, ranging from
very low level coverage by tactical aircraft to high performance aircraft and drones. Over-
flights and peripheral flights were discussed.

It was agreed that the first priority is one high performance mission in the western part of ✓
the island, to be accompanied by all out Elint support. Depending on the results of this,
a number of similar scarches may be mounted. First mission was later approved by higher
authority, but the decision on the second proposition left open.

The entire package was to be discussed at the USIB, and by Chiefs on Wednesday, October 10th.

collection, (5) counterintelligence, (6) communications support, (7) support.

OCCURRENCE: President Kennedy's visit to Mexico greatly enhanced U.S. goodwill in
Mexico. It fulfilled U.S. plans to impress upon Castro that Mexico is solidly with the
United States and the West. State believes this should ease the way for future discussions
about Cuba with the Mexicans. Re: Operation MONGOOSE, the joint communique issued by
* President Kennedy and President Lopez Mateos included a phrase which was 'They proposed
to respect and maintain the principles of non intervention--whether this intervention
may come from a continental or extracontinental state--and of self-determination of
peoples." In response to a Lansdale query, the Department of State noted that "There
were no developments resulting from the President's trip to Mexico including the text
of the joint United States-Mexico communique which alter the basic guidelines which govern
the Cuba Project." Lansdale noted that the CIA now had 45 Asians in Havana operating.
In addition there are agents and teams in the provinces. Voice of Cuba" broadcasts from
the U.S. Navy submarine were successful. "It is noted that UPI carried this news item
but spiced it up with added stories of Castro's use of militia against guerillas in Mantanzas.

OCCURRENCE: McCone explained the situation which has resulted in a group led by
Senor Bosch acquiring B-26's which are now in Costa Rica prepared to conduct a bombing
raid on Cuba. The group discussed a draft State Department cable to various Latin
American embassies related to this incident. It was agreed that the point should be
made in the cable that any such contemplated raid would be premature at this time. Dis-
association of the United States from any such endeavor was to be accomplished by leaking
stories of the impending raid to the press.
