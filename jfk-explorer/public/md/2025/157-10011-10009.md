OCCURRENCE: llelms testified that the aim of the Cuban operations was "to
get rid of Castro or the Castro regime in Cuba; lets put it that way, and no
limitations were placed on the means. In fact, I never recal having been told by
anybody do not do this, do not do that, do not do the other thing." (26) (The
above statements refer to Mongoose.) Helms testified that "the pressure was very
intense and I remember vividly it was very intense.". The pressure led to several
very nutty schemes." (26) Helms testified the pressure built up to the Bay of Pig:
and then lag dormant for awhile and intensified again toward the end of 1961 and
1962. The Cuban Hissile Crisis itself was the period of greatest intensity. After-
ards interest tapered off, although Helms recalled efforts in 1963 involving
economic warfare" such as turning off oil deliveries and stopping bus deliveries

OCCURRENCE:
Meeting of SGA On Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962. Discussion of LANSDALE'S
suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme
sensitivity of any such operation and the disasterous results that would flow
from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to
the-U.S. He went on to say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish
this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the paper. He men-
tioned specifically the possibility of producing crop failuresby the introduction
of biological agen's which would appear to be of natural origin. BUNDY said that
he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear
as a result of local Cuban disaffection or a natural disaster, but that we must
avoid external activities such as release of chemicals, etc. unless they could

OCCURRENCE: When RFK asked Helms for his comments, helms stated that "we were prepared
to get on with the new action program and that we would execute it agressively."
Helms pointed out, however, that the objective of Operation MONGOOSE would have to be
determined at some point since the Cubans with whom we have to work were seeking a
reason for risking their lives in these operations. Helms detailed his conversation
with the young Cuban from the EDRE who pointed out that they were willing to
commit people only on operations which they regarded as sensible. Helms defines.
sensible in Cuban terminology as meaning an action which would contribute to the liberatic
of their country, another way of saying that the United States, perhaps in conjunction
with other Latin American countries, would bail them out militarily. Helms' point
was specially echoed by Huston and Ryan.
