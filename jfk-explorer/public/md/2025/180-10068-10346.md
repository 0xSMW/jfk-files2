Status of Document:	Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 15

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

3331 House Annex # 2

Dear Tom:

Here, without further delay or adue, is my repayment of the overpayment.
You will note that it is made out to the U.S. Treasury or the Committee. This is
due to the fact that I never recieved your note of September 15, so I was not
sure who this was to be made out to. You may instruct those fine fellows at the
Payroll Department, however, that I had an exquisitely fine time with my unexpected
'manna from bureaucratic heaven'.
Also, I wish you would advise Donovan to advise Blakey's office that I am
still waiting breathlessly for their letter of recommendation. Please tell him
(them) that I will not be able to obtain credit for my arduous labors of the summer
until I recieve some sort of recommendation.
Thus, with all the sincerety due the occasion, I am,

Sincerely,

John J. Farmer, Jr.

P.S. Say hello to Kevin Walsh and Edwin Lopez for me. Tell Edwin that I am now
a lifetime member of the "Reggie Jackson for Messiah" fan club.

Dear John:

In reference to my letter of September 15, 1977, the
House Finance Office informs me that in settling your over-
payment, they will adjust various withholdings, that were made
from your salary.

Accordingly, the amount of the check that you send to
us should be $199.38 instead of $220.00.

Sincerely,

Thomas Howarth

Mr. John Farmer
1001 Rockville Pike, #1819
Rockville, MD 20852

Dear John:

Through an oversight, the Research Unit failed
to notify the Budget Office that you had terminated
your services with the Select Committee. As a
consequence, you were overpaid for the month of
August.

As I understand the facts, you worked through
Friday, August 12 and that Mr. Gay gave you vacation
through Friday, August 19. Therefore, you were
overpaid for the period August 20-31, 1977 which
amounts to a gross salary of $220.00.

If you agree with the facts, I must request
from you in the name of the House of Representatives,
the return of House funds in the amount of $220.00.
The check should be made payable to the U. S.
Treasury and sent to me in care of the Committee.

If you dispute the facts, kindly get in touch
with me as soon as possible so that we can settle
the matter.

Kind regards and good luck in your classes at
school.

Sincerely,

Thomas Howarth

FROM: Donovan L. Gay

RE: John Farmer

Early August, 1977, John Farmer, The Committee's
summer intern, informed me that he would be registering
for classes on August 26, 1977, and would like some time
off commencing August 15, 1977, so he could vacation with
his family for two weeks.

Based on the countless hours he devoted, and on
John's overall performance, which was exceptional, I took
it upon myself to grant him the week of August 14, 1977
to accommodate his vacation plans. Therefore, he should
have been taken off our payroll ending August 20, 1977.

However, I erred in failing to notify you earlier
on the above, as I thought I had already done. Therefore,
John Farmer was in fact paid for the remainder of the month
of August, 1977.

Should there be additional questions on this matter,
please contact me immediately. Furthermore, I can assure
you that in the future, you will be notified immediately
with regard to personnel changes.

Thank you.
