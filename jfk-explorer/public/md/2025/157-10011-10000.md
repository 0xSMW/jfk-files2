OCCURRENCE: The Special Group discussed (1) the possibility of providing sixty
thousand dollars from the Cuba budget to sponsor the religious activity of Father
Peyton in Cuba; (2) a proposal to survey the possibility of establishing a strike
base in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military
men to CIA. "Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700
Cubans is any longer practicable. He said that it had been his understanding that
-the-current-thinking-contemplated_figures_more_on_the_order_of_3,000." Mr. Barnes
replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as
a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as
3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed
it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in
addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

OCCURRENCE: Lansdale briefed the group on numbers of agents in Cuba. Air resupply
proposal submitted by CIA "should be deferred pending broader review of the entire
situation." Taylor noted if urgent need for air supply proposal could be made to the
Special Group Augmented at any time. "Mr. McCone emphasized that no high-level penetra-
tions of the Cuban government have yet been attained." "The Attorney General inquired
about the status of popular support for Castro, and also the possibility of a revolt
_against_him." Lansdale_replied, "There is no rallying point for active opposition."
The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities
by Castro in the hemisphere. A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of
July. Taylor emphasized need for summaries of results "and a statement of future al-
ternatives open to the U.S. should be developed." Looking into proposal to subsidize
Japanese purchases of Dominican sugars so that the Japanese could divert these purchases
from Cuba. McCone said that his experts had informed him that from a legal point of view,

OCCURRENCE: Efforts were made to establish contact with Juana Castro Rug, half sister
of Fidel and Raul Castro Ruz, because she opposed the strong Communist nature of the
Cuban regime. According to Mrs. Virginia Leitao ao de Cunha, she contacted Ruz and obtained
Ruz agreement to provide intelligence on the Cuban political leadership and to work
against the Cuban Communist regime, "short of engaging in activity which might result in
direct personal charm to her brothers Raul and Fidel. Arrangements were being made for
direct recruitment of Ruz in Mexico.

OCCURRENCE: Lansdale traces the history of the project from its inception on Nov. 30,
1961 through March 1, 1962. Under the latter date, he notes, "The Chief of Operations
/Lansdale/is to report to the President through the Special Group (NSC 5412 Augmented
by the Attorney General and the Chairman, JCS); the Special Group will be responsible for
providing policy guidance for approving important operations, and for monitoring progress."
(00181) Lansdale also submitted an intelligence plan for basic intelligence collection
upon which to base the decision to undertake actions to cause the overthrow of Castro.
The plan itself-at-pages-00183-through-00187, included establishing intelligence agents-
inside Cuba; collecting intelligence from Cubans inside the United States; counterfeiting
ration cards and currency inside of Cuba; geographical surveys of air fields, military
installations, communications centers; attempts to place trained agents inside the government
organizations or to defect officials "in place"; and negotiating for British help in
contaminating lubricants and fuels to cripple Cuban transportation. "The British want to
know, how serious are your?, before risking their assets to help the us.." (00180-00187)

OCCURRENCE: Memo for Richard Helms from Gen. Lansdale concerning NSA cover.
The memo
alludes to a conversation on the previous day, Jan. 31, 1962, about NSA cover for the
Cuba Project. It indicates that Cuba cover is top priority. It indicated that this was not
possibly known to the members of the United States Intelligence Board. The problem seemed to Sec 6(1)(b)(c)
be to be able to decide how much of NSA (National Security Agency)'s assets were needed to
provide cover for the Cuban project.

"very nutty schemes." (26) Helms testified the pressure built up to the Bay of Piga

Western Hemisphere support for OAS resolutions condemning Cuba and isolating it from the
rest of the hemisphere. "The OAS meeting is to be supported by public demonstrations in
Latin America, generated by CIA and a psychological campaign assisted by USIA." The major
task_of the_diplomatic_capability_was_to encourage Latin American leaders to develop
independent operations similar to the instant project seeking an internal revolt of the
Cuban people against the Communist regime. In the economic warfare area an embargo on
Cuban trade was to be considered after the OAS meeting. The CIA was unable to undertake
the action to sabotage the sugar harvest which commences about January 15 and upon which
Cuba's one-crop economy depended. Sabotage of transport, mills, sugar sacking in cane
fields was explored, according to Lansdale's review. Special sabotage support was noted.→

OCCURRENCE: It was agreed that Harvey was to work towards reaching a stage in the
interrogation of Pedro Roig, the Cuban economic official who defected to Mexico, where
the can be surfaced to make public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin
American nations. Harvey was to generate a story from Cuban refugee sources that the
original Cardenas incident consisted of a demonstration concerning the shortage of food.
This was to cause ridicule of the Communist regime's use of MIGs, tanks and troops against
_the_unarmed_people_of Cardenas. "The Cuban-source-to-story need not await your determina-

OCCURRENCE:
Due to reports of popular unrest, political strife, and economic disruptions
inside Cuba, it was suggested that the Special Group Augmented consider the value of
having an SNIE on Cuba made in the immediate future. The CIA has agreed as a matter of
priority to reach a stage in the the interrog interrogation of Pedro Roig, where he can be surfaced
to make public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin American nations.
For operational effectiveness, the CIA has selected a new area in Cuba for its initial
radio broadcasts from a submarine for "Voice of Cuba." The Navy states that the new
area is feasible and State has concurred in the theme and content of the broadcast. They
will take place around the end of the month. _No_proposals_for_actions-by-the-Department
of State have been submitted since the appointment of State's special representative,
Mr. Hurwitch. They are expected on June 22, 1962.

MONGOOSE
OCCURRENCE:
Due to reports of popular unrest, political strife, and economic disruptions
inside Cuba, it was suggested that the Special Group Augmented consider the value of
having an SNIE on Cuba made in the immediate_future. The CIA has agreed as a matter of
priority to reach a stage in the interrogation of Pedro Roig where he can be surfaced
to make public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin American nations.
For operational effectiveness, the CIA has selected a new area in Cuba for its initial
radio broadcasts from a submarine for "Voice of Cuba." The Navy states that the new
area is feasible and State has concurred in the theme and content of the broadcast. They
_will_take_place_around-the-end-of-the-month. No-proposals-for-actions-by-the-Department
of State have been submitted since the appointment of State's special representative,
Mr. Hurwitch. They are expected on June 22, 1962.
