On 3/15/67, the Liaison Agent met with Richard
Helms, Director, CIA, and took the opportunity to review
the status of relations between FBI and CIA. It was
felt that this was an opportune time to do so in view of
the Director's concern as expressed above.

Helms stated that he personally was pleased with
relations between the two Agencies. He stated that sometimes
he is irked or disturbed when people outside and inside of
the Government ask the question "How are you getting along
with the FBI?" He indicated that this question is frequently
asked by members of Congress. Helms stated that he
religiously has followed a practice of lucidly and firmly
advising such people that relations are excellent. He
stated that he personally believed that this was true.

The Liaison Agent commented that working relations
are good, but there was an area which might not be getting
proper attention. The Agent stated that there was reason
to be concerned regarding effective coordination on those
cases which are of interest to both FBI and CIA because there
appeared to be developing an atmosphere where people in both
Agencies felt that there was now wide-open liberty to conduct
operations and activities of a joint nature. The Agent
stated that he wished to emphasize that such an atmosphere
cannot exist and that Mr. Hoover would never condone any
trend in this direction. The Agent commented that work in
this area had to be very efficiently coordinated and that we
in the Bureau were closely scrutinizing each situation as it
develops where both Agencies had an interest. The Agent
suggested that Mr. Helms might desire to alert appropriate
subordinates in the Agency on this point.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

On 3/15/67, PSI EMIL R. SVEILIS, the late night
desk editor, United Press International, Washington, D. C.
who has furnished reliable information in the past, said
that he wished to advise this office that he overheard
comments indicating that CIA had contributed at least one
million dollars to the National Council of Churches. He
also advised that he understood that the CIA maintains a
"safe house at the Airle House, Warrenton, Virginia." He
was questioned specifically about the source of the above
information and indicated that he believed that he heard
this information from individuals connected with the news
media but he could not recall the exact identity of these
individuals. He indicated that he got the impression
that this information was common knowledge in the news
field.
The Bureau may wish to advise CIA by appropriate
channels concerning the information that the CIA had
allegedly contributed money to the National Council of
Churches and maintains a "safe house" at Warrenton,
Virginia. This information was not put in LHM form
because of its general character and because the PSI
was unable to recall his source of this information
or when the information came to his attention.
The PSI requested that his identity be protected.

SUBJECT CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)
ALIEN INTERVIEW REQUESTS

Re memorandum Cotter to Sullivan dated 3/28/67,
which instructed the Liaison Agent to advise appropriate
CIA representatives of the change in handling alien inter-
view requests at the Bureau.

On 3/31/67, the Liaison Agent advised (Mr. Leo
Dunn of the change in handling alien interview requests
at FBI Headquarters. (Dunn was advised that the overall
coordination for handling these requests would be handled
by the Bureau's Name Check Section under the coordination
of Special Agent J. W. Brown.

Inasmuch as CIA occasionally makes a telephonic
request when expedite matters are involved, the Liaison
Agent obtained the names of Eugene Young and Becky Vaughn
as the persons who would call Special Agent Brown in the
event an expedite matter is involved. CIA is well aware
that the use of this telephonic request should be held to
a minimum and used only at times when time is of the
essence and the matter is of sufficient importance to
deviate from the normal request procedures.

ACTION:
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED EXCEPT
WHERE SHOWN OTHERWISE.

The above is directed to the Name Check Section
for their information and attention.
