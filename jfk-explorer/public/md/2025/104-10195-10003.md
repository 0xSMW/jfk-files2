APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP
in the 'CAREER STAFF of the
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

To the Director of Central Intelligence
Sir:
I submit herewith my application for membership in the Career Staff of the
Central Intelligence Agency as defined below:

"The Career Staff of the Central Intelligence Agency is a group of
carefully selected and trained individuals who accept an obligation to
devote themselves to the needs of the Agency, and who intend to make
a career with the Agency."

In accordance with this definition, I desire to devote myself to the faith-
ful performance of duty in the Central Intelligence Agency, and I accept the
obligations and conditions of that service which are determined to be essen-
tial to the furtherance of its mission.

I am aware of the many restrictions necessarily placed upon me by virtue
of the security requirements inherent in my employment by the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. I am also aware that as a member of the Career Staff, it will
be my obligation to serve anywhere and at any time and for any kind of duty
as determined by the needs of the Agency, and I have been assured that in
order to carry out this policy, full consideration will be given to my particular
capabilities, interests, and personal circumstances. By virtue of this applica-
tion for membership and upon my acceptance in the Career Staff, I am assured
that, with continuing satisfactory work performance and conduct on my part,
just and equitable attention will be accorded my personal progress during my
tenure in the Career Staff. I am also assured that, on my satisfactory com-
pletion of any assignments, I will be offered reassignments which are compati-
ble insofar as possible with my abilities and career interests, and that I shall
be entitled to the benefits now available or to be made available in the future
to members of the Career Staff of the Central Intelligence Agency.
