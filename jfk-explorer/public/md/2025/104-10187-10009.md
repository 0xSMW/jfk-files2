1. IN RESPONSE REF A QUESTION, AVAILABILITY IS MAIN
FEATURE, BUT EASE IN ADMINISTRATION AND SECURITY ARE ALSO
FACTORS INFLUENCING OUR PROPOSAL TO COMBINE PHOTO OPERATION
WITH KDVAULT TECHNICAL OPERATION. APARTMENT UNDER EARLIER
CONSIDERATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL PROBABLY SOMETIME
IN MAY, AND WE DO NOT NOW HAVE ANY SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO
TAKE POSSESSION WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. COMBINING BOTH
OPERATIONS WILL REDUCE NUMBER ASSETS INVOLVED, COSTS, AGENT
MEET INGS AND PROJECT ADMIN. SECURITY WILL BE ENHANCED BECAUSE
TWO ACTIVE SITES IN SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY CKPOLAR INSTALLATION
WOULD DOUBLE COVER PROBLEMS AND DOUBLE NUMBER OF CLANDESTINE
MEETINGS TO RETRIVE PRODUCT.
2. IN SUM, BOTH APARTMENTS IN QUESTION HAVE ESSENTIALLY
SAME DESIRABILITY FEATURES FOR KDVAULT OPERATION.

ACTION REQUIRED:	None; for your information and files.
REFERENCE
: ΗΜΜΑ-41,734, 10 March 1972 (Previous Report)

INTRODUCTION
1. The KDFACTOR Project has been terminated because of develop-
ments reported in other channels. This will be the last of the opera-
tional reports forwarded to Headquarters and primarily a wrap-up of
developments to date.

OPERATIONS
2. The KDFACTOR Project supported two visual and photographic
surveillance points (KDLITERAL and NDABSINTHE) directed against the
MHIHARSH installation. Operations from the KDLITERAL surveillance
point were suspended on 4 July 1972, the equipment removed on 7 July,
and the operator, KDFACTOR-2, terminated the same date. Operations
from the KDABSINTHE surveillance point were suspended on 28 July, the
equipment removed on 29 July, and termination of KDFACTOR-5 and his
family accomplished the same date.

ADMINISTRATION
3. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for
inside administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Processing of the photo product was accomplished inside the Station.

PERSONNEL

4. The project included five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operated the KDLITERAL basehouse. NDFACTOR-5 operated the KDABSINTHE
basehouse with the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons
KDFACTOR-8 and 9. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 have served BKTRUST in
their photo specialty since 1957.

5. KDFACTOR-2 will continue to reside in the NDLITERAL building,
as part of his termination agreement, until probably sometime in
December when he will move to new quarters of his own. The KDLITERAL
building (MEXI-03, Unit 15) is part of the KDVAULT complex of build-
ings which will be disposed of as reported in other channels. If this
occurs before December, KDFACTOR-2 will move at the time of disposal.

6. KDFACTOR-5 and his family will vacate the KDABSINTHE apart-
ment o/a 31 August. KDABSINTHE is located in a building owned by
KDABBEY who plans to dispose of his equity in the property in the
near future.
PRODUCTION
7. KDLITERAL: Before being closed down, KDLITERAL, through
KDFACTOR-2, was the source of within-the-compound photographic cover-
age of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers. He provided an average of three rolls
of film a week and provided weekly written reports based on his
visual observation of the target area.

8. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced an
average of six rolls of film a week and was our principal source for
information on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, especially
"WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles. This segment of KDFACTOR
was also our main source of information on MHHARSH license plates
and automobiles.

9. In addition, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both provided detailed
"attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. With the loss of this
combined coverage, it will be difficult to identity personnel assigned
to the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements in
and out of the compound. The two surveillance points also provided
periodic photo studies of the MHHARSH installation itself with empha-
sis on coverage of the construction changes and modification or addi-
tions made to the communications antenna system.
SECURITY

10. We were gratified to receive the very favorable Headquarters
KDFACTOR security review which was forwarded as HMMW-19,061, 28 June
1972. There is no need for further comment.

PROBLEMS

11. Only the developments reported in other channels.
FINANCES

12. KDFACTOR Project termination costs have been charged to
FY 1972 with the exception of rent payments and utility costs which
are being charged to FY 1973. The breakdown of agent termination
costs is as follows:
|
PLANS
KDFACTOR-2	$102,000
KDFACTOR-5	29,575
KDFACTOR-6	35,380
KDFACTOR-8	8,112

OPERATIONS

1.	The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.

ADMINISTRATION

2. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for inside
administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Bruce H. FERNALD, who previously handled the assets, is the alternate
case officer and would be available to take over agent meeting respon-
sibilities in the absence of MANKUNAS. Processing of the photo
product is accomplished inside the Station. Agent meetings have now
been cut to a minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery
to the consumer has been speeded up.

PERSONNEL

3. The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operates the KDLITERAL basehouse and has been employed in this capa-
city since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE basehouse with
the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons, KDFACTOR-8
and -9. KDFACTOR-5 has also served BKTRUST in this capacity since
1957.

PRODUCTION

4. KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL, through
KDFACTOR-2, continued to be the source of within-the-compound photo-
graphic coverage of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers. He produced 55 rolls of

film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily visual
observation of the target area.
5. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced
100 rolls of film and continued to be the principal source for infor-
mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atten-
tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.
This segment of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of
information on MHHARSH license plates and automobiles.

6. KDLITERAL and XDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed
"attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. Without this combined
coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to
the MHHARSH..installation or to monitor their daily movements and
activities. In addition, the two surveillance points provide periodic
photo studies of the MHHARSH installation itself with emphasis on
coverage of any constructionchanges and any modification or additions
made to the communications antenna system. Both sites are also
available to service special support requests as required. During
the period, KDLITERAL performed a number of special photo surveys and
a three-week frequency sweep requested by WOACRE.
