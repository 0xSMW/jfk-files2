Dear Itr. Hoover:

Summarily

With reference to your letter of 11 June 1947 requesting
information on policy matters discussed by Foster and certain
members of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party
in Paris, I should like to summarize the action taken by this
organization on Foster's trip. All stations on Foster's
itinerary were alerted during the British Empire Conference with
emphasis placed upon Foster's contacts and the content of his
conversations with foreign Gommunist afric officials at Paris, Bol
and Prague.

The first reaction from Paris reported Foster's meeting with
Thorez and Duclos and on 7 March and a planned meeting for the next
day with other members of the Central Committee (this information
was distributed to you in DD-3658 on 4 April 1947). No adequate
follow-up on this original report was subsequently produced - a
fact to be accounted for primarily by the hesitation of the Surete
Nationale, for political reasons, to give Foster's visit adequate
investigative attention (as reported to you in DB-4777 of 1 July
1947).

Information on the policy matters discussed at this meeting,
however, was included in a report from H.I.6, Section 7, in May
(copy enclosed herewith). Although the source of this report did
not know precisely what happened at this meeting "because great
secrecy was observed, he mentioned several specific topics
allegedly under discussion. This report was not forwarded to you
since it was assumed the report was handed directly to your London
representative by the British.

"On 10.3.47, our representative in Rome reported that FOSTER
had arrived there on 14.3.47. for a stay of a few days.

"On 1.4.47., we heard from Belgrade that according to local
press reports of 25,3.47., FOSTER had left Jugoslavia on
24.3.47. No details were given regarding his destination,

"A report dated 1.4.47 from Paris, stated that after the
British Communist Party Congress in London, several important
delegates had arrived in Paris among whom were William Z.
FOSTER, Tim BUCK LAHAUT, Chief of the Belgian Communist Party,
who had not been in London, and who arrived direct from Brust els
and Harry POLLITT. At the same time several Communist delegates
who had been present at the W.I.D.F. Congress in Prague, had
also arrived in Paris, including Nina POPOVA, the U.S.S.R. dele-
gate, as well as delegates from Greece, Brazil, Cube, and the
Viet-Nam. Our source, however, does not know names of any
except those mentioned.

"Several meetings were held at the Headquarters of the Central
Committee of the French Communist Party at 44, rue Le Paletier.
At one of these meetings the following were known to have been
present: William FOSTER, Tim BUCK, Dolores IBARRURI, Nina
POPOVA, FaurigerTHOREZ, Andre MARTY, Jacques SUCLOSAUVAIS,
CACHIN, BERLIDERACHON MONMOUSSEAU RAJON, Robert ARETIT, and
also George WILLIAMS GAICHAILOV, Comintern Delegate.

*"John PITTMAN, Paris correspondent of the American Da ly Worker'
had acted as interpreter. Although our source does not know
much of what happened at this meeting because great secrecy was
bbserved, he states that the meeting was concerned with uniting
of world democratic forces against international reaction. In
this connection, the French Communist leaders are said to have
very much regretted the difficulty of bringing about the union
between the American Federation of Labour, and the Congress of
Industrial Organizations in the U.S.A.
