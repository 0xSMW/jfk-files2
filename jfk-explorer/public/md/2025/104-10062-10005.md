Per your telephonic request of
OLC yesterday afternoon, here are the
6D0120 last known addresses for "Pete"
Bagley and Newton S. Miler. We
have no phone numbers.

Mr. Bagley retired COVERTLY so
Shep's and my recommendation is
that if he is contacted he should
be approached in a discreet manner
so his cover is not blown. Addi-
tionally, he has retired in Europe
so it might be wiser not to inter-
view him at all unless it is
absolutely necessary. His last
known address is:

56 Chemin du Gros Tienne
1328 Ohain
Belgium

(NOTE: Rodger please call me for
additional information on "Pete".)

Mr. Miler retired openly; his last
known address is:
