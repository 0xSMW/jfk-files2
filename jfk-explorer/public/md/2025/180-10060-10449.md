absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 5

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.
