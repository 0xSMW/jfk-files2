The document mentions: \"if it were discovered that AMBUNNY-1 was a penetration of the UNSNAFU-19 office (by the Cubans) his connection with ODYOKE would then be revealed, with the result that all his 'connections' with UNSNAFU-19, and 'Habana' would be lost.\"",

  "summary": "A memorandum details a meeting between AMBUNNY-1, AMWHIP-1, and DAMICONE (alias AL MARIN) regarding concerns about AMBUNNY-1's background potentially compromising a planned operation. AMWHIP-1 suggests using a cutout to introduce AMBUNNY-1 to UNSNAFU-19, and a planned Paris operation is canceled, with AMBUNNY-1 possibly being utilized in Rabat instead.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "This memorandum, dated June 2, 1965, documents a meeting convened on May 25, 1965, between AMBUNNY-1, AMWHIP-1, and Norris W. Damicone (using the alias AL MARIN) at AMWHIP-1's New York office. The discussion centered on AMWHIP-1's reservations about AMBUNNY-1's background, particularly her previous employment with the U.S. Ambassador in Bolivia, which he feared could expose his connections with ODYOKE and UNSNAFU-19 to Cuban intelligence. AMWHIP-1 proposed using a cutout to mitigate this risk, while a planned operation in Paris was canceled due to AMWHIP-1â€™s unavailability; AMBUNNY-1 may be reassigned to Rabat.",
