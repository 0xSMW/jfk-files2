  "security": "This document pertains to notifying a former employee about the potential public release of their name under the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The message indicates that the agency must present a compelling case to prevent the release if it poses a credible threat to the individual, their family, or sensitive activities. Quoting directly: 'YOUR NAME CANNOT BE REDACTED FROM THE DOCUMENTS TO BE RELEASED UNLESS WE CAN PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THIS RELEASE WOULD POSE A CREDIBLE THREAT TO YOU PERSONALLY, YOUR FAMILY, OR ANY SENSITIVE ACTIVITY'. Revealing this internal process might expose methods for managing personnel information and compliance with legal mandates, potentially leading to public scrutiny or legal challenges.",
