Mather documented a meeting with Niel Ainsley, Billy Morgan, Michael Kalanick, and James McDonald to discuss the possible acquisition of 25 million rounds of 7.62 Soviet ammunition from I. Irving Davidson. The officials weighed the logistical benefits of securing a five-year supply against the security concerns arising from Davidson's \"unsavory reputation\" and ties to columnist Jack Anderson. Alternatives were considered, including approaching Davidson through legitimate arms dealers or identifying Davidson's source to bypass him, with instructions given to the Washington Field Office to disclaim CIA interest to Davidson.",
