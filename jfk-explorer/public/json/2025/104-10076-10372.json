  "summary_one_paragraph": "This secret telegram, dated December 12, 1963, from UMWAVE to the Director, relays information regarding truck traffic and the sighting of tube-like objects entering the Torrens base near Havana, Cuba. The report, based on observations between October 9 and November 7, 1963, from a former Cuban government employee, indicates that almost every night, trucks covered with canvas were seen traveling toward Torrens, and on two occasions, large trailer trucks entered the base. A source, identified as REBECA (ALBERT), whose uncle, JUAN FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ, reported that tube-like objects protruded from one of the trailers when the wind blew the tarpaulin aside. The field comment notes that the Torrens surface-to-air missile assembly area was active during this period.",
