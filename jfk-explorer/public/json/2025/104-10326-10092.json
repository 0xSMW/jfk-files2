Specifically, detailing the subjects discussed (Middle East peace process, aid to Bosnian Muslims, Somalia, environmental task force) could be exploited. Mentioning names like Leonid ((RYABCHENYA)) and Oleg ((NECHIPORENKO)) might expose individuals to unwanted scrutiny. Additionally, the request for a copy of the unclassified paper \"by the most expeditious means possible\" reveals a specific operational concern about information accessibility.",
