  "security": "Disclosing details about AMMUG-1's defection (paragraph 2 of Memorandum WH/COG 70-46) and the Agency's efforts to secure his citizenship could compromise his safety or expose sensitive operational methods. Additionally, revealing plans to approach Roberto Rodriguez Llompart for recruitment (paragraph 3 of UFAA-1845) could jeopardize potential intelligence gains. The document contains explicit operational details (e.g., watchlist instructions for Roberto Rodriguez Llompart) that could reveal intelligence-gathering methods. Quoting specific examples: \"WH/MIAMI HAS GOOD ASSESSMENT FROM AMMUG-1...ON ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ LLOMPART\" and \"PLS QUERY UNCOSMIC-1 FOR ANY FURTHER DETAILS HE CAN RECALL ABOUT TALKS WITH ROBERTO.\" Such content, if exposed, would be detrimental to ongoing or future intelligence activities.",
