  "security": "This memo details the exposure of CIA personnel by Philip Agee, including their roles and assignments. Revealing this information could compromise ongoing operations, endanger individuals, and damage the CIA's ability to conduct intelligence activities. Listing the individuals, their assignments, and their exposure in various publications, like 'Who's Who in CIA' and Agee's book, poses a significant risk. For example, the memo states: 'BUSTOS, Charlotte BUSTOS-VIDELA, Charlotte B., SF#56 840; appears to be Chief of Station at Trinidad since June 1974, integrated State cover. Well known to AGEE through assignment to Mexico City, July 1967-August 1972.'",
