  "summary_one_paragraph": "An agent report from October 27, 1958, details an employment check conducted on Robert Scheer, a pre-inductee, by Paul F. Rohde of the 108th CIC Group. The investigation centered on Scheer's employment at Hilltop Lodge in Sylvan Lake, New York, during July and August 1953. Paul Wolfson, former co-owner of Hilltop Lodge, provided information about Scheerâ€™s role as a waiter, his pay rate of $60 monthly, and his reason for leaving at the end of the summer season. Wolfson described Scheer as an honest, trustworthy, and reliable employee, noting that he was eligible for rehire and was planning to attend Queens College in September 1953. The agent's notes indicate difficulty in securing a personal interview with Wolfson, who eventually provided the information via a phone call to the 108th CIC Group after receiving a letter requesting an interview.",
