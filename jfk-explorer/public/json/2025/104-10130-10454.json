  "summary_one_paragraph": "A memorandum dated July 28, 1975, outlines the CIA's relationship with George R. Wackenhut and his company, Wackenhut Corporation. Initiated in May 1960, the relationship was established to provide cover support for Agency employees in Florida, leading to a Covert Security Approval in November 1961. This approval was rescinded in April 1967 due to Wackenhut's increased public notoriety. However, in November 1974, it was discovered that Wackenhut Corporation was providing guard services to Global Marine Development, Incorporated, a firm associated with the Agency's DDS&T office, although no action was taken to terminate this arrangement.",
