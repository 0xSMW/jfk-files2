State Department cover is critically important because its use affords our officers the rights and privileges set forth in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic and Consular Immunity--diplomatic immunity, in particular.\" Disclosing this information could compromise the security of CIA officers and their operations.",

Carey appeals to Judge John Raymond Tunheim, Chairman of the Assassination Records Review Board, to reconsider the release of documents exposing the CIA's use of State Department cover. Carey emphasizes that this cover is critical for CIA officers' security and operational effectiveness overseas, enabling them to work in hostile environments and maintain relationships with allied liaison services. He contends that revealing this practice would increase risks for both CIA officers and State Department colleagues, and he offers a senior CIA representative to further explain the Agency's concerns and provide a more comprehensive memorandum on the damage issue.",
