The document specifies that the cryptonym FUTURE is likely a garble for FI/LA Division's FUTURE, assigned to a U.S. citizen operating abroad as a reporting source, whose true identity is withheld for security reasons. It also identifies KUTUBE as referring to FI Staff (now Operations Staff), LIVID as a sensitive foreign operational target, and LAURICLE as an action indicator for FI/D. Further, it reveals that Monroe B. ROZENEY, Ed JOUVENOY, Wanda CRICKARD, and James N. RABNEY are pseudonyms for various officers and clerks, including IDENTITY A (Oliver M. Silsby), an officer actively involved in clandestine operations, and IDENTITY B (Elizabeth A. McNeill), a former Agency employee.",
