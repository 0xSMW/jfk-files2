For example, 'Office of Security records reflect that an individual, probably identical to Steve Van Cleave of Atlanta, Georgia, had falsely claimed to the State Department in January 1974 that he worked for CIA in Latin America under cover of Coca Cola Company.' This information, if disseminated, could prompt similar fraudulent claims or obstruct future investigations.",
