  "security": "This memo details potential damage to CIA Miami from the prosecution of the Masferrer group, including publicity focusing on the Miami Station, its cover firm (Holman Corporation), and the University of Miami's involvement. It also mentions the risk of disaffected former agents and exile groups disclosing details of CIA operations against Cuba. Specifically, the memo states, 'it will be very easy for the defense to drag CIA Miami into the case...begin a chain reaction surfacing much detail and rumor concerning CIA operations against the Cuban target'. The risk of undermining ongoing operations against Cuba and disclosing sensitive information about agents and methods is high.",

  "summary": "A memorandum outlining potential damage to CIA activities in Miami resulting from the Justice Department's decision to seek a Grand Jury indictment against Rolando Masferrer and his associates for a planned Haitian invasion.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "This secret memorandum, dated February 24, 1967, assesses the potential damage to CIA activities in Miami due to the Justice Department's pursuit of a Grand Jury indictment against Rolando Masferrer's Haitian invasion group. It warns that adverse publicity and local press scrutiny could expose CIA's ties to the University of Miami, Zenith Technical Enterprises Inc., and Holman Corporation, potentially jeopardizing the cooperation of university officials and leading to the surfacing of sensitive information regarding CIA operations against Cuban targets, especially given the risk from disgruntled former agents and exile groups seeking to discredit the agency and influence US policy.",
