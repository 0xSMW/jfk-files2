  "summary": "This report details information on Jose Fernandez, a high-ranking Cuban military officer, noting his roles in army training, defense preparations, and his complex relationship with the Castro regime.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "This August 1964 CIA report compiles personality information on Jose Fernandez, a key figure in the Cuban military. The report, sourced from a former Cuban Intelligence officer and supplemented by agency records, describes Fernandez as the chief of all army training schools and a significant military strategist, particularly in defense preparations. Despite attending artillery schools in the U.S. and being described as non-Communist, Fernandez maintains a crucial role under Fidel Castro due to his military expertise, even though Castro is likely aware of Fernandez's anti-Communist leanings. The CIA cautions against taking any action against Fernandez without consulting the Agency.",
