  "summary_one_paragraph": "On September 28, 1974, John D. Morrison, Jr., and Ray Rocca met with E. Howard Hunt, his attorney William A. Snyder, Jr., and Snyderâ€™s associate Thomas W. Coons at the DCD Washington Field Office to review Hunt's memoirs, \"Undercover.\" During the meeting, they discussed and agreed upon changes to both classified and unclassified items in the manuscript, including the fabrication of a Shanghai post, entry into a non-specific embassy in Mexico City, joint CIA-Uruguayan telephone monitoring operation, and the deletion of names of certain individuals to protect their cover. The discussion also covered the risk of the publisher resisting the changes and the potential for negative publicity, and Hunt expressed hope that the Agency would not issue a press release, but Morrison persuaded him that a public acknowledgment of the review would be beneficial.",
