  "security": "The documents discuss internal CIA procedures and interactions with external bodies such as the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) and the LBJ Library. Releasing internal correspondence about document retrieval, compliance efforts, and classification processes could reveal internal workflows and potentially expose sensitive information management practices. For example, the mention of limiting access to sensitive material to specific individuals (Jeremy Gunn, David Marwell) within the ARRB highlights concerns about information control. Exposing these procedures could compromise the agency's ability to manage sensitive information effectively.",
