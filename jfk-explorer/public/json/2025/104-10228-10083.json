  "summary_one_paragraph": "This top-secret message, dated April 19, 1961, relays information regarding the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba, where a strike force of Cuban revolutionaries, HUGERINI 1200, landed at Cochinos Bay on April 17. The message indicates that while the rebels initially secured beachheads, the GOC (Government of Cuba) established air superiority using T-33 jet trainers and MiG-8s, and by April 18, up to 12 Soviet-built tanks were deployed. The rebel forces lost a beachhead on April 17 and their remaining foothold by April 19, primarily due to an inability to resupply, withstand tank assaults, and overwhelming enemy manpower; police action also prevented civilian support. Full details were not available, but psychological guidance was to follow.",
