Attempts to locate Rivera at 201 Roebling Street, New York City, revealed that the address was in Brooklyn, not Manhattan or the Bronx. A phone listing existed for Maria Rivera at that address, but repeated calls went unanswered. A physical check confirmed that the Rivera family had moved approximately one month prior, and a postal removal notice indicated that Hugo Rivera's new address was 2020 Walton Avenue, Bronx, New York 10453.",
