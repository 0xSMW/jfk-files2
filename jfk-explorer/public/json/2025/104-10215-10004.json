  "summary_one_paragraph": "This set of documents, dated from May to June 1963, details the process of securing appropriate cover for CIA agent Ross Crozier. Initially, a request was made to the Central Cover Staff to provide Crozier with military cover for operational and credit purposes while he was assigned in the Headquarters area. Concerns about his physical location in a DODS office, which was under commercial cover, caused reluctance. Later, SAS addressed this issue by moving Crozier out of the DODS area, requesting new office space, and emphasizing the urgency of providing the necessary military cover for Crozier, who also had a history of intelligence assignments in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Cuba.",
