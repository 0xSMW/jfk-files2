  "security": "Disclosing internal discussions and recommendations about organizational restructuring and personnel assignments could compromise the CIA's operational effectiveness and strategic planning. Specifically, details concerning the creation of new divisions, task forces, and the reallocation of responsibilities could reveal vulnerabilities in the agency's structure. For example, the document states: 'A Special Task Force is created for such operations of a magnitude that transcends the capabilities of one division,' and 'Assistant DD/P for Paramilitary and Air Support Operations created.' Sharing these details could expose the Agency's approach to handling large-scale operations and specialized capabilities, potentially aiding adversaries.",
