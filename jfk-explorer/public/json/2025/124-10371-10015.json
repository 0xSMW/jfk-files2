  "summary_one_paragraph": "In a report dated July 18, 1978, the CIA informs the FBI about Carlos Miguel KASSEL (alias GACEL), a Soviet agent who traveled to Miami in August 1974 to gather intelligence on Cuban exile groups. KASSEL, posing as an \"Asistente Internacional\" for a Colombian workers' union, met with key figures like Ignacio LEDON Iglesias, Mario RIVADULLA, Rolando MASFERRER, and others, assessing their political positions, fundraising efforts, and plans to overthrow Castro. KASSEL reported on the disintegration of the PRP, MASFERRER's call for paramilitary training, and the formation of the MIRC, all while drafting a report for his Soviet contact that downplayed U.S. government support for the exiles.",
