  "summary_one_paragraph": "This SECRET cable, dated September 14, 1995, from the CIA's Sao Paulo station to the Director and Brasilia, reports on a JFK assassination seminar in Rio de Janeiro attended by agent TZKILT/79. The seminar, which drew a small audience, featured a video entitled 'ZR - The Rifle That Killed Kennedy' by Claudia Furiati and Nei Sroulevich. The cable notes the video's convincing nature and its biased presentation of facts, interspersing interviews with officials, including a former DCI made to look dishonest, to promote the Cuban narrative that Lee Harvey Oswald was a tool of the Cuban exile community and NWBOLTON, who sought to eliminate President Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs failure. The cable requests Headquarters pick up a copy of the video and book being hand-carried by Carla B. Ready.",
