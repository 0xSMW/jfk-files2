  "security": "Disclosing that the CIA attempts to assess and analyze information from sources of questionable reliability about the OSWALD case could damage the CIA's reputation. Revealing details about how the CIA uses sources like 'RIMA SHURAKOVA' and their interactions ('visible reaction when seeing OSWALD display') could expose intelligence-gathering methods.",

  "summary": "Kes. Rocca brought to the author's attention an aspect of Nosalisa information that needs to be thoroughly examined when assessing a story about the OSWALD case, as Rocca finds gaps and untruths in the information.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "On July 29, 1968, a memorandum for the record indicates that Kes. Rocca of C/CI/RTA alerted the author to an aspect of Nosalisa information regarding the OSWALD case that needs careful examination. Rocca, upon reading about OSWALD, expressed concerns about gaps and inaccuracies in the information. The memo also discusses RIMA SHURAKOVA, who interacted with a British-controlled source and visited a museum where she had a noticeable reaction to the OSWALD display, suggesting suspicion; however, there are concerns that efforts are being made to portray SHURAKOVA as more credible than she may be.",
