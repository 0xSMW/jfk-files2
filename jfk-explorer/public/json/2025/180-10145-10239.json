The mention of specific individuals involved in these communications also presents a risk of exposing their identities and activities. Directly quoting the messages: \"NEF told MO to fold tre lure\", \"Did you recover the suitcase?\", \"I'm sorry but d've just made plass for arorrer trip and dim leaving His very day.\" These examples, though vague, highlight the potential compromise if interception methods or individual connections were revealed.",
