  "security": "This document outlines the reorganization of the Operations Directorate staff structure. Revealing these internal structural changes could potentially expose intelligence methods, operational priorities, and resource allocations. This is especially relevant because it covers functional divisions. For example, detailing the functions of the Covert Action Staff regarding \"issuance of propaganda guidances and related background\" could compromise ongoing operations or future strategic planning. Additionally, revealing responsibilities of the International Activities Staff in monitoring activities of organizations like \"the United Nations and its specialized agencies\" and \"the international staff of Communist parties\" might create diplomatic tensions or damage relationships.",
