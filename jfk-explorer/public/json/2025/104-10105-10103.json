  "security": "This document discusses sensitive CIA operational methods and personnel, including deep cover personnel, laundering of salaries, cover training establishments (Camp Peary), and the CIA/State ground rule about informing ambassadors about deep cover officers. The document also mentions a potential source that could be endangered if a passage is not modified. The discussion of a terrorist kidnapping in the Dominican Republic reveals operational details that, if published, could endanger individuals and relationships. Specifically, 'Revelation of details of a (joint operation) by a former division chief might lead the increasingly friendly liaison contacts to wonder whether we can maintain confidence on future operations and thereby throw the new relationship into jeopardy.' Also, 'Although the bugging of the thermos was discovered and appeared in the press, the use of the Coca Cola case was not exposed and therefore continues to be an operational possibility, at least as far as the Dominican Republic is concerned.'",
