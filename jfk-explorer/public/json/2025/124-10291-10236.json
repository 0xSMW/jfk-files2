  "summary_one_paragraph": "This CIA telegram, dated October 24, 1961, relays information from a British source about Manolo Ray, a leader of the Cuban exile group Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP). Ray stated that he opposed an invasion of Cuba, believing Castro's overthrow should come from internal resistance, which he claimed had substantial support across Cuban society. Ray indicated that the MRP needed funds and trained exiles, particularly communication experts, but had not received help from U.S. sources supporting invasion efforts. He expressed contempt for efforts to promote a Cuban government in exile, predicted Castro's downfall within a year, and warned of potential civil war in Cuba following Castro's ouster.",
