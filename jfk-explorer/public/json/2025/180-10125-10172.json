  "security": "This file contains sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, places of birth, and Social Security numbers of HSCA staff and applicants. Releasing this information could lead to identity theft or other privacy violations. Additionally, the mention of a security violation case involving a CIA employee, not logged into the HSCA system, reveals a potential compromise of internal security protocols and cooperation between the HSCA and CIA. Disclosing such incidents could undermine trust and damage relationships with other agencies. Quoting directly: 'This file is of an unusual nature because it deals with an incident involving a CIA employee and this committee. It has not been logged into our system by agreement with the CIA.'",
