Ly, who was previously imprisoned following the attempted coup of 1960, indicated that certain generals consulted him about a potential coup to prevent the country from falling to Vietnamese Communists. While agreeing in principle, Ly expressed concern over the methods and consequences, emphasizing the need to avoid bloodshed and minimize the force used to prevent exploitation by the Viet Cong. Ly suggested declaring a state of siege, controlling troop movements, and forming a Revolutionary Committee with technical advisors to manage the government temporarily, allowing the people to choose a head of state.",
