  "summary_one_paragraph": "This secret memorandum, dated December 7, 1995, from Eric L. Qualkenbush, Chief of the Office of Central Cover, to the JFK Assassination Records Review Board, expresses strong objections to the release of CIA personnel names currently or formerly under cover. Qualkenbush argues this would violate secrecy agreements, endanger individuals and their second careers, compromise other employees and sources, and jeopardize relationships with cover providers like the Department of State and private sector entities, potentially paralyzing Agency operations and damaging national security; he proposes using pseudonyms or generic job descriptions instead of true names.",
