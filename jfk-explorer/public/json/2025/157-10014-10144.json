  "security": "Disclosing details about proprietary companies, their financial arrangements, and relationships with outside agencies (like the IRS) could compromise ongoing intelligence operations and expose sensitive methods. For example, the document states: \"Close coordination is maintained with the Internal Revenue Service, which is aware of the Agency's use of proprietary commercial entities. In the event an Agency entity is singled out for IRS audit, it has been agreed that the Agency, through the Office of General Counsel, will notify IRS of Agency ownership. The IRS then cancels the audit in order to conserve auditor manpower.\" This reveals a specific agreement that could be considered preferential treatment and could damage the CIA's reputation.",
