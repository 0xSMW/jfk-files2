  "security": "Disclosing the ongoing investigative details, such as the specific individuals being monitored, the methods of investigation (e.g., toll record analysis, surveillance), and the sources of information (e.g., confidential informants, police departments in other jurisdictions), could compromise the integrity of the investigation and endanger individuals involved. Mention of organized crime figures and their connections could also pose risks to potential witnesses or informants. For example, revealing that ‘Reliable source will secure any tag numbers visiting Archwood Way address on 08-08, 08-09 and 08-10’ indicates active surveillance which, if exposed, could be thwarted or could endanger the source.",
