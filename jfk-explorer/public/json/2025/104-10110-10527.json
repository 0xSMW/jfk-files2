James Comion requested data from the Office of Security about the MDC and Laureano BATESTI falla to assess whether Kiraly should meet with a representative of the MDC to determine if Kiraly could assist the group. A review of security records indicated the MDC was an Anti-Castro group and BATESTI falla had been of interest to the Agency under an Operational Approval in 1960.",
