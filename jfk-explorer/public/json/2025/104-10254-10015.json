The memo indicates that the organization forwarded a letter to Bela Kiraly of the Hungarian Freedom Fighters Inc., a CA-sponsored entity. James Condon of CA/1 requested Office of Security data on the Subject Organization and the letter's author. The memo also notes that CA was considering allowing Kiraly to meet with a representative of the organization to assess whether Kiraly could assist the group, pending a review of security records which showed the letter writer was of previous Agency interest under an Operational Approval in 1960.",
