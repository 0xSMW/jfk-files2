  "security": "This memorandum outlines specific tasks assigned to the CIA within the Cuba Project, including plans for sabotage, propaganda, and infiltration. Disclosing these activities could compromise ongoing or future operations, reveal sensitive intelligence-gathering methods, and damage relationships with other countries. Examples include the disruption of Cuban nickel supplies to the USSR by sinking ships or sabotaging plants, inducing crop failure by infiltrating agents, and conducting propaganda operations in various Latin American countries. As quoted: 'Primary methods of disrupting the supply of Cuban nickel to the USSR could, if approved, include (1) the sinking of Cuban or Bloc ships by open attack; (2) the use of \"frogman\" or UDT tactics in harbors for the same purposeâ€¦' and 'Plans for inducing the failure of crops will be submitted by 15 February. These plans will envisage both the use of controlled assets who can be infiltrated and exfiltrated and the provision of encouragement and guidance to the resistance...'",
