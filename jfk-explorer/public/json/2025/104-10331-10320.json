  "summary_one_paragraph": "On November 9, 1995, Frank S. Most (CSI/HRG) composed a memo for the record detailing his investigation into a discrepancy regarding OCA Job No. 80T01614R. Dee Werbrich (OCA) contacted Most about boxes 1 & 2 of the job, which lacked a shelf list. Through investigation and consultation with Norita of the History Staff, it was determined that the microfilm reels from the missing boxes were actually located in JFK box 64 of Job No. 80T01357A. Russ Holmes (IMS) had previously transferred the boxes to HRG under Most's name. Most confirmed this with Werbrich, who will update OCA's records accordingly.",
