  "summary": "The Kingston station relays its assessment of the Jamaican political climate regarding the establishment of an AMBUD delegation, advising against overt involvement due to potential negative consequences for covert cooperation and relations with the Jamaican government.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "In a classified message dated October 10, 1962, the Kingston station, under Reiling, informs the Director about its assessment of the Jamaican political climate concerning the proposed AMBUD delegation. The COS (Chief of Station) believes the Jamaican government prefers not to be overtly involved in the Cold War and fears jeopardizing the large Jamaican community in Cuba; thus, any attempt to involve the government against its will would damage current and future cooperation, particularly with the RUABBE service. The station reluctantly suggests that if a visit is deemed necessary, it should occur discreetly with Frank (DIAT) Silveira during the Caribbean Games, but insists on no public announcements preceding the Jamaican government's decision, as a rejection following publicity would bolster Cuban influence and local communist and Rastafarian groups, harming U.S. interests.",
