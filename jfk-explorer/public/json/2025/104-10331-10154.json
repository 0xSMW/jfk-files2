  "security": "Releasing CIA employee names, even those with marginal connection to the JFK assassination, has the potential to do unacceptable harm to US national security. The concern is that the damage cannot be measured due to the ripple effect among assets, liaison services, and cover entities. As the memo states: “There is simply no way to measure the possible effect of such a release on past and future employees, agents, liaison relationships and operations.”",

  "summary": "This memo discusses concerns about the release of CIA employees' names in JFK records and recommends revisiting the issue with the ARRB to protect the identities of employees with little to no connection to the JFK assassination story.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "In a memo dated March 5, 1997, Barry Harrelson, JFK Project Officer, expresses concern to Fred Wickham and Linda Cipriani regarding the potential release of CIA employees' names in JFK records. Harrelson reports that the large number of names scheduled for review in May 1997 could harm national security, and recommends engaging upper management to prepare a proposal for the ARRB. The proposal would aim to protect names of employees with limited connection to the JFK assassination, while focusing on those directly involved in the JFK story, in order to balance public interest with the Agency's need to maintain essential security practices.",
