  "security": "Revealing details about the recruitment, assessment, and critiquing of JMPALM assets, including their real names and contacts, and operational methods such as the use of exile front groups, could expose intelligence sources, compromise ongoing operations, and provide adversaries with insights into CIA recruitment and operational tactics. For example: 'As in other newly recruited JMPALM assets, the agent was regularly critiqued as to the value of his information and was provided with regular guidance in order to better strengthen his value to JMPALM' and 'Identity uses several exile front groups as cover for his meetings with his Miami contacts'. Disclosing Identity's contacts could also lead to those individuals being targeted or compromised.",

  "summary": "A progress report on 'Identity,' a JMPALM asset, covering November and December 1963, detailing his training, contacts within Dominican and Haitian exile communities, and intelligence contributions, including reports on political activities and coup plans.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "This secret dispatch provides a progress report on 'Identity' (Pedro Valdivia), a JMPALM asset, during November and December 1963. It details his initial contact by a JMPALM Case officer, subsequent training sessions with JMPALM-2, and regular critique on the value of his information. 'Identity' maintained contact with individuals like Dominican Air Force Colonel Pedro, Cuban navy veteran Antonio ALLANO Montem, retired Dominica Army Colonel Fernando CARTAGENA, and Haitian exile Edward DENIS. He used exile front groups as cover and provided intelligence reports on Dominican and Venezuelan political and military activities. The agent was paid $175 in November and $200 in December, plus a $25 Christmas bonus. Future plans included further evaluation and transfer to AGROTHY-1 for permanent handling after undergoing training by AMPAL-1.",
