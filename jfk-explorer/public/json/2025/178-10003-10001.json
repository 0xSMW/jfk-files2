  "security": "Discussion of FIRE FLY use over Kamchatka was disapproved, but there was enthusiastic discussion of its use against Cuba. State Department is anxious that exiles conduct the balloon operation over Cuba. CLA is to include the requirement for an overflight to gather radar information for the North Vietnam plan. State seems determined to have no overflights over Laos and no involvement of Chinese Nationalist aircraft or personnel except possibly Chinese pilots in sterile aircraft with South Vietnam credentials. Secretary Rusk is absolutely firm on getting the Indians cranked into the Tibet operation. These details could highlight ongoing or planned clandestine operations, potentially compromising the safety and success of such activities. Additionally, the document contains sensitive information on operational planning and involvement, like the \"Air Libya item was approved as presented,\" could reveal intelligence-gathering methods and priorities, which could damage national security.",
