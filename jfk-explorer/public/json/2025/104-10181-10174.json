  "security": "Revealing the operational contact between the CIA and individuals like William Gaudet can expose past intelligence gathering methods and compromise current or potential sources. For instance, disclosing that 'GAUDET WAS A CONTACT OF DCD FROM 1948 UNTIL NOVEMBER 1961 IN NEW ORLEANS AREA' details a specific period of engagement and type of relationship, which could reveal operational patterns. Furthermore, stating that Gaudet 'HAS EXAGGERATED HIS ROLE WITH THE AGENCY' indicates internal awareness of potential misinformation, which could be sensitive in public disclosures.",
  "security_level": "SECRET",
  "summary": "A CIA cable provides headquarters traces on William Gaudet and Antonio Veciana, who were mentioned in a previous London dispatch, including Gaudet's past contact with DCD and Veciana's biographical information.",
