  "security": "The documents discuss ongoing interactions between the CIA and the ARRB regarding sensitive information related to the JFK assassination. Revealing these exchanges could expose the CIA's internal processes for handling such requests and potentially highlight areas of contention or disagreement, as demonstrated by ARRB's repeated follow-ups on unanswered requests. The memorandum from December 18, 1997 underscores the seriousness of the situation: “I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for additional information and records...On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers.”",
