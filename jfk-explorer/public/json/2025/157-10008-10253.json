  "summary_one_paragraph": "This memorandum, related to \"Book V\" of the Church Committee report, discusses the CIA's 1965 interrogation of Tepedino, a New York jeweler involved in the AMLASH operation, where Tepedino was found to be deceptive about AMLASH's ties to Cuban intelligence and AMLASH's denial of plans to overthrow Castro. It also highlights that, following President Kennedy's assassination, Mexico City cabled AMLASH's name (Rolando Cubela) as a contact of Soviet personnel, yet key figures like Fitzgerald, Helms, Tom K, and Angleton did not inform the desk officer, John Whitten, of the significance of AMLASH's name.",
