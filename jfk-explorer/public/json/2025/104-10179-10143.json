It also exposes the station's policy of not discouraging certain uses of the channel to maintain its secrecy and effectiveness. Quoting directly: 'HIGH LEVEL GOBERNACION OFFICIALS SOMETIMES KNOWINGLY USE LITEMPO VISA CHANNEL THEMSELVES FOR 'PERSONAL INTEREST CASES'...STATION HAS NOT DISCOURAGED SUCH USE OF THE CHANNEL BECAUSE IT TENDS TO HELP EVERYONE WHO [IN ACT] TO KEEP MOUTHS SHUT AND TO KEEP CHANNEL FROM BEING BRANDED AS EXCLUSIVELY [ODYOKE].'",

  "summary": "A CIA message discusses the difficulties in obtaining a Mexican visa through regular channels and suggests using high-level Mexican contacts or the LITEMPO visa channel for AMBANG-1, while emphasizing the importance of coordinated action between AMBANG-1 and the station.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "This secret CIA message, dated August 19, 1962, from Mexico City, addresses challenges in securing a Mexican visa for AMBANG-1 (likely a code name for an individual or operation). It indicates that obtaining a visa through traditional means (Mexican consulates in Miami or San Juan) is problematic due to bureaucratic delays and concerns about Cubans becoming public charges. The message suggests leveraging high-level Mexican officials or Cuban contacts with such access, potentially utilizing the CIA's LITEMPO visa channel. The station wants AMBANG/1 to try on his own first, and then the station will assist. The message stresses the need for either AMBANG-1 or the station to take the lead, not both simultaneously, to avoid complications. It also touches on the possibility of AMBANG-1 using CINODACID as cover and consulting with the station's ODACID contact in Mexico if needed.",
