The investigation, initiated by Prescott S. Williams of the 771st MI Det, uncovered a Certificate of Birth Registration with the name Adrian Martir born on August 11, 1910, in Utuado, Puerto Rico, to mother Juana Martir-Aponte. Discrepancies in the spelling of the surname and the father's information were noted, alongside a court order from 1963 legally changing the father's name to Manuel Marti. The report also highlights the significance of registering a child's birth outside of the parents with the term, ‘natural child.’",
