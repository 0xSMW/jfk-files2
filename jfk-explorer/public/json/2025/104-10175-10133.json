  "summary_one_paragraph": "The report describes Subject LIHUFF-1's involvement in the recruitment and harassment of Soviet official ABCDET, based on a narrative provided by Keith Cameron Johnson, Dean of Men at the University of the Americas. Johnson, who rented his house from LIHUFF-1, recounted an incident where he observed suspicious individuals around his property, possibly connected to the Soviet official's case. This involved strange men appearing at Johnson's house, attempted break-ins, and interactions with local law enforcement, which led Johnson to believe he was under surveillance, all potentially exposing the Station's connection to LIHUFF-1 if the Soviets suspected any link.",
