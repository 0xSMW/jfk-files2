The assets reported the return of a former Russian Embassy official, ((SHULIPIN)), noting his unchanged rank and duties as strange, and confirmed ((ZHILTSOV))'s continued absence. The C/O collected photos and KDPEEK comments, issued a CD for KDPEEK, paid salaries to KDHUSTLE/18 and KDHUSTLE/31, and inquired about CISN's decision to discontinue providing KDPEEK photo negatives. The C/O also warned the assets of potential pretext knocks at KDPEEK's door due to the recently released JFK assassination report, arranging for D/11 to pose as a housewife if needed. Finally, the report details the C/O’s security measures during transit and plans to inquire about CISN’s decision.",
