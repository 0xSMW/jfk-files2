  "security": "Disclosing the assessment techniques used on Acevedo and the stationâ€™s suspicions could compromise ongoing intelligence operations and potentially endanger the source (VPJAUNTY/1). For instance, mentioning, \"It is possible then that a security official insisted that ACEVEDO confirm his version of the CONTACT with the source of the contact, J/1\" reveals speculation that can disrupt Cuban intelligence operations. Also quoting \"STATION WOULD NOT GET FAR WITH HIM USING OFFICIAL AMERICANS. HE SAID HOWEVER, THAT A SOUTH AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN INTERESTED IN TRADE IN CUBA (SPECIFICALLY IMPORT/EXPORT) WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO ACEVEDO\", directly indicates a specific means of approach.",

  "summary": "A cable discusses the continued contact between VPJAUNTY/1 and Cuban Charge Carlos Acevedo, analyzing Acevedo's behavior and suggesting potential methods for further engagement while assessing the security implications of their interactions.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "This secret cable outlines the ongoing interactions between VPJAUNTY/1 and Carlos Acevedo, the Cuban Charge, focusing on Acevedo's potential testing of VPJAUNTY/1 and his expressed interest in business opportunities. The cable analyzes Acevedo's behavior during a dinner where he probed VPJAUNTY/1 about past contacts and his views on U.S.-Cuba relations. The station assesses that Acevedo may be reporting these contacts and suggests using a South American businessman as an intermediary to further engage Acevedo's interest in leaving government for business. It also requests headquarters' comments on the events and suggestions prior to a scheduled meeting.",
