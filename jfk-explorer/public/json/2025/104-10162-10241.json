Quoting directly: \"Their present home leave in the USSR would seem to offer a ready-made situation for renewed contact when they return since natural curiosity about their activities and time spent at home could be sufficient grounds for an invitation either to both or singly to spend an evening together. We offer those thoughts only because they appear to us as good opportunities not only to maintain Staffer contact with a target of priority interest, but to also develop this contact further te the degree of intimacy needed for a recognition and ultimatic exploitation of his susceptibilities.\" Such information, if exposed, could be exploited by hostile intelligence services to compromise or manipulate the individuals involved.",
