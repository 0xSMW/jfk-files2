  "summary": "An FBI report detailing the Cuban Revolutionary Council's reaction to perceived changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba, including Dr. Jose Miro Cardona's potential resignation and the growing frustration among Cuban exiles.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "This FBI report, dated April 16, 1963, from the Miami field office, outlines the internal dynamics of the Cuban Revolutionary Council in response to perceived shifts in U.S. policy toward Cuba. It details Dr. Jose Miro Cardona's initial offer to resign as head of the Council due to his belief that the U.S. lacks a concrete plan to liberate Cuba and favors peaceful co-existence with the Castro regime. While the Council initially rejected Cardonaâ€™s resignation, they expressed a serious crisis in relations with the U.S., affirming their commitment to continue the fight against the Soviet-Castro regime and appealing for continued American support, and frustration among the Cuban exiles due to the perception of abandonment by the United States.",
