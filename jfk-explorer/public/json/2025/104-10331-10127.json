Wickham, Jr., from the DO, informs the Chief of the Historical Review Group that the DO strongly objects to the ARRB releasing the phrase 'a good KUBARK asset' regarding ERTHYROID/3, a Nicaraguan asset used in Mexico City to interrogate Alvarado during the Samoza regime; the concern is that this phrase would expose ERTHYROID/3 as a unilateral source for the CIA, unbeknownst to Nicaraguan and Mexican services, thus endangering the asset and potentially compromising other recruited officers in liaison services by causing them to reconsider their relationships with the CIA.",
