Swenson, Chief of WH/SA/CI, explains that the apartment was deemed unsuitable due to its prior exposure to several KUBARK staffers and agent assets, including Mr. Dolf Luim with AMDIXIE-1, Mr. (Mike Kline) with AMTOUT, (Horace Speed) with AMCASH, and Lou De Santi with AMNIP-1 and Dr. Winston. As a result, a request has been made to secure an alternative apartment for AMMUG-1.",
