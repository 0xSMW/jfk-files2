  "security": "Several documents discuss the protection of cryptonyms, pseudonyms, cable numbers, file numbers, and employee names. For example, a memo discusses the release of the IJDECANTER cryptonym, arguing it \"would provide an identifiable benefit to the Russian counterintelligence effort and concomitant damage to US intelligence interests.\" It suggests substituting a fictitious cryptonym instead. Another memo details that the release of file numbers would reveal the methodology by which we file/store and retrieve information. which is still in practice today and thus we cannot approve it on a blanket basis.",
