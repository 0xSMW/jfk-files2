Exposing methods used to gather intelligence, such as photographing subjects and arranging meetings with foreign leaders, could damage the CIAâ€™s reputation and ability to conduct covert operations. Furthermore, discussing the monitoring of mail and providing female companions for foreign leaders could be seen as controversial and damaging to the agency's integrity.",
