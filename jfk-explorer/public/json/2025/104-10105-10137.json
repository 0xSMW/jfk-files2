Phillips to determine if it contains classified information or material not in the public domain.

  "summary_one_paragraph": "J.F. Meehan from C/EAB is coordinating a review of a manuscript submitted by retired CIA employee David A. Phillips, focusing on three chapters of a book he is preparing. The review, involving LA Div., CI Staff, CCS, DDO/SS/SOG, and DDO/SSU, aims to determine if the manuscript contains classified information, information learned during Phillips' employment, or information not already in the public domain. A key point of concern is Phillips' potential confirmation of Camp Perry as a CIA training installation, which CCS recommends be deleted to avoid official acknowledgment of the site's CIA affiliation.",
