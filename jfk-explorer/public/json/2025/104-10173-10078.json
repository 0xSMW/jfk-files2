  "security": "Revealing operational details, such as meeting locations (Sands Hotel, Miami Beach), code names (William Cline, BETO), communication methods (KEYWAY sterile phone number, OTPs concealed in a shaving kit), and planned meetings in Mexico City, could jeopardize the agent, compromise communication channels, and expose operational tactics. Explicit instructions to VASLOUCH/2, such as to 'react with disbelief combined with Indignation if a recruitment pitch was made' and to discourage social contact with the LOGUINOVs, clearly demonstrate methods used to maintain the agent's cover and to potentially misinform hostile intelligence services. The document also reveals the agent's concerns about her daughter's associations, particularly with an ODACID officer, which is considered sensitive. Quoting directly: 'instructed V/2 to tighten up on their security citing the dangers of audio-surveillance and the necessity for great care when mailing the letters out' and 'KUBARK security in dealing with her case was emphasized'.",
