  "security": "Revealing the identities of individuals suspected of being CIA assets and discussing the possibility that a defector was provided with a list of these assets by a foreign intelligence service could jeopardize these individuals and compromise intelligence operations. For example, the memo states, \"It seems likely that DE ARMAS was provided a list of known or suspected Agency assets by the DGI as part of Cuba's ongoing anti-CIA, anti-U. S. Government campaign designed to offset adverse criticism to Cuba's military assistance to Angola.\"",

  "summary": "A memorandum from the Security Analysis Group concerning Manuel L. DE ARMAS, who defected to Cuba and claimed to be an ex-CIA agent, potentially exposing former WH Division assets and alleging CIA operations.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "This memorandum, dated 23 June 1976, from Michael E. Schneeberger of the Security Analysis Group, addresses the defection of Manuel L. DE ARMAS to Cuba in April 1976, where he claimed to be a former CIA agent. The memo analyzes DE ARMAS' allegations made in a Havana press conference regarding purported CIA operations and identifies individuals he claimed were Agency operatives or assets, checking these names against Office of Security indices. While DE ARMAS did not identify any bona fide Agency staff employees or agents, some individuals he named were potentially identifiable as former WH Division assets. The memo suggests DE ARMAS may have been provided a list of suspected Agency assets by Cuban intelligence (DGI) as part of an anti-CIA campaign, and concludes that no further action is necessary as no current Agency operations appear to have been exposed or threatened.",
