Barker could expose them to harm or compromise their ongoing or future operations. For example, Barker's \"puppy-dog loyalty to his case officers and to the Agency\" and his \"lack of discretion\" combined with being known as an 'American' would reveal a great deal about his suitability as an asset. Similarly, highlighting Guetegui's close relationship with PAN-2 and his dedication could endanger him.",
