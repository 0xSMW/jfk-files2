  "security": "Revealing details about how the CIA interacted with the Warren Commission staff could compromise the CIA's methods of providing information and managing perceptions during the investigation. For instance, the memo states, 'Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sending parts of his report dealing with the Soviet intelligence services to CIA for checking as to their accuracy.' This type of interaction could raise questions about the independence of the Commission’s findings and the CIA’s influence.",

The discussion focused on Soviet emigration policies for citizens married to foreign nationals, the timing of their departures, and the visa application process.

Slawson also mentioned sending parts of his report on Soviet intelligence services to the CIA for accuracy checks.",
