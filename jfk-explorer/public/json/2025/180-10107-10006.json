Atzenhoffer remembered Oswald being a quiet member of the CAPC and recalled Ed Voebel being close to Oswald. He also mentioned David Ferrie teaching courses at Moisant Squadron and his first plane flight with Ferrie, as well as attending a party at either Ferrie's or Col. Jim Salmon's house. Atzenhoffer was shown a photo book and identified Clay Shaw and Melvin \"Pinky\" Seeling. He remembered Seeling from the CAPC or other mutual friends, noting Seeling's father owned a dairy farm and that Seeling was stationed in Corpus Christi, Texas in the Air Force. A check of New Orleans PD files indicated that Seeling had been arrested in 1961.",
