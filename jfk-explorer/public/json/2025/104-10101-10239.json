The message outlines how FBIS (Foreign Broadcast Information Service) sources plan to leverage the incident to highlight alleged racist attitudes in the Soviet Union, link it to the Congo expulsion of Soviet diplomats, and portray it as part of a broader Soviet scheme to subvert and control naive African states through indoctrination, economic aid, and political manipulation. The message directs recipients to watch student groups for demonstrations and interview communist-trained students and government officials for reaction, with instructions to send relevant clippings to HQS.",
