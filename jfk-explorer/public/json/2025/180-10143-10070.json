  "security": "Revealing details about how the CIA manages and protects sensitive information could compromise ongoing operations and reveal intelligence-gathering methods. For instance, the discussion about ‘sleeper agents’ in Communist China and the handling of defectors exposes potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, disclosing the criteria for opening 201 files and the existence of the ‘Green List check’ and ‘R. list check’ could allow adversaries to circumvent intelligence efforts. Quoting directly: 'True name & cryptonyms are not maintained on the same sheet' and 'Each communication may, in twice, be downgraded; may never be destroyed.'",
