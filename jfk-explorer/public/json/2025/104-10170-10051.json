  "security": "Disclosing details about the AMSPELL program, AMHINT operations, and AMBARB activities could compromise ongoing covert actions and intelligence-gathering efforts. Specifically, the reference to 'increased control' of AMSPELL and establishing 'an acceptable degree of KUBARK control' suggests operational sensitivities and clandestine relationships that could be jeopardized if revealed. Additionally, exposing salary breakdowns and funding allocations for various personnel could damage relationships and expose vulnerabilities within the network. Quoting directly: 'All planning phases of AMSPELL activities supported by JMWAVE...are subject to the results of meetings with AMSPELL concerning increased control, and, the decisions of JMWAVE to continue a support relationship if an acceptable degree of KUBARK control can be established.'",
