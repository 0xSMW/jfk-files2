  "document_type": "Memorandum",
  "security": "This document outlines intelligence assessments and responses to the Soviet military build-up in Cuba, revealing sensitive operational details, intelligence collection methods (such as U-2 overflights), and internal disagreements between agencies like the CIA and DIA regarding the interpretation of intelligence. Sharing these details could compromise intelligence sources and methods, inform adversaries about the US's intelligence capabilities and limitations, and expose internal debates that could be exploited. For instance, the memo discusses the reluctance to authorize U-2 flights due to previous incidents and the resulting decisions to modify flight paths to avoid known SA-2 sites, which could reveal operational constraints. Also, the specific details of NSAM 181's directives to CIA reveal how the executive branch tasked the Agency and made determinations based on Agency intelligence.",
