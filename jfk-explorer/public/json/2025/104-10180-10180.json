Gamberini (C/WH/L/FI) to the Chief of WH/4, assesses the damage to CIA operations resulting from the arrest of ANETE-1, a key agent in Cuba's stay-behind networks. The memo indicates that ANETE-1 had detailed knowledge of agent networks (including AMRIPE-1, AMARCH-1, and others), their contact methods, and cached funds, as well as connections to counter-revolutionaries, potentially compromising these assets and operations. The memo highlights the critical nature of ANETE-1's position and the breadth of sensitive information he possessed, necessitating a realistic appraisal of the operational fallout.",
