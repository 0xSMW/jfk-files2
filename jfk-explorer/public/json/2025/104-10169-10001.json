  "summary_one_paragraph": "This cable, dated March 2, 1978, from the Director to Guayaquil, Miami, and Quito provides HQS traces on Evelio Duque Miyar, a former captain who fought against Batista and later formed an anti-communist organization against Castro. The CIA granted Duque a POA in 1961, contacted and debriefed him, and connected him with JMNAVE to assist his guerrilla fighters in Cuba. However, the POA was cancelled in May 1962 because Duque refused to allow the team to enter Cuba under CIA direction. By 1973, Duque was reportedly involved with drug trafficker Alfredo Ordonez Gonzalez, but a review of his file showed no connection to drug trafficking.",
