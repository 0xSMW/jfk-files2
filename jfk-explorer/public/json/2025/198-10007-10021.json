  "security": "This report details actions taken to combat Castro-Communist subversion, including intelligence gathering, travel control, and propaganda control. Revealing these specific operations, such as monitoring Cuban flights, influencing foreign governments to restrict travel to Cuba, and disseminating counter-propaganda, could compromise ongoing efforts and expose intelligence sources and methods. For example, the report states: 'Developed highly useful information on frequency of Cuban \"chartered\" flights to Brazil, names and nationalities of passengers and crew...Transmitted this information to station chiefs in the Latin American countries...' and 'Instructed Embassy Conakry to try to persuade Guinean authorities to deny use of airport facilities by flights on Habana-Mosco≈≠ route.' Such disclosures could hinder future intelligence gathering and diplomatic efforts.",
