  "security": "Revealing the identities of individuals used in covert operations or providing information to local security services could jeopardize their safety and compromise ongoing intelligence activities. Disclosing agent training details, particularly demolition, could also expose sensitive operational methods. For example, referring to the possible cooperation between Miami exiles and exiles who oppose regime Gen. Torrijos. Quoting from the document: “PEREZ RECRUITED DEC 65 FOR USE AS MILARRON RECRUITER. HE RECEIVED AGENT AND TEAM TRAINING WHICH INCLUDED DEMOLITION.” and “Panamanian Repressive Measures against Cuban Exiles…this attitude is directed primarily against Cuban exiles residing in Miami.”",

  "summary": "This collection of documents from the CIA and FBI focuses on Panamanian measures against Cuban exiles and includes details on individuals potentially involved in covert operations, such as Duney Pio Perez Alamo. It involves name traces, operational interests, and potential risks associated with these individuals, along with FBI requests for information on the same subject.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "This compilation includes a CIA memorandum, a dispatch from Panama City, cable messages, and FBI document extracts, all centered on Panamanian actions against Cuban exiles and various individuals' connections to these events. The CIA memo details the results of tracing names from a prior dispatch, identifying past or present operational interests of subjects like Orlando Garcia Vasquez and Duney Perez Alamo, who was recruited for MILARRON and received demolition training. The dispatch from Panama City reveals that the local security service is becoming increasingly hostile towards Cuban exiles, potentially due to reports of cooperation between Cuban and Panamanian exiles in Miami opposed to General Omar Torrijos. The cable messages include requests for traces on Duney Pio Perez Alamo and information regarding his recruitment and training, highlighting ongoing surveillance and information gathering efforts.",
