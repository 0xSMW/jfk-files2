  "security": "The release of information officially recognizing the fact of state cover will be a delicate issue across the DO. Official confirmation of CIA use of state cover in Argentina will prejudice unilateral officers' cover and activity... would cause damage to Station's relations with our various liaison services... Embassy Buenos Aires is so open a workplace that there is no real cleared access area (CAA). Publication of CIA use of official cover might endanger peoples' lives, specifically Station officers'.",

  "summary": "This cable from Buenos Aires station to the Director discusses the potential damage to CIA operations and relationships with liaison services if the Agency's use of state cover in Argentina is officially recognized, particularly in the context of the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB). It also raises security concerns for station officers due to terrorist infrastructure and potential exploitation by hostile intelligence services.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "In a February 1998 cable from the Buenos Aires station to the CIA Director, the station chief expresses strong concerns about the potential release of information acknowledging the CIA's use of state cover in Argentina, fearing it would jeopardize unilateral officers' cover, damage relationships with liaison services, and compromise sensitive penetrations of the local government. The cable argues that such a release would undermine the trust built with liaison services following President Clinton's visit and a subsequent visit to Headquarters, and it would strain bilateral relations with Argentina, especially given the open environment of the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires. The station also emphasizes the security risk, given the presence of terrorist infrastructure and potential exploitation by hostile entities, which could endanger the lives of station officers.",
