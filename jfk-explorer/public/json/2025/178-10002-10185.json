Murray reports to the Inspector General, via the Deputy Director for Operations, about a 1960 incident involving Jose Raul Martinez Nunez, a Cuban national and Cubana Airline pilot recruited by the CIA. Martinez was scheduled to pilot a flight from Havana to Prague to pick up Raul Castro Ruz and his official party. Headquarters considered the 'possible removal of top three leaders' and instructed the Havana Station to assess Martinez's willingness to arrange an accident during the return trip, offering $10,000 for successful completion, but these instructions were later rescinded. Murray debriefed Martinez, who defected in December 1960, and Murray believes he never informed Martinez of the changed instructions.",
