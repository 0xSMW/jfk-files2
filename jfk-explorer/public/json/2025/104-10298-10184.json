  "summary_one_paragraph": "This SECRET-classified message, dated May 27, discusses a Miami Herald article by James Buchanan reporting that Miro Cardona has been replaced by Manuel Ray as the leader of Cuban exiles, supposedly with the support of the United States. The article implicates Adolf A. Berle Jr. as being involved in a new U.S.-sponsored Cuban effort, causing furor within the local Cuban colony and leading at least one operations agent to request reassignment. The message indicates that the CIA is attempting to trace Buchanan's source for the claim of \"U.S. blessing\" and is considering initiating actions to discredit Buchanan's story and reassure Miro Cardona.",
