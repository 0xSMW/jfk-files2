Quoting directly: 'PERRY was not to disclose his past employment with this Agency...Security, on the basis of the above request by WH Division, contacted the appropriate person in USIA and advised them on a controlled basis of PERRY's former affiliation with this Agency.' and 'The following information concerning American Communists in Mexico and their contacts has been developed.'",
