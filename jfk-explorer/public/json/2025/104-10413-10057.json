  "security": "Revealing that the CIA sought to identify individuals who visited the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City and that the Cuban DGI provided information to the CIA about a KGB officer could damage relationships. Disclosing this collaboration and the identities of the sources could jeopardize their safety and future cooperation with intelligence agencies. Additionally, exposing that individuals were requested to identify photographs from the Warren Commission report could reveal the focus and methods of the CIA's investigation into the JFK assassination.",

The request cited the man's photograph being published in the Warren Commission report and widely distributed by journalists.
