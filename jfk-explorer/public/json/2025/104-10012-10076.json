  "security": "Because this dispatch provides explicit instructions on influencing foreign contacts and assets—such as advising them to refute conspiracy claims without attacking Garrison personally—it reveals internal CIA strategies for responding to political and media controversies. Quoting directly: “If the Garrison investigation should be cited...you may use the article to brief interested contacts...assets may have to explain...Even if your assets have to discuss this...any personal attacks upon Garrison...must be strictly avoided.” Sharing these instructions could highlight CIA involvement in shaping narratives overseas, potentially harming ongoing operations and damaging the CIA’s reputation.",

  "summary_one_paragraph": "This dispatch, signed by Brian R. Slaght of the CIA, forwards a reprint of Edward Jay Epstein’s New Yorker article concerning District Attorney Jim Garrison’s investigation into President Kennedy’s assassination.
