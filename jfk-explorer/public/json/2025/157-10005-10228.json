  "summary": "This document is a transcript of a Senate Select Committee hearing featuring the testimony of E. Howard Hunt concerning his inquiries into the possibility of CIA involvement in assassinations, specifically his contact with Colonel Boris Pash and others regarding the potential liquidation of a suspected double agent.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "On January 10, 1976, E. Howard Hunt testified before the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, detailing his investigation into whether the CIA had personnel capable of carrying out assassinations. Hunt described his approach to Colonel Boris Pash, who he believed headed a unit specializing in \"wet affairs\" (assassinations, kidnappings), to explore the possibility of liquidating a suspected double agent in the Albanian branch, although the plan never materialized. The testimony identifies several individuals who may have been aware of Pash's alleged capabilities, organizational structures within the CIA related to these matters, and the context of Huntâ€™s inquiries within the broader political and psychological operations of the agency.",
