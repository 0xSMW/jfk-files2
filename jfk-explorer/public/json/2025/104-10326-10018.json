This request stems from the JFK Assassination Records Review Board's responsibility to release all records related to President Kennedy's assassination, with limited exceptions. The board is pressing the Agency to justify withholding information about State cover, despite its widespread discussion in the public media, focusing on the harm to current diplomatic interests and potential operational interference in the specified countries.",
