  "security": "The summary reveals specific details about CIA-FBI relationships, including instances where the CIA was permitted to recruit foreigners in the U.S. if they immediately contacted the FBI and furnished information. Quoting: 'It was therefore agreed between the CIA and the FBI that CIA could continue to recruit foreigners in the United States if they would immediately contact the FBI upon recruiting an individual and furnish Papich with all information obtained from that individual which pertained to internal affairs.' Sharing these inter-agency agreements could compromise operational methods and relationships.",

  "summary_one_paragraph": "This is a summary of an interview with Sam J. Papich, conducted on March 5, 1975, focusing on his experiences as a liaison between the FBI and CIA, particularly his relationships with J. Edgar Hoover and Jim Angleton. Papich describes a positive interagency dynamic in the early 1960s that deteriorated during the Johnson Administration due to Hoover's reluctance to engage in extensive counterintelligence work. The summary recounts Papich's attempts to promote joint CIA-FBI operations, Hoover's rejection of these proposals, and the resulting strained relationship, culminating in Papich's resignation in 1970 after failing to bridge the gap between the two agencies regarding counterintelligence strategies.",
