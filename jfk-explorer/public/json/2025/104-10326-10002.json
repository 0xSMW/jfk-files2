  "summary_one_paragraph": "A secret cable from CIA headquarters (EUR/NG) to the Immediate London station, dated July 27, 1998, addresses the potential declassification of a British Security Service (BSS) document related to a 1963 interview with Lillian Sloboda, wife of a Soviet defector, Vladimir O. Sloboda. The JFK Assassination Review Board is interested in this document (CSCI-3/778,353) because it concerns defectors to the USSR around the time of Oswald and the Kennedy assassination. The CIA is seeking BSS input on proposed redactions of references to BSS, CIA, and FBI before the document is released to the Review Board by the end of the week, emphasizing the need for a response by July 30 to allow time for discussions.",
