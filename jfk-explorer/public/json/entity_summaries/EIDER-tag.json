  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, 'EIDER' appears to be a tag associated with documents related to intelligence gathering and analysis of Soviet air defense systems during the Cold War. The documents describe missions penetrating the Soviet Bloc air defense system in June-July 1956, analyzing Soviet radar coverage, counteractions, and the effectiveness of their warning system based on COMINT and ELINT data. One document also mentions a request from the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) for information on the U-2 Project, specifically Detachment C stationed in Atsugi, Japan, and Soviet knowledge of the program. The connection to the JFK assassination context is indirect, arising from the HSCA's inquiry into the U-2 program, potentially indicating an investigation into intelligence activities or capabilities relevant to the assassination.",
