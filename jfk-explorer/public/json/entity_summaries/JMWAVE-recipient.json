  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, JMWAVE appears to be a recipient of various communications, including messages and cables. The documents do not explicitly define what JMWAVE is, but the context suggests it is likely a CIA station or unit, given the nature of the communications it receives. The documents mention topics such as the Inter-University Committee for Political and Social Action (ICPSA), trust accounts related to Brigade 2506 members, and travel arrangements for individuals like Alexander Shatton. However, the documents do not provide enough information to determine JMWAVE's specific role or significance in the JFK assassination context. The documents span from 1963 to 1968, indicating JMWAVE's involvement in various operations during this period.",
