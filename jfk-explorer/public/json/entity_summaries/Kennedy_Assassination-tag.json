They include daily summaries reporting on reactions to the assassination from various countries, particularly Cuba and the Soviet Bloc, as well as internal assessments of potential involvement by groups like the DRE.

The documents also show the CIA's concern about the potential exposure of personnel and operations related to the assassination, as well as efforts to manage the release of information to the public.",
