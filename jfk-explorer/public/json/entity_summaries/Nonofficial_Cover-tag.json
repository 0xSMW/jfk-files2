  "summary": "Nonofficial cover refers to a method of concealing the true affiliation or purpose of individuals or organizations, often used by intelligence agencies like the CIA. The documents suggest that nonofficial cover was utilized for various purposes, including providing cover for CIA operations overseas, assessing potential REDSKIN agents, and protecting agent assets. The CIA explored using companies like The Wackenhut Corporation for cover support. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) showed interest in nonofficial cover officers and agent assets, indicating its relevance to investigations related to the JFK assassination. The use of nonofficial cover allowed the CIA to operate with a degree of secrecy and deniability.",

The use of nonofficial cover could obscure the true nature and extent of any involvement by intelligence agencies or related entities.",
