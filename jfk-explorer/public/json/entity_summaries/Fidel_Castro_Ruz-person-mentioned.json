  "summary": "Fidel Castro Ruz is mentioned in four documents within this collection. The documents primarily focus on Cuban affairs during the 1960s and later in the 1990s. One document details the Cuban media's reaction to Martin Luther King's assassination. Two documents concern the expulsion of a Spanish counselor from Havana for alleged espionage and counterrevolutionary activities. The final document, dated December 1993, relays intelligence from SWRACK transcripts, mentioning Castro's dissatisfaction and a Cuban official's claim of possessing information related to the Kennedy assassination. The documents suggest Castro's leadership was a focal point of international interest and scrutiny, particularly concerning espionage and political stability in Cuba.",
