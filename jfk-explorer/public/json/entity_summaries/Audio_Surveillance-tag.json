  "summary": "Audio surveillance, as depicted in the documents, refers to the covert monitoring of individuals or locations through electronic listening devices. The documents highlight instances of audio surveillance conducted by the CIA, including operations targeting Manuel F. ARTIME Buesa, a Cuban exile leader, and the New China News Agency in Havana. These operations involved installing microphones and telephone taps at safehouses and leased apartments to gather intelligence. The documents also mention David L. Christ's pioneering work in audio surveillance technology for the CIA. The operations varied in duration and success, with one operation (STESCALADE) being compromised and leading to the capture of technicians.",
