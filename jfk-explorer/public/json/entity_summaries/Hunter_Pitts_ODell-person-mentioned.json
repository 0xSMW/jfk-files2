  "summary": "Hunter Pitts O'Dell is mentioned in documents related to investigations into Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison. The documents primarily consist of memoranda and testimonies from Alan G. Sentinella before the Senate Select Committee (SSC) in 1975. These documents focus on FBI investigations into King's alleged communist ties and the role of Stanley Levison. O'Dell's significance arises from his potential association with individuals or organizations under scrutiny for communist affiliations during the Cold War era, as investigated by the FBI and later reviewed by the SSC. The documents do not directly implicate O'Dell in the JFK assassination but rather place him within the context of broader investigations into political and social movements of the time.",
