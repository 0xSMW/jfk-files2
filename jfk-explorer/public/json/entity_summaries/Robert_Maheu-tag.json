  "significance": "While the documents detail Maheu's involvement in CIA operations against Fidel Castro, his direct connection to the JFK assassination is not explicitly stated. However, his association with plots against Castro, which were a potential motive for the assassination, and his involvement with individuals connected to organized crime, which has also been theorized as a potential factor in the assassination, make him a person of interest in the broader context of the JFK assassination.",
