  "summary": "The Warren Commission, officially known as the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, was established to investigate the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963. The CIA documents reveal the agency's extensive involvement in providing information and assistance to the Commission. The documents cover a range of topics, including Lee Harvey Oswald's activities and contacts in the US, the Soviet Union, and Mexico City, as well as the CIA's efforts to address conspiracy theories and counter foreign interest in the assassination. The CIA also reviewed Warren Commission documents for declassification, balancing transparency with the protection of intelligence sources and methods. The documents also reveal concerns from foreign intelligence agencies, such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), regarding the declassification of certain Warren Commission documents. The CIA's interactions with the Warren Commission spanned from the initial investigation in 1964 through subsequent inquiries, such as those by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA).",
