  "summary": "The National Security Agency (NSA) is a U.S. intelligence agency that played a role in providing information and materials to congressional committees investigating the JFK assassination. The NSA provided materials to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) related to Cuban intelligence networks and signals intelligence. The NSA reviewed its holdings and concluded that no intelligence material revealed Cuban involvement in the assassination. The NSA also classified portions of reports related to interviews conducted during the investigation due to sensitive communications intelligence information.",
