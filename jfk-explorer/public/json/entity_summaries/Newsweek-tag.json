  "summary": "Newsweek is a news magazine that appears in multiple documents related to CIA activities and the JFK assassination. The documents reveal that Newsweek was preparing a story on the U.S. intelligence community in 1971, prompting the CIA to issue guidance to its field offices on how to respond to inquiries from Newsweek reporters, emphasizing the need to protect sensitive operational details and personnel information. A Newsweek correspondent, Robert J. KORENGOLD, is mentioned in a 1972 memo detailing his past assignments and interactions. Additionally, Newsweek is indirectly connected to the JFK assassination through a memorandum detailing efforts to locate a photo potentially held by Newsweek related to individuals described as 'bums' in police custody at the assassination scene.",
