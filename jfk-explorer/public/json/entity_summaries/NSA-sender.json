  "summary": "The National Security Agency (NSA) is a key intelligence organization that plays a significant role in monitoring global communications and gathering intelligence. In the context of the JFK assassination, the NSA's primary function was to intercept and analyze communications from various countries, including Cuba, the Soviet Union, and other nations, to assess their reactions to the assassination and gather any relevant information. The NSA intercepted diplomatic cables, military communications, and other forms of intelligence to understand the global impact of Kennedy's death and to identify any potential threats or plots. The documents reveal the NSA's efforts to monitor Cuban government reactions, including Fidel Castro's statements and military alerts, as well as the responses from other countries, such as condolences, mourning periods, and diplomatic activities. The NSA also provided information to the Warren Commission and later responded to queries from the Senate Select Committee on Assassinations and the Assassination Records Review Board, detailing its limited role in assisting the Commission and providing records related to the assassination.",
