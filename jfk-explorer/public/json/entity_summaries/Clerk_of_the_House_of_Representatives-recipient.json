  "summary": "The documents provided primarily relate to the payroll records of staff members who worked for the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The Clerk of the House of Representatives, in this context, appears to be the recipient of notifications and documentation related to these payroll records. Specifically, the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) sent notifications regarding the postponed release of certain information, such as Social Security numbers, from the HSCA staff payroll records to the Clerk of the House. This suggests that the Clerk's office was responsible for maintaining and managing these records, and was therefore notified of any decisions affecting their release. The documents span from the late 1970s, during the HSCA's active investigation, to the mid-1990s when the ARRB was reviewing these records for public release.",

  "significance": "The Clerk of the House of Representatives' significance in the JFK assassination context, based on these documents, lies in their role as the custodian of the HSCA's staff payroll records. They were the recipient of notifications from the ARRB regarding the release or postponement of information contained within these records, indicating their responsibility for maintaining and managing these sensitive documents. While not directly involved in the investigation itself, their office played a crucial role in the preservation and eventual review of records related to the HSCA's work.",
