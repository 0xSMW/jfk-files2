The documents suggest that deportation was a tool used to manage or remove individuals who were considered threats or of interest to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The connections to figures like Giancana and Trafficante, who have been linked to the Mafia and potential involvement in the assassination, highlight the importance of understanding how these individuals were monitored and controlled.",
