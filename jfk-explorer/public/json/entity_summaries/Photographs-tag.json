  "summary": "Photographs appear in the documents primarily in the context of distribution and identification. They are used to disseminate information, as seen in the request to send copies of photographs to various stations that received DIR 92664. Photographs also play a role in identifying individuals, such as Carlos Marcello, where the FBI sought identification from informants in different field offices. The documents suggest that the distribution and handling of these photographs were controlled, with specific instructions regarding routing, dissemination, and the protection of informant identities. The timeline of involvement is primarily focused around April 1968, with an earlier instance in November 1966.",
