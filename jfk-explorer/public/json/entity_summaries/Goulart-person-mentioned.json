While the documents do not directly link Goulart to the JFK assassination, they highlight the U.S. government's interest and involvement in Brazilian politics during a period of instability. The documents suggest that the U.S. government was monitoring the political climate in Brazil and considering potential interventions or responses to changes in leadership.",
