  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, Bob Kelley's significance in the JFK context is not explicitly detailed. The documents focus on his role as FBI Director and his involvement in intelligence oversight, but do not directly link him to the JFK assassination. His connection to the JFK context is therefore indirect, stemming from his leadership role in the FBI during a period when investigations and inquiries related to intelligence matters were ongoing.",
