  "summary": "COMINT, or Communications Intelligence, is a type of intelligence gathered by intercepting communications. Based on the provided documents, COMINT played a role in understanding Soviet radar coverage and the effectiveness of their warning systems in the 1950s. One document mentions COMINT and ELINT (Electronic Intelligence) being used together to gain insights into Soviet air defense. While the documents do not directly link COMINT to the JFK assassination, one document discusses a HSCA request for information on the U-2 Project and Soviet knowledge of the program, suggesting that the committee was interested in intelligence gathering capabilities and potential Soviet awareness of US activities. The documents highlight COMINT's role in gathering information about Soviet activities and capabilities during the Cold War.",
