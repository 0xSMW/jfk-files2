  "summary": "Jose Figueres Ferrer was a prominent political figure, specifically the ex-President of Costa Rica. In the context of the provided documents, Figueres is mentioned in connection with a CIA plan (Project JMHART) to influence him and Foreign Minister Uduber to promote AMWORLD and AMBIDDY-1. This plan involved leveraging Cuban exile organizations and seeking support from other Latin American leaders like Betancourt. While the documents do not directly link Figueres to the JFK assassination, they suggest that the CIA considered him an influential figure in Latin America who could be persuaded to support their initiatives during the early 1960s. The other two documents do not contain any information about Figueres.",
