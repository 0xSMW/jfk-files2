  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the mention of CIA agents is significant because it raises questions about the agency's potential involvement in events surrounding the assassination. The guidelines for interacting with the HSCA, specifically concerning interviews with NOCs and agents, suggest a need for careful management of information related to these individuals. The activities of agents in Cuba, as well as their connections to individuals and organizations, could be relevant to understanding the broader context of the assassination and the various theories surrounding it.",
