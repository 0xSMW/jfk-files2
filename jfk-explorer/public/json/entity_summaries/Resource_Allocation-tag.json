  "summary": "Resource allocation, in the context of these documents, refers to the distribution of funds, personnel, and other assets to support intelligence activities and the declassification of JFK assassination records. The documents highlight the importance of adequate resource allocation for the CIA to fulfill its responsibilities, including intelligence gathering, coordination, and compliance with legal mandates such as the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act. The Senate Select Committee discusses the DCI's responsibilities, resource allocation, and coordination of intelligence activities, including budgetary matters and potential limitations on fund reprogramming. The JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) expressed concerns about the CIA's commitment to providing sufficient resources to meet deadlines for declassifying JFK assassination records, and the CIA internally discussed resource allocation and funding for this project. The pace of declassification was directly linked to the availability of resources.",
