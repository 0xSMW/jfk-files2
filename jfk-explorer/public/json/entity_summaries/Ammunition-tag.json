  "summary": "The documents mention ammunition in various contexts, primarily related to arms shipments, testing, and requests for information. One document details tests of modified sights for the 7.62 Belgium (FAL) Rifle, implying the use of specific ammunition for testing purposes. Another document involves a request for derogatory information on the Military Armament Corporation (MAC), which shipped machine gun and pistol ammunition to a local firm named U.S. Army Surplus Guns and Ammunition. Additionally, there's a message concerning the delivery of cartridges to Corpus Christi. These instances suggest that ammunition was a commodity being tracked and moved, potentially related to covert operations or military activities. However, none of the documents directly link ammunition to the JFK assassination.",
