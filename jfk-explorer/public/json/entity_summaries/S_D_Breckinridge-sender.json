  "summary": "S. D. Breckinridge is identified as the sender of a memorandum dated September 22, 1978, addressed to Ray Reardon. In this memo, Breckinridge requests photographs of Agency employees with the surname Bishop who were employed in the 1960s. The purpose of this request was to aid witnesses in identifying a person named Morris Bishop. While the documents do not explicitly detail Breckinridge's role or significance in the JFK assassination context, the request for photographs suggests an investigative or identification process related to individuals potentially connected to the case. The other two documents do not mention S. D. Breckinridge.",
