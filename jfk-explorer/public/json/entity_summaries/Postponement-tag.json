  "summary": "The term \"Postponement\" in these documents refers to the delayed release of specific information within assassination-related records, primarily HSCA (House Select Committee on Assassinations) staff payroll records. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) frequently issued \"Final Determination Notifications\" regarding these postponements. The main reason cited for postponement is the protection of personal privacy, specifically the redaction of Social Security numbers from payroll records. These postponements were often temporary, with future review dates set (e.g., 2017). The notifications acknowledge the historical interest in the documents while balancing it with privacy concerns. A consistent pattern across the documents is the focus on HSCA staff payroll records and the redaction of Social Security numbers.",

It highlights the challenges in releasing historical records that contain sensitive personal data. The postponements, while intended to protect privacy, can also raise questions about transparency and the completeness of the historical record.",
