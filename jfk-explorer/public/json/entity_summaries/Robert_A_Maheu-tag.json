  "summary": "Robert A. Maheu was a personnel relations executive and former FBI agent who was utilized by the CIA's Office of Security for sensitive assignments starting in the early 1950s. He had a diverse employment history, including time with the FBI, the Small Business Administration, and his own investigative organization, Robert A. Maheu Associates. Maheu was recruited by the CIA in 1954 and became involved in covert operations, including the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro and providing companionship to King Hussein of Jordan. He was also considered for handling Jordanian public relations in the U.S., with the U.S. government and CIA aware of his involvement. Later, he was investigated by International Intelligence, Inc. (INTERTEL) on behalf of the Hughes Tool Company. The Senate Subcommittee's interest in his activities posed a potential risk to the Agency.",
