  "significance": "The provided documents do not directly link the Black Panther Party to the JFK assassination. The significance lies in the CIA's surveillance and monitoring of the BPP during the late 1960s and early 1970s, reflecting the agency's broader interest in domestic political movements and potential threats to national security.",
