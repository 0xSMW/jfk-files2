This includes evaluating manuscripts for sensitive disclosures, managing the release of information to external bodies like the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), and investigating potential security risks posed by individuals with connections to the Agency. The Director of Security is involved in assessing the bona fides of individuals like Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko, managing information related to Edward P. Morgan, Lyon L. Tyler, and Herbert Itkin, and ensuring the security of Agency operations and sources.",
