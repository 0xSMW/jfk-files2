The DCI's role in overseeing CIA activities during the period leading up to and following the assassination makes the office a key point of interest for understanding potential intelligence-related aspects of the event. The documents suggest a concern for protecting intelligence sources and methods even in the face of mandated disclosures related to the assassination records.",
