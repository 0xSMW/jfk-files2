  "summary": "Samuel Mannarino was involved in gambling and racketeering activities, primarily in the Pittsburgh area, alongside his brother Gabriel Mannarino. The FBI investigated their operations, including gambling at a farm in Westmoreland County, PA, and their takeover of Lloyds, Limited, a men's clothing store, as a front for gambling and loan sharking. Samuel Mannarino's activities extended beyond Pittsburgh, as indicated by information received from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). He was considered armed and dangerous by the FBI. There is also a report of his arrival in Pittsburgh from Miami and a potential threat against Martin Murin, a contractor who had a dispute with the Mannarinos. Increased law enforcement pressure, including an IRS investigation into Willie Sams, led to the suppression of gambling activities in New Kensington, PA, where the Mannarinos were operating.",
