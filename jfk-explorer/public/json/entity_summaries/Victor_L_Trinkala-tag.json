  "summary": "Victor L. Trinkala was a U.S. Army soldier who enlisted underage and was later separated from service as a conscientious objector. He is mentioned in connection with Richard C. Nagell, who intervened to prevent Trinkala's deployment to Vietnam. An anonymous caller reported that Trinkala, en route to Vietnam, was allegedly contacted by a \"Soviet Agent\" due to his conscientious objector status, potentially to be used in anti-U.S. propaganda. The documents suggest an investigation into Trinkala's background and his association with Nagell, particularly regarding his separation from military service.",
