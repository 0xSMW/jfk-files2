  "summary": "The Rockefeller Commission, officially known as the President's Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States, was established in 1975 to investigate the activities of the CIA within the United States. The documents indicate that the CIA provided reports and depositions to the Rockefeller Commission. One report critiques the counterintelligence function within the CIA, particularly concerning Soviet defectors and penetrations. Another document details the history and activities of the CIA's Miami Station, including its role in anti-Castro activities and support for Cuban exiles. A deposition from William C. Sturbitts, a CIA Special Assistant for Latin America, discusses his involvement in Cuban operations and economic warfare. These documents suggest the Rockefeller Commission was actively gathering information about CIA activities related to Cuba and counterintelligence during the period following the JFK assassination.",
