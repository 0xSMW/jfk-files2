  "summary": "The term \"Redaction\" in these documents refers to the act of obscuring or removing sensitive information from documents before their release to the public, particularly concerning the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) records related to the JFK assassination. The primary reason for redaction is to protect personal privacy, specifically Social Security numbers of HSCA staff members. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) made final determination notifications regarding these redactions, often postponing the release of Social Security numbers. These redactions appear consistently in payroll records and related personnel documents from the HSCA, with review dates set to re-evaluate the need for continued redaction. Redaction is also mentioned in the context of declassifying British Security Service (BSS) documents and informing individuals that their names appear in JFK Assassination Records, offering them the opportunity to prevent public release.",

  "significance": "Redaction is significant in the JFK context as it reflects the balance between transparency and the protection of personal information within historical records. The redactions, primarily of Social Security numbers, highlight the ARRB's efforts to comply with privacy laws while still making assassination-related documents available to the public. The process of redaction and the justifications behind it provide insight into the sensitivity of the information contained within these records and the ongoing debate about access to historical documents.",
