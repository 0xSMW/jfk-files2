  "summary": "The documents provided do not directly discuss Washington as an entity. Instead, they reference interactions and information sharing (or lack thereof) with entities within Washington, specifically a House of Representatives committee (likely the House Select Committee on Assassinations) and potentially other government bodies. The documents highlight concerns about sharing sensitive information with these entities due to fears of leaks and the Freedom of Information Act. The documents suggest that Washington, in the form of its governmental bodies, was a recipient of information related to anti-Castro activities, potential terrorist connections, and investigations into foreign organizations like the Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO). The documents span from 1977 to 1979.",

  "significance": "The significance of Washington in the JFK context, based on these documents, lies in its role as a potential recipient of information related to individuals and organizations that may have had connections to the assassination or related activities. The reluctance of certain sources to share information with Washington entities suggests concerns about transparency and potential exposure of sensitive intelligence.",
