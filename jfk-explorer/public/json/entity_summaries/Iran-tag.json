  "summary": "The documents mention Iran in several contexts spanning from 1963 to 1993. In 1978, the \"Iranian situation\" was a topic of discussion between the DCI and Chairman Boland of the HPSCI. Later, in 1993, there was a proposal for potential joint operations targeting Iranian military officers in Belarus. While these documents mention Iran, they do not directly link Iran to the JFK assassination. The references are more related to broader geopolitical concerns and potential operational activities during the Cold War and its aftermath.",
