  "summary": "201 files are a type of record maintained by the CIA, as evidenced by the documents. These files are central to the CIA's information management practices, covering the opening, maintenance, and handling of sensitive information. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) requested information on the criteria for these files, indicating their relevance to investigations. The CIA provided regulations (DOHB 70-1-1 and CSHB 43-1-1) to address the HSCA's inquiries, asserting that these regulations answered all questions regarding the Operations Directorate's management of 201 files. The documents suggest that 201 files were a standard part of CIA record-keeping and operational procedures during the period relevant to the JFK assassination investigations.",
