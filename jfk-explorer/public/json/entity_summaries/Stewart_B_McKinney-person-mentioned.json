  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Stewart B. McKinney is mentioned within the context of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) staff payroll records and related documentation. While the documents themselves do not explicitly detail McKinney's role or activities, his name appears in association with the HSCA, indicating he was likely either a staff member or otherwise connected to the committee's operations. The documents primarily concern administrative matters such as payroll, personnel records, and privacy considerations related to the release of Social Security numbers. The repeated mention of HSCA staff payroll records suggests a focus on the administrative aspects of the committee's work rather than substantive investigative details related to the JFK assassination itself.",
