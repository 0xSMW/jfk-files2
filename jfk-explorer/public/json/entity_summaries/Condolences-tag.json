  "summary": "The documents reflect a global outpouring of condolences following President John F. Kennedy's assassination in November 1963. These messages of sympathy and mourning came from various sources, including governments, heads of state (e.g., the King and Queen of Thailand, Field Marshal Sarit of Thailand, the King of Morocco), government officials (e.g., Nguyen Ngoc Tho of South Vietnam, Cambodian Prime Minister, Salvadoran Foreign Ministry), organizations (e.g., the Intersect Committee in Buddhism of Vitnam), and even private citizens. The condolences were directed towards President Lyndon B. Johnson, Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and the American people. The messages often expressed shock, sorrow, and admiration for Kennedy's efforts towards peace and progress. Some documents also detail the specific actions taken by foreign governments, such as flying flags at half-mast, sending delegations to the funeral, and issuing public statements of mourning. The reactions varied across countries, with some expressing genuine grief and others showing more measured responses due to existing political relations.",
