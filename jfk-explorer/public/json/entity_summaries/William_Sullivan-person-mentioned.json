  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, William Sullivan is not directly mentioned. However, the documents heavily feature Alan G. Sentinella's testimony before the Senate Select Committee (SSC) regarding investigations into Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison. These investigations involved electronic surveillance and alleged communist connections. While Sullivan's name doesn't appear, the context of FBI investigations into potential subversive activities and surveillance operations is present. One document mentions John Rosselli's activities and associations, and another discusses the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) meeting covering audiosurveillance and intelligence briefings. Howard J. Osborn's testimony regarding CIA's Office of Security activities, including electronic and physical surveillance, is also noted. The absence of William Sullivan's direct involvement suggests that his role, if any, is indirect or not explicitly detailed within these documents.",
