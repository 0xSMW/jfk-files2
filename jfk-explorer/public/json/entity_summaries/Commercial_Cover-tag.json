  "summary": "Commercial cover refers to the use of commercial entities or employment as a disguise or means of facilitating intelligence operations. The documents indicate that commercial cover was utilized by the CIA for various purposes, including intelligence gathering and providing employment for CIA personnel. Specifically, ICAP Iberia, S.A. was considered for exploitation by the Madrid Station, and Lykes Steamship Company provided cover for three CIA employees between 1962 and 1964. Additionally, the possibility of recruiting retired KGB Colonel Oleg M. Nechiporenko under commercial cover was explored during his U.S. visit. The use of commercial entities allowed the CIA to operate with a degree of secrecy and plausible deniability.",

The documents illustrate how the CIA utilized commercial entities to maintain secrecy and facilitate operations, which could be relevant in understanding the broader context of the agency's activities during the period surrounding the assassination.",
