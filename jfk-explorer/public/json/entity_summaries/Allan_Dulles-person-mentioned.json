  "summary": "Allan Dulles is mentioned in the context of the JFK assassination primarily through documents detailing the NSA's and other agencies' responses to inquiries from the Warren Commission and later the Senate Select Committee and House Select Committee on Assassinations. While Dulles himself isn't directly discussed in terms of his actions or involvement in the assassination in these documents, the documents reflect the investigations into potential connections or intelligence failures related to the event. The NSA reviewed its files and provided information regarding Cuban communications, military alerts, and other relevant data to these committees. The documents suggest a focus on determining if there was any intelligence indicating Cuban involvement or prior knowledge of the assassination, and Dulles' name appears in the context of these broader investigations and inquiries.",
