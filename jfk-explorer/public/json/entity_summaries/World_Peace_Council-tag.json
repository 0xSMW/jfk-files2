  "summary": "The World Peace Council (WPC) is an organization that appears in several documents. One document mentions a disruption at a WPC meeting caused by a Chinese delegate who denounced President Kennedy after expressions of sorrow for his death. Other documents detail U.S. participants at a WPC meeting in Budapest in 1971, including Sidney Peck's speech on the Vietnam War, a posthumous award to Martin Luther King Jr., and the reelection of Herbert Aptheker and Carlton Goodlett to the Presidential Board. The documents suggest the WPC was a venue for international discussions and included participation from various countries and individuals with diverse political views.",

  "significance": "The World Peace Council is mentioned in the context of a Chinese delegate denouncing President Kennedy after his death, suggesting the organization was a forum where reactions to the assassination were expressed. The other documents highlight the WPC's activities and U.S. participation, but do not directly link the WPC to the JFK assassination beyond the initial disruption.",
