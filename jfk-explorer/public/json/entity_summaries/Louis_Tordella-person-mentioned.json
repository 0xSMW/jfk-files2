  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Louis Tordella is mentioned in the context of the Senate Select Committee's (SSC) inquiries to the NSA concerning the Warren Commission. The documents detail the NSA's responses to the SSC's queries regarding the Warren Commission's investigation into the JFK assassination. While Louis Tordella's specific role or actions are not explicitly detailed in the summaries, the documents indicate that the NSA was involved in reviewing exhibits for secret writing, providing information about Cuban military alerts after the assassination, and generally assisting the Warren Commission. The documents suggest that the NSA's involvement was limited, and no results relevant to the assassination were obtained. The consistent date of the documents (January 26, 1976) indicates a concentrated effort to respond to the SSC's inquiries at that time.",
