  "summary": "Alton Quanbeck is mentioned in a series of documents related to the Senate Select Committee's (SSC) inquiries to the National Security Agency (NSA) concerning the Warren Commission's investigation into the JFK assassination. While the documents detail the NSA's limited role in assisting the Warren Commission, including reviewing exhibits for secret writing and providing information about Cuban military alerts after the assassination, the specific role or actions of Alton Quanbeck are not explicitly detailed. The documents primarily focus on the NSA's responses to the SSC's queries and the scope of their involvement in the original Warren Commission investigation. Therefore, the significance of Alton Quanbeck within these documents is unclear, as the documents do not specify his direct involvement or contributions.",
