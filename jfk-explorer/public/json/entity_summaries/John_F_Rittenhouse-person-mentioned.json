  "summary": "John F. Rittenhouse was an individual associated with the CIA's Overseas Branch (OPC). In late 1950, there were plans to change his status from OPC Staff Employee to OPC Staff Agent and assign him to Mexico City as a GS-13 Intelligence Officer under State Department deep cover. This involved obtaining security concurrence. However, his security clearance was later canceled, and he was reclassified as a semi-covert employee integrated into a department. He is also mentioned in a document related to security deletions and revisions in E. Howard Hunt's manuscript, 'Undercover: Memoirs of an American Agent.'",

Howard Hunt, a figure associated with the Watergate scandal and alleged involvement in the JFK assassination, might warrant further investigation. However, the documents primarily focus on his CIA status and assignment in the 1950s, with a later mention in the context of Hunt's memoirs.",
