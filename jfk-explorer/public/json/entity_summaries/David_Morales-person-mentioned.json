  "summary": "David Morales is a person mentioned in several CIA documents related to the JFK assassination records. The documents primarily concern the handling and transfer of his alias documents, including identification cards and a Mexican passport, in 1973. One memo details the transfer of these documents from Foreign Resources (FR) Plans Chief Robert Baker to WH/Security. While the documents don't explicitly detail Morales' role in the JFK assassination, the repeated mention of his alias documents within the context of the ARRB's (Assassination Records Review Board) concerns suggests a potential connection to sensitive operations or identities the CIA sought to protect. The documents span from 1973 to 1998, with the later memos discussing the ARRB's efforts to obtain assassination-related records, including alias documentation, indicating the continued relevance of Morales' records to the JFK investigation.",
