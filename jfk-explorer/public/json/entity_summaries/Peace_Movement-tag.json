Instead, they focus on justifying the classification of EX 3600 due to its connection to Operation MHCHAOS and the inclusion of information from sensitive sources and classified FBI reports. The documents do not provide any information about the Peace Movement's involvement, timeline, or connections beyond the fact that EX 3600 is somehow related to it.",
