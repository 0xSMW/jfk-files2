  "significance": "While the primary focus of these documents is the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination, the HSCA's investigation into this event occurred concurrently with their investigation into the John F. Kennedy assassination. The documents highlight the HSCA's broad mandate to investigate political assassinations and the FBI's role in providing information to the committee. The mention of the HSCA in these documents connects the MLK assassination investigation to the broader context of investigations into political violence during that era.",
