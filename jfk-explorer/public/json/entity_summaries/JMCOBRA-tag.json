  "summary": "JMCOBRA appears to be a CIA designation or location, possibly a station or project. The documents suggest it was a place to which personnel were assigned, as evidenced by the request for Joseph S. Piccolo's reassignment to JMCOBRA from Managua, Nicaragua. The other documents do not directly relate to JMCOBRA's function but are related to intelligence gathering and operations in Latin America, specifically Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. One document mentions LIRING-3, an individual providing information on the insurgency movement in Guatemala, and another discusses SECEN's activities and contacts. The documents suggest JMCOBRA was involved in or connected to intelligence activities in the region during the late 1960s.",
