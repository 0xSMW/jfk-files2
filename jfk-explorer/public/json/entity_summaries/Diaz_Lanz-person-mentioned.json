According to one document, an FBI source in Jamaica reported that a Cuban diplomat, Enrique Montero, alleged that Diaz Lanz, along with other Cuban exiles, was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This allegation was reportedly made during a Communist Party meeting in the Cuban Embassy. Other documents do not directly mention Diaz Lanz's involvement in the JFK assassination but provide context about Cuban exiles and resistance activities against the Castro regime during the early 1960s.",
