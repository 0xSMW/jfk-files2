  "summary": "\"Bureau Informant 100\" refers to a procedure established by the FBI in 1954 for handling information received from James Angleton of the CIA. This information was largely sourced from a liaison arrangement with the Israeli Intelligence Service. The FBI memos discuss the handling of this sensitive information and the eventual recommendation to discontinue a separate control file for it, as the information was already recorded in separate case files and deemed obsolete. The procedure involved the CIA forwarding information by courier in sealed envelopes.",
