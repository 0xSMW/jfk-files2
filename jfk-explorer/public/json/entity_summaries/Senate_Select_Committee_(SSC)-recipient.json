  "significance": "While the documents do not explicitly mention the JFK assassination, the SSC's investigation into intelligence activities, particularly those of the FBI, could indirectly relate to the JFK context if the investigation uncovered information relevant to the events surrounding the assassination or the subsequent investigations. The focus on surveillance, potential communist connections, and the monitoring of individuals are areas that could potentially intersect with the JFK assassination narrative.",
