  "significance": "While not directly linked to the JFK assassination in these documents, Santo Domingo's significance lies in its role as a location for covert operations, intelligence gathering, and its connection to individuals and groups involved in anti-Castro activities and alleged espionage. The documents highlight the CIA's presence and activities in the Dominican Republic during the 1960s and 1970s, which indirectly provides context to the broader landscape of covert operations during that era.",
