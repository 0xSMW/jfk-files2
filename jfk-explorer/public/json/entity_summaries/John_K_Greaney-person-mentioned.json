Therefore, it is impossible to provide a summary of their role, significance, connections, timeline, or patterns based solely on these documents. The documents primarily concern Joseph R. Merola's contacts with the CIA, Gordon Novel's claims of CIA affiliation, and Herbert Itkin's use as an informant. Without direct references to John K. Greaney within these documents, any attempt to construct a summary would be speculative and inaccurate.",
