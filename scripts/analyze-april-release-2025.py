the international scene without consulting its allies, just as in Stalin's time.
The Rumantans cited the 1962 missile adventure in Cuba and Soviet positions
on disarmament. Shelepin agreed that more coordination was needed. Smith was

Bromley Smith now and then modified or rewrote items when

formulate a new constitution and that the State Department looked upon this
as
hopeful. Heidemann agreed that OCI had written in ignorance of this information,
but added that offhand he would not be optimistic.

However, this change in delivery/forced other changes. The President wanted
the Brief at 6:30 a.m., just before he began reading the newspapers. This meant

marked \"changed\".

CSLA indicated COOVER is using the Bella Stumbo
alias in connection with her position as a stari writer For
the \"Los Angeles Times\".

ACTION

ADEX should be changed to include the new alias and
subject's position as a staff writer for the Times. Also,
since subject is writing under a still different pseudonym,
for the Monterey Park Progress newspapers, it is suggested
that consideration be given to advising the Internal Revenue
Service that she may be receiving payroll checks under these
pseudonyms and not reporting her total income correctly. Appro-
priate investigation should be conducted to verify subject's
use of the additional pseudonym.

Early in the evening of July 2, 4-year-old girl
nomed Joyce Ann Hull was shot to derin as she played
in a yard in Hawarian Gordens. She was hit with 42
shotqun pellets med from a possing car. Subsequently.
there Chicong youths from the neighboring Norwalk
bonio were arrested. Being held on sesalcion of murder
in the killing ore Donald Anteio, 21, Oscar Hernandez,
22, and Michaci Ramirez, 17.

Donald Antelo's mother Beatrice, 50, is a devout.
Catholic. She has a makeshift altar in her bedroom
where she prays each night before going to bed.
She had just finished her rosary the night police
came looking for her son.

\"There were four of them at the door. They
rushed through the house, searching for Don. I
said he wasult home, but what did they want. him
for? And they said because he shot a little girl,
that my boy killed a child.\"

Beatrice Antelo was sitting at her kitchen table,
staring listiessly at a cold cup of coffee in front of
her, her voice a weary whisper.

\"They didn't have uniforms on, so I thought
maybe they were some of Don's friends playing a
bad joke. I told them to stop fooling around about
something so awful.\"

Though it was nearly noon now. Beatrice Antelo
still wore her houserobe and slippers. Her small
kitchen was half lost in the stagnant gloom of
drawn shades and closed windows,

would never in his life do such a turrids thing.\"

She knew her son. He was a good boy. He loved
children lie and his girlfriend wanted to have a
pie family when they got married-which would
be as soon as Don found a job, it isn't easy to find
a job when you don't have a car to look outside the
harrie, she had explained,
Meantince she pointed out. Don was a good stu-
dent at Cerritos College. He studied hard, made
good grades, \"was determined to make something
out of himself.\"

Beatrice Antelo absentmindedly stroked a tiny
brown dog sleeping peacefully in her lap. He is
her watchdog. When strangers approach the
house, he pokes his head through a broken living
room window pane and barks with comic ferocity.
Don had been in trouble before, of course, she
continued, an edge of bitterness creeping into her
voice as she told how he had been thrown out of
Excelsior High School four years ago because \"he
had long hair before it was common.\" He had
brushes with the police before, too, she said, with
out claborating--but most barrio youths have si-
milar experiences.

'Won't Care About Saving flim'
\"You have to live here to know what it's like.
Police everywhere, poverty you can't escape, no
jobs...\" Her voice trailed off in a resigned shrug.
She makes less than $3,000 annually, so she can't
afford to hire a private attorney to defend her son,
she said. And she's certain the court-appointed
public defender \"won't care about saving him.\"

A cough suddenly seized her. The doctor has
warned her against interviews, she explained. She
doesn't answer the telephone much anymore eith-
er because it often turns out to be somebody call-
ing her the mother of a monster or threatening to
bomb ber house or, worse still, to harm her older
son, 31, a father of two with a job outside Nor-
walk.

\"I guess it makes people feel better to get the
hate off their chests when something as horrible
as this happens,\" she sighed. \"I just hang up.\"

But her mind clearly wasn't on berself-it was
still on that last night on the scene that had
awaited her when she and the two officers re-
turned home.

On a couch hati covered
by a sheet, Yolanda Rami-
rez, 24, the senior daughter,
was outshouting a Popeye
the
television. Now seven-
cartoon blaring on
months pregnant, for the
third time, she was trying
to resolve the question of a
missing blouse with her
sister Marina, 21, six
months pregnant, who sat
methodically rolling
breakfast beans into tortur
les, burrito style, at the
end of the room.

A near-obese third
daughter, Sylvia, mother
of two of the rampaging
children, sat hulging out
of her tight shorts, fan-
ning herself with a purple
crochet doily which she
had snatched from a
screaming baby who had
spun it wildly in the air
long enough finally to
knock the fire off her ciga-
ret and get smacked for it.

\"God, they'll all get the

via.

\"Well, bell, they all gotia

Yolanda sagely, demon-

women, she is by far the
most philosophic.

Nobody looked, either,
like they even remem-

denly reminded them.

\"I don't even have the
money for gas to go see

The mood in the room
changed instantly to se-
riousness.

body present, it seemed,
was not so much Mike's
plight, but rather the ef-
fect it would have on his
mother when she returns
from Mexico, sometime
later this week.

He shrugged. looking
around at his daughters,
who listened, suddenly si
leni.

Most of his kids had
either been kicked out of
school for making trouble
or they had quit in dis-
gust, he continued.

One son. 22, was in jail
already, for undisclosed
reasons. Only his oldest
boy, 28, had even golien
out of the Norwalk barrio,
although, Ramirez digress-
ed, he had hopes for his
youngest son, 15, who was
\"a good student and a hard
worker.\"

Meantime, whatever his
kids had done, Ramirez
said, he knew one thing
for sure.

\"My son Mike would
never hurt a kid or be part
of a rotten thing like that.
He may have been mean
sometime, but he would
not take it out on babies.\"

But, sighed Ramirez, it's
out of his hands now. And
the whole fantily expects
the worst.

\"They'll just figure he's

was followed in the Atomic Energy Act applicant case whereby
the Washington Field Office was not alerted to the fact that
Harold Ickes, whose name was given as a reference, should not be
interviewed.

There is attached a memorandum dated December 20, 1949 from
Mr. Rosen to Mr. Ladd with respect to the specific Atomic Energy case
mentioned, namely Fred Ernest Schnepfe, who had given Harold Ickes
as a reference on his PSQ or application form. From a reading of the
attached memorandum which was prepared by Section Chief G. C. Callan
of the Applicant Section, it is obvious that the Supervisors who handle
applicant matters in the Investigative Division do not have any policy
with respect to the interviewing of references, former employers,
associates or others except where the Bureau has specifically indicated
that certain individuals should not be contacted, such as Henry Steele
Commager, personnel of CBS and the like. As a matter of fact, the
present policy in effect at the Seat of Government concerning applicant
investigations is to interview all references and the attached memorandum
indicates that Harold Ickes had been interviewed in the past in connec-
tion with applicant investigations and has exhibited a cooperative
attitude. It would seem, therefore, that no action should be taken
with respect to the supervisory personnel at the Seat of Government con-
cerning the referral of Harold Ickes' name to the Washington Field
Office for interview in connection with the Atomic Energy Act case:
mentioned.

As you know, at the Executives Conference the Director's wishes
with regard to interviewing persons who have demonstrated hostile、
attitudes toward the Bureau have been considered in the past and no
instructións have been issued to the Supervisors at the Seat of Govern-
ment or to the field concerning this matter except as to specific in-
dividuals whose names have been sent to the field in the recent past
in an SAC Letter. This matter was called to the attention of the
Executives Conference as recently as December 20, 1949 and the Confer-
ence felt it would be undesirable for the Bureau to embark upon a pro-
gram of advising the field to not interview certain individuals in
connection with various types of investigations conducted by the Bureau.
The Executives Conference realized that the hostile attitude toward the
Bureau stems not from our criminal investigative work but from the
Eureau's investigative activity in the field of applicant investigations
and the Loyalty Program. The Conference feels that the blacklisting
of individuals is fundamentally bad and will ultimately result in ex-
treme embarrassment to the Bureau. It is also felt it is extremely

lifficult to draft a letter to all SAC's pointing up the problem to
them and expecting them to adhere to any policy which will eliminate
the difficulty which we have encountered heretofore.

I have discussed this matter with Mr. Carlson in some detail
and he feels that we may be able to control to some extent the inter-
viewing of persons hostile to the iureau at the Seat of Government
without furnishing a \"black list\" or statement of policy to the field.
Mr. Carlson feels, and I agree with him, that the major portion of our
difficulty stems from the Loyalty investigations and applicant investi-
gations. Mr. Carlson and I therefore propose that the following pro-
cedure be instituted immediately at the Seat of Government in order to
meet the objectives desired by the Director in 'connection with this
matter:
-

1. The Crime Records Section shall be responsible for preparing
and maintaining in a current status a list of those individuals known
to be hostile to the Bureau. It is felt that it is imperative that a
list bé prepared. because the judgment of individual Supervisors re-
ferring cases to the field will differ depending upon the extent of
their day to day newspaper reading, radio listening and perusal of
various and sundry periodicals. It would also mean that each Supervisor
would have to either prepare his own list or endeavor to depend on a
faulty memory. Furthermore, an individual may at one time appear to be
hostile to the Bureau and subsequently his attitude may change and it
may be very desirable to interview him.

2. This list shall be furnished to only those Supervisors at the.
Seat of Government who have the responsibility for assigning Loyalty
or applicant cases to the field. This will include Supervisors in the
Loyalty Section of the Security Division, the Applicant Section of the f
Investigative Division and those Supervisors in the Administrative
Division handling Bureau applicant cases. This will mean that not more
than 25 Supervisors at most at the Seat of Government will have pos-
session of such a list. These Supervisors shall check all references
and present and former employers against this list before referring
the case to the field for investigation.

It should be realized that the procedure recommended will not
provide against interviews with neighbors of the applicants or
associates whose names are brought up during the course of the inves-
tigation. It is felt, however, that the bulk of the people who are
interviewed in these cases are set out as references by the applicant
and it would only be on a rare occasion that a person hostile to the
Bureau will be interviewed on a neighborhood investigation or as an
associate of the applicant.

structions, considered the attached memorandum of December 21,
1949, with respect to the procedures in conducting applicant
investigations and particularly the method suggested to avoid inter
avoid inter
views with those individuals having a hostile or critical attitude 1
toward the Bureau and its work.
ン

It was pointed out to the Conference that apparently the
hostility and criticism of the Bureau stem not from our normal day to
day criminal investigative work but to a very slight extent to inves-
tigations in the Internal Security field and very specifically and
definitely to applicant and Loyalty investigations. It was felt that
if some procedure could be devised to avoid interviews with individuals
in applicant type cases where the individuals have exhibited a hostile
or critical attitude toward the Bureau that much could be accomplished
to eliminate the difficulties experienced in the past. The Conference
felt it would be undesirable to prepare a list of any sort which might
be termed a \"blacklist\" to be distributed to all of the divisional
offices. It was proposed that the following procedure be instituted
immediately at the Seat of Government in order to meet the objectives
desired by the Director in connection with this matter:

1. The Crime Records Section shall be responsible for preparing
and maintaining in a current status a list of those individuals, known
to be hostile to the Bureau. It is felt that it is imperative that a

NOTE:
The Attorney General, on 8/8/75, and the Deputy
Attorney General, met with Associate Director Nicholas P. Callahan,
Assistant Director W. Kaymond Wannall, and Inspector John B. Hotis
to discuss the request of the Senate Select Committee for the identities
of sources utilized to effect Cointelpro activities. The Attorney General
indicated prior to discussing this problem, which relates to the over-
all confidentiality of FBI sources, with Senator Church, Chairman of
the Committee, he desired to be furnished information which would
enable him to insure himself there were no Cointelpro activities of a
scandalous or infamous nature which at a later date could cause em-
barrassment to the Department. The attached memorandum was
prepared during the period 8/8-12/75 by personnel of the Internal
Security Branch of the Intelligence Division. It represents a careful
review of all Cointelpro actions where results were known. It is
pointed out in the majority of authorized Cointelpro actions results
were not recorded. Also, because of the wide variety of Cointelpro
actions, results in many areas are not subject to measurement. For
example, there is no way of determining how many individuals left the
Communist Party as a result of our documented mailings relating to
Soviet anti-semitism,

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS

Classified because sets forth information which,
if disclosed, could compromise sensitive intel-
ligence sources and methods.

In an effort to assess possible damage incurred by
subversive and extremist organizations and individuals as a result of
Counter intelligence Program (Cointelpro) activity, a current review
has been made of the programs relating to the Communist Party, USA,
Socialist Workers Party, White Hate Groups, New Left and Black
Extremists.

The \"Study Committee Report on FBI Counterintelligence
Programs,\" prepared in May, 1974, by the Department-FBI Committee
headed by former Assistant Attorney General Henry E. Petersen, tabu-
lated 3, 208 proposals for counterintelligence action during the period
1956 until all programs were discontinued on April 28, 1971. Of these,
according to the Petersen report, 2,340 were reported approved and im-
plemented and results were reported as known in 516 instances. Our
current review has developed 620 instances where results of varying
degrees are known. Excluding results of actions which appear to have
been appropriate and proper law enforcement procedures, we have
summarized results in 164 instances. In any instance where there
was any question regarding the propriety of the action, doubts were
resolved by preparing a summary.

For ready review, summaries of the actions in these 164
instances have been placed in categories and are attached as follows:

In July, 1964, an anonymous letter was sent to
a number of individuals in the Superior, Wisconsin, area
who advertised in \"Tyomies-Eteenpain,\" a Finnish language
newspaper published in Wisconsin noting the similarity
of editorials in \"The Worker,\" published by the Communist
Party, USA, to alert these advertisers to the communist
nature of this newspaper so they might withdraw their
support.
:
There was no known withdrawal of support for
this newspaper, but at the same time, the newspaper was
applying for membership in the Superior, Wisconsin,
Chamber of Commerce and their application was denied.

In December, 1969, an anonymous letter was directed
to selected members of the United Klans of America, Inc. (UKA),
by the Richmond Office. This letter denounced Robert H.
Hudgins, Grand Dragon of Virginia, characterizing him as one
interested in personal gain only. The content of the letter
suggested that it had been prepared by Raymond Adams, a
former UKA member, who had been banished and had been at
odds with Hudgins.

The anonymous mailing resulted in continuing
disruption and mistrust in certain Klan units. Hudgins'
leadership was challenged. The unrest at Danville, Virginia,
caused a great reduction in income for the UKA in Virginia,
and affected Hudgins' salary and expenses. Information
available does not indicate whether money for Hudgins' salary
and expenses obtained from UKA or his employer.

FBI Headquarters, in October, 1962, authorized
the preparation of an anonymous mineographed leaflet
criticizing individuals and small groups with communist
backgrounds who consistently attacked the United States
but never took a stand against the Soviet Union. This
was to be done in connection with the scheduled October 31,
1962, appearance of Herbert Eugene Aptheker, a member of
the National Committee, Communist Party, USA, at the
State University of New York at Buffalo (UB), as a part
of a lecture series entitled \"A Political Spectrum of a
Contemporary World.\" Such individuals had been openly
critical of an earlier appearance by a British fascist,

Authority was also granted to anonymously mail
public source information on Aptheker to Dr. Charles
Ebert, UB, a faculty member critical of the far left.

The leaflets were anonymously distributed to
the local news media, the student newspaper and to 28
campus organizations and/or students.

Aptheker's scheduled speech was deferred by
a last minute injunction in New York State Court. It
is not known if the leaflets or letter had any bearing
on the injunction. An appellate court later ruled the
University had the right to invite Aptheker to speak.

In August, 1963, the FBI in Seattle, Washington,
became avare that a factional problem existed in the
Communist Party (CP) Northwest District as a result of
the Sino-Soviet split in which the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA),
supported the Soviet Union.

A Red Chinese letter stating their position in
the ideological dispute was condensed; criticisms of the
CPUSA pro-Soviet position were added, and an anonymous letter
prepared and mailed to 25 selected CP members in the Northwest
District..

The Seattle FBI Office later reported that some
members of the Seattle area CP registered their disapproval
with the National CP pro-Soviet position and that this
contributed to some disharmony in CPUSA circles. The
letter was discussed at CP state and local club levels
in Seattle.

During May, 1967, a leaflet was mailed to about
40 individuals in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area. Recipients
were labor union leaders, churchmen, members of the American
Society of Friends, and the American Legion Posts in vicinity
of the residence of Arthur Edelman. Some of the recipients
were associated with Edelman in promoting demonstrations
against the war in Vietnam and the leaflet was designed
to present the membership and leadership role of Edelman
and his wife, Beth, in the Western Pennsylvania Communist
Party (CP).

Arthur Edelman, after being made aware of leaflet,
announced it was time to come out in the open. An informant
advised that Arthur Tuden, a college instructor in Pittsburgh,
who was active in the antiwar movement, commented he was.
considering being more circumspect in his dealings with
Edelman. Subsequent to circulation of leaflet, Edelman
claimed the organization Trade Unionists For Peace in
Pittsburgh was on verge of collapse because of friction
among its leaders.

During mid-1966, the New Orleans Office mailed a series of
letters to Assistant Grand Dragon Bill Windham, Louisiana United Klans
of America, Inc., in the name of a fictitious organization, The National
Committee for Domestic Tranquility (NCDT), an anti-Klan group. The
letters, which indicated that Windham was cooperating with NCDT, were
addressed in a manner that they would be intercepted by a Klan member
and furnished to another Klan leader.

Resulted in a split in Klan leadership and ultimately in
Windham's resignation from the Klan.

The Philadelphia FBI Office was authorized to mail an
anonymous letter to Robert Shelton, Imperial Wizard, United Klans
of America (UKA), Tuscaloosa, Alabama, from a \"member of the
Minutemen\" in Pennsylvania, urging that Shelton drop Roy Frankhouser
from Ku Klux Klan leadership in Pennsylvania. This letter would also
suggest that Pennsylvania authorities, although not true, were consider-
ing Frankhouser as a murder suspect at that time.

During March, 1967, Robert Shelton mentioned he had
dropped Frankhouser from membership in the UKA and that he had
written acknowledgment from Frankhouser of this fact.

The Philadelphia FBI Office during June, 1964,
mailed an anonymous letter, ostensibly prepared by a disgruntled
Communist Party (CP) youth in Philadelphia, to Gus Hall, General
Secretary, CPUSA, complaining about the domineering and over-
bearing attitude toward the CP youth on the part of Frances Gabow,
Organizational Secretary of the CP of Eastern Pennsylvania and
Delaware. The letter indicated Gabow had also lost the respect of
adult members because of her relationship with a married man.

Gabow lost her position as CP Organizational Secretary.

During August, 1968, the Los Angeles Office mailed
an anonymous letter to selected faculty associates of
Robert A. Nieman, an Assistant Professor at California
State College and a candidate for the Peace and Freedom
Party for the California Assembly. The letter ridiculed.
Nieman, pointing out that he was white, did not truly
represent the blacks, that he had been arrested for
possession of marijuana, and of his background with the
Students for a Democratic Society (SDB). Nieman was
very active in SDS and supported $DS in anti-Vietnam
War demonstrations. His arrest record, under FBI
Identification Number 274-688-G, reveals that he was
arrested by the Los Angeles, California, Police
Department, on 9/29/67 for violation of the Health and
Safety Code (Possession of Marijuana).

Nieman lost the election, which he said be
expected, but also stated that the letter had caused him
much embarrassment, both at the school, where an effort
was being made to remove him, and among black militants,
who in some cases were being taught by him.

A leaflet entitled \"Call...to Progressive-Minded
America Announcing the Holding of of a Conference Preliminary
to the Founding Convention of a New, American Labor-Negro
Vanguard Party\" in November, 1961, was sent anonymously by
the Newark Office to Communist Party (CP) officials throughout
the country. The aim was to hinder the formation of the
American Labor-Negro Vanguard Party (ALNVP) which was a
project of the Harriet-Tubman Section which had already
been expelled from the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA). It
was also to make the Harriet-Tubman Section appear as a
provocative agent of the FBI trying to raid the CPUSA of
its membership and financial support.

The mailing created considerable confusion in the
CPUSA, which found it necessary to warn its members through
its newspaper, of the formation of the ALNVP and to warn
against being taken in by this group.

During June, 1970, the Charlotte Office prepared
about 100 copies of a leaflet, in the form of a news item,
prepared by a reporter for Southern Vanguard Revolutionary
Party, (a defunct extremist organization formed by purged
Panther Jose Gonzalvez). The leaflet, sent to news services
and to a number of residents in the vicinity of Black
Panther Party (BPP) headquarters, Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, was intended to publicize the split in the
BPP group at Winston-Salem and to highlight that outside
leadership has been brought to the HPP Winston-Salem.
Leaflet mentioned Douglas Miranda, former BPP leader in
New Haven, Connecticut, had been transferred to Winston-
Salem and also attacked Larry Little, a BPP leader in
Winston-Salem, as radical and insinuated he is pocketing
donations obtained for BPP Breakfast for Children Program.
The leaflet contained truthful information..

After distribution of this leaflet, sales of the
BPP newspaper in Winston-Salem dropped considerably and
respect for BPP leaders in Winston-Salem was reported to
have been lost by members.

Douglas Paul Miranda was a successful leader and
organizer of the Black Panther Party (BPP) during 1969 and
1970 in New Haven, Connecticut. An anonymous letter was
sent to BPP Headquarters in San Francisco in March, 1970,
using BPP slang alleging that Miranda had embezzled BPP
funds and questioned whether his promiscuity was in the best
interest of the BPP. There was no specific information
known to the FBI that Miranda was, in fact, embezzling BPP
funds, but allegations had been received that he was having
sexual relations with numerous females in the Now Haven
area.

Miranda fell into disfavor with the BPP leadership
and disciplinary action was taken with the approval of the
national office. He was transferred to Winston-Salem,
North Carolina.

At your request there is attached a memorandum
summarizing known results in our Cointelpros directed against the
Communist Party, USA, Socialiot Workers Party, White Hate
Groups, New Left and Black Extremists. These summaries do
not indicate any actions were conducted under these programs
which resulted in physical injury to the targets or that electronic
techniques, surreptitious entries, or mail openings were used in
connection with Cointelpro actions.

The Attorney General

NOTE:
The Attorney General, on 8/8/75, and the Deputy
Attorney General, met with Associate Director Nicholas P. Callahan,
Assistant Director W. Kaymond Wannall, and Inspector John B. Hotis
to discuss the request of the Senate Select Committee for the identities
of sources utilized to effect Cointelpro activities. The Attorney General
indicated prior to discussing this problem, which relates to the over-
all confidentiality of FBI sources, with Senator Church, Chairman of
the Committee, he desired to be furnished information which would
enable him to insure himself there were no Cointelpro activities of a
scandalous or infamous nature which at a later date could cause em-
barrassment to the Department. The attached memorandum was
prepared during the period 8/8-12/75 by personnel of the Internal
Security Branch of the Intelligence Division. It represents a careful
review of all Cointelpro actions where results were known. It is
pointed out in the majority of authorized Cointelpro actions results
were not recorded. Also, because of the wide variety of Cointelpro
actions, results in many areas are not subject to measurement. For
example, there is no way of determining how many individuals left the
Communist Party as a result of our documented mailings relating to
Soviet anti-semitism,

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS

Classified because sets forth information which,
if disclosed, could compromise sensitive intel-
ligence sources and methods.

In an effort to assess possible damage incurred by
subversive and extremist organizations and individuals as a result of
Counter intelligence Program (Cointelpro) activity, a current review
has been made of the programs relating to the Communist Party, USA,
Socialist Workers Party, White Hate Groups, New Left and Black
Extremists.

The \"Study Committee Report on FBI Counterintelligence
Programs,\" prepared in May, 1974, by the Department-FBI Committee
headed by former Assistant Attorney General Henry E. Petersen, tabu-
lated 3, 208 proposals for counterintelligence action during the period
1956 until all programs were discontinued on April 28, 1971. Of these,
according to the Petersen report, 2,340 were reported approved and im-

In July, 1964, an anonymous letter was sent to
a number of individuals in the Superior, Wisconsin, area
who advertised in \"Tyomies-Eteenpain,\" a Finnish language
newspaper published in Wisconsin noting the similarity
of editorials in \"The Worker,\" published by the Communist
Party, USA, to alert these advertisers to the communist
nature of this newspaper so they might withdraw their
support.
:

There was no known withdrawal of support for
this newspaper, but at the same time, the newspaper was
applying for membership in the Superior, Wisconsin,
Chamber of Commerce and their application was denied.

In December, 1969, an anonymous letter was directed
to selected members of the United Klans of America, Inc. (UKA),
by the Richmond Office. This letter denounced Robert H.
Hudgins, Grand Dragon of Virginia, characterizing him as one
interested in personal gain only. The content of the letter
suggested that it had been prepared by Raymond Adams, a
former UKA member, who had been banished and had been at
odds with Hudgins.

The anonymous mailing resulted in continuing
disruption and mistrust in certain Klan units. Hudgins'
leadership was challenged. The unrest at Danville, Virginia,
caused a great reduction in income for the UKA in Virginia,
and affected Hudgins' salary and expenses. Information
available does not indicate whether money for Hudgins' salary
and expenses obtained from UKA or his employer.

FBI Headquarters, in October, 1962, authorized
the preparation of an anonymous mineographed leaflet
criticizing individuals and small groups with communist
backgrounds who consistently attacked the United States
but never took a stand against the Soviet Union. This
was to be done in connection with the scheduled October 31,
1962, appearance of Herbert Eugene Aptheker, a member of
the National Committee, Communist Party, USA, at the
State University of New York at Buffalo (UB), as a part
of a lecture series entitled \"A Political Spectrum of a
Contemporary World.\" Such individuals had been openly
critical of an earlier appearance by a British fascist,

Authority was also granted to anonymously mail
public source information on Aptheker to Dr. Charles
Ebert, UB, a faculty member critical of the far left.

The leaflets were anonymously distributed to
the local news media, the student newspaper and to 28
campus organizations and/or students.

Aptheker's scheduled speech was deferred by
a last minute injunction in New York State Court. It
is not known if the leaflets or letter had any bearing
on the injunction. An appellate court later ruled the
University had the right to invite Aptheker to speak.

In August, 1963, the FBI in Seattle, Washington,
became avare that a factional problem existed in the
Communist Party (CP) Northwest District as a result of
the Sino-Soviet split in which the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA),
supported the Soviet Union.

A Red Chinese letter stating their position in
the ideological dispute was condensed; criticisms of the
CPUSA pro-Soviet position were added, and an anonymous letter
prepared and mailed to 25 selected CP members in the Northwest
District..

The Seattle FBI Office later reported that some
members of the Seattle area CP registered their disapproval
with the National CP pro-Soviet position and that this
contributed to some disharmony in CPUSA circles. The
letter was discussed at CP state and local club levels
in Seattle.

During May, 1967, a leaflet was mailed to about
40 individuals in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area. Recipients
were labor union leaders, churchmen, members of the American
Society of Friends, and the American Legion Posts in vicinity
of the residence of Arthur Edelman. Some of the recipients
were associated with Edelman in promoting demonstrations
against the war in Vietnam and the leaflet was designed
to present the membership and leadership role of Edelman
and his wife, Beth, in the Western Pennsylvania Communist
Party (CP).

Arthur Edelman, after being made aware of leaflet,
announced it was time to come out in the open. An informant
advised that Arthur Tuden, a college instructor in Pittsburgh,
who was active in the antiwar movement, commented he was.
considering being more circumspect in his dealings with
Edelman. Subsequent to circulation of leaflet, Edelman
claimed the organization Trade Unionists For Peace in
Pittsburgh was on verge of collapse because of friction
among its leaders.

During mid-1966, the New Orleans Office mailed a series of
letters to Assistant Grand Dragon Bill Windham, Louisiana United Klans
of America, Inc., in the name of a fictitious organization, The National
Committee for Domestic Tranquility (NCDT), an anti-Klan group. The
letters, which indicated that Windham was cooperating with NCDT, were
addressed in a manner that they would be intercepted by a Klan member
and furnished to another Klan leader.

Resulted in a split in Klan leadership and ultimately in
Windham's resignation from the Klan.

The Philadelphia FBI Office was authorized to mail an
anonymous letter to Robert Shelton, Imperial Wizard, United Klans
of America (UKA), Tuscaloosa, Alabama, from a \"member of the
Minutemen\" in Pennsylvania, urging that Shelton drop Roy Frankhouser
from Ku Klux Klan leadership in Pennsylvania. This letter would also
suggest that Pennsylvania authorities, although not true, were consider-
ing Frankhouser as a murder suspect at that time.

During March, 1967, Robert Shelton mentioned he had
dropped Frankhouser from membership in the UKA and that he had
written acknowledgment from Frankhouser of this fact.

The Philadelphia FBI Office during June, 1964,
mailed an anonymous letter, ostensibly prepared by a disgruntled
Communist Party (CP) youth in Philadelphia, to Gus Hall, General
Secretary, CPUSA, complaining about the domineering and over-
bearing attitude toward the CP youth on the part of Frances Gabow,
Organizational Secretary of the CP of Eastern Pennsylvania and
Delaware. The letter indicated Gabow had also lost the respect of
adult members because of her relationship with a married man.

Gabow lost her position as CP Organizational Secretary.

During August, 1968, the Los Angeles Office mailed
an anonymous letter to selected faculty associates of
Robert A. Nieman, an Assistant Professor at California
State College and a candidate for the Peace and Freedom
Party for the California Assembly. The letter ridiculed.
Nieman, pointing out that he was white, did not truly
represent the blacks, that he had been arrested for
possession of marijuana, and of his background with the
Students for a Democratic Society (SDB). Nieman was
very active in SDS and supported $DS in anti-Vietnam
War demonstrations. His arrest record, under FBI
Identification Number 274-688-G, reveals that he was
arrested by the Los Angeles, California, Police
Department, on 9/29/67 for violation of the Health and
Safety Code (Possession of Marijuana).

Nieman lost the election, which he said be
expected, but also stated that the letter had caused him
much embarrassment, both at the school, where an effort
was being made to remove him, and among black militants,
who in some cases were being taught by him.

NOTE: SL 1495-E (former) (Bureau file 134-19686) was operated
from January, 1970, to approximately September, 1971,
primarily targeted against White Hate Groups. In 1971, he traveled
to Savannah, Georgia, at which time he reported on activities of the
National States Rights Party office and that Jerry Ray, brother of
James Earl Ray, stated he knew there was another party involved in
the killing of King and that his brother was the one who pulled the
trigger. This is the apparent HSCA interest in informant.

Referenced communications concern previous informal
requests by the HSCA that we contact SL 1495-E to determine if he
would be willing to be interviewed by the Committee. St. Louis con-
tacted informant on 1/27/78 and he agreed, but two days later submitted
a letter to St. Louis declining to be interviewed by the HSCA. Subse-
quently, the HSCA determined informant's identity through its investi-
gation and contacted him, at which time, according to the HSCA, he
agreed to interview. By letter to the Attorney General dated 1/26/78,
the HSCA has asked for all information at FBI Headquarters and in
the field concerning informant.

This matter has been coordinated with SA D. O. Coulson,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division,
and SA M. V. Hale, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal
Investigative Division.

NOTE The HSCA plans to submit a formal request regarding
this matter, but requested informant be contacted for his
initial reaction to interview. The Congressional Inquiry Unit,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit and Mr. Robert L.
Keuch, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
agree this approach is best prior to continuing discussions
to resolve legal and other issues.

The.
The apparent interest of the HSCA involves informant's
travel to Savannah, Georgia, in 1971 at which time he reported
on activities at the NSRP Office in Savannah, as set forth in
referenced communication. Informant reported that Jerry Ray,
brother of. James Earl Ray, and J. B. Stoner, National Chairman,
NSRP, were in the office when Jerry said that the FBI and he
knew there was another party involved in the killing of King
and that his brother was the one who pulled the trigger.
The HSCA has requested FBI information on the NSRP, Stoner,
Jerry Ray and other individuals identified as being in attendance
in the NSRP Office in Savannah during that time. One of the
individuals present, Richard Geppert, was later developed
as an informant of the Springfield Office. Geppert has been
interviewed by the HSCA and has furnished a signed statement
in which he gives authority for HSCA review of all FBI
information concerning him, including that pertaining to his
confidential relationship with the FBI.

This matter has been coordinated with Legal Liaison and
Congressional Affairs Unit and the Organized Crime Section,

NOTE: SL 1495-E (former) (Bureau file 134-19686) was operated
from January, 1970, to approximately September, 1971,

primarily targeted against White Hate Groups. In 1971, he traveled
to Savannah, Georgia, at which time he reported on activities of the

National States Rights Party office and that Jerry Ray, brother of
James Earl Ray, stated he knew there was another party involved in

the killing of King and that his brother was the one who pulled the
trigger. This is the apparent HSCA interest in informant.

Referenced communications concern previous informal
requests by the HSCA that we contact SL 1495-E to determine if he

would be willing to be interviewed by the Committee. St. Louis con-
tacted informant on 1/27/78 and he agreed, but two days later submitted

a letter to St. Louis declining to be interviewed by the HSCA. Subse-
quently, the HSCA determined informant's identity through its investi-

gation and contacted him, at which time, according to the HSCA, he
agreed to interview. By letter to the Attorney General dated 1/26/78,

the HSCA has asked for all information at FBI Headquarters and in
the field concerning informant.

This matter has been coordinated with SA D. O. Coulson,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division,

and SA M. V. Hale, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal
Investigative Division.

travel to Savannah, Georgia, in 1971 at which time he reported

on activities at the NSRP Office in Savannah, as set forth in
referenced communication. Informant reported that Jerry Ray,

brother of. James Earl Ray, and J. B. Stoner, National Chairman,
NSRP, were in the office when Jerry said that the FBI and he

knew there was another party involved in the killing of King
and that his brother was the one who pulled the trigger.

HSCA has requested FBI information on the NSRP, Stoner,
Jerry Ray and other individuals identified as being in attendance

in the NSRP Office in Savannah during that time. One of the
individuals present, Richard Geppert, was later developed

as an informant of the Springfield Office. Geppert has been
interviewed by the HSCA and has furnished a signed statement

in which he gives authority for HSCA review of all FBI
information concerning him, including that pertaining to his

confidential relationship with the FBI.

This matter has been coordinated with Legal Liaison and
Congressional Affairs Unit and the Organized Crime Section,

NOTE: SL 1495-E (former) (Bureau file 134-19686) was operated
from January, 1970, to approximately September, 1971,
primarily targeted against White Hate Groups. In 1971, he traveled
to Savannah, Georgia, at which time he reported on activities of the
National States Rights Party office and that Jerry Ray, brother of
James Earl Ray, stated he knew there was another party involved in
the killing of King and that his brother was the one who pulled the
trigger. This is the apparent HSCA interest in informant.

Referenced communications concern previous informal
requests by the HSCA that we contact SL 1495-E to determine if he
would be willing to be interviewed by the Committee. St. Louis con-
tacted informant on 1/27/78 and he agreed, but two days later submitted
a letter to St. Louis declining to be interviewed by the HSCA. Subse-
quently, the HSCA determined informant's identity through its investi-
gation and contacted him, at which time, according to the HSCA, he
agreed to interview. By letter to the Attorney General dated 1/26/78,
the HSCA has asked for all information at FBI Headquarters and in
the field concerning informant.

This matter has been coordinated with SA D. O. Coulson,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division,
and SA M. V. Hale, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal
Investigative Division.

CONSIDERED OR CARRIED OUT AGAINST KING OR THE SCLC BY THE NEW

NOTE The HSCA plans to submit a formal request regarding
this matter, but requested informant be contacted for his
initial reaction to interview. The Congressional Inquiry Unit,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit and Mr. Robert L.
Keuch, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
agree this approach is best prior to continuing discussions
to resolve legal and other issues.

The.
The apparent interest of the HSCA involves informant's
travel to Savannah, Georgia, in 1971 at which time he reported
on activities at the NSRP Office in Savannah, as set forth in
referenced communication. Informant reported that Jerry Ray,
brother of. James Earl Ray, and J. B. Stoner, National Chairman,
NSRP, were in the office when Jerry said that the FBI and he
knew there was another party involved in the killing of King
and that his brother was the one who pulled the trigger.
The HSCA has requested FBI information on the NSRP, Stoner,
Jerry Ray and other individuals identified as being in attendance
in the NSRP Office in Savannah during that time. One of the
individuals present, Richard Geppert, was later developed
as an informant of the Springfield Office. Geppert has been
interviewed by the HSCA and has furnished a signed statement
in which he gives authority for HSCA review of all FBI
information concerning him, including that pertaining to his
confidential relationship with the FBI.

This matter has been coordinated with Legal Liaison and
Congressional Affairs Unit and the Organized Crime Section,

NOTE: SL 1495-E (former) (Bureau file 134-19686) was operated
from January, 1970, to approximately September, 1971,
primarily targeted against White Hate Groups. In 1971, he traveled
to Savannah, Georgia, at which time he reported on activities of the
National States Rights Party office and that Jerry Ray, brother of
James Earl Ray, stated he knew there was another party involved in
the killing of King and that his brother was the one who pulled the
trigger. This is the apparent HSCA interest in informant.

Referenced communications concern previous informal
requests by the HSCA that we contact SL 1495-E to determine if he
would be willing to be interviewed by the Committee. St. Louis con-
tacted informant on 1/27/78 and he agreed, but two days later submitted
a letter to St. Louis declining to be interviewed by the HSCA. Subse-
quently, the HSCA determined informant's identity through its investi-
gation and contacted him, at which time, according to the HSCA, he
agreed to interview. By letter to the Attorney General dated 1/26/78,
the HSCA has asked for all information at FBI Headquarters and in
the field concerning informant.

This matter has been coordinated with SA D. O. Coulson,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division,
and SA M. V. Hale, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal
Investigative Division.

NOTE The HSCA plans to submit a formal request regarding
this matter, but requested informant be contacted for his
initial reaction to interview. The Congressional Inquiry Unit,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit and Mr. Robert L.
Keuch, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
agree this approach is best prior to continuing discussions
to resolve legal and other issues.

The.
The apparent interest of the HSCA involves informant's
travel to Savannah, Georgia, in 1971 at which time he reported
on activities at the NSRP Office in Savannah, as set forth in
referenced communication. Informant reported that Jerry Ray,
brother of. James Earl Ray, and J. B. Stoner, National Chairman,
NSRP, were in the office when Jerry said that the FBI and he
knew there was another party involved in the killing of King
and that his brother was the one who pulled the trigger.
The.
HSCA has requested FBI information on the NSRP, Stoner,
Jerry Ray and other individuals identified as being in attendance
in the NSRP Office in Savannah during that time. One of the
individuals present, Richard Geppert, was later developed
as an informant of the Springfield Office. Geppert has been
interviewed by the HSCA and has furnished a signed statement
in which he gives authority for HSCA review of all FBI
information concerning him, including that pertaining to his
confidential relationship with the FBI.

This matter has been coordinated with Legal Liaison and
Congressional Affairs Unit and the Organized Crime Section,

Reference is made to the December 18, 1975, letter
of the SSC as modified at a conference on December 30, 1975,
between Messrs. W. O. Cregar and P. V. Daly of this Bureau
and Committee Staff Members Michael Epstein and Mark Gitenstein.

This memorandum effects delivery of material in
response to Items 1, 1(a), 1(b), and 1(e). The matters
referred to are four FBI investigations about which the SSC
was previously furnished materials relating to FBI preventive
actions.

Concerning Item 1, which requested reports or letter-
head memoranda (LHis) disseminated outside the Bureau by FBI
Headquarters (FBIHQ), for the six-month period preceding the
act of violence prevented, the following is noted. In regard
to the incidents involving the proposed assassination of a
narcotics agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the planned racial
violence in Cleveland, Ohio, there were no reports or LHMs
submitted by either the Minneapolis Field Office or Cleveland
Field Office during the six-month period preceding the incident.

U. S. Senate Select Committee

Concerning Item 1(a), which requested predications
for each investigation, it should be noted that in the incident
involving the proposed assassination of a narcotics agent, there
was no predication submitted by the Minneapolis Field Office.
This was due to the fact that there was no FBI jurisdiction
concerning this matter and consequently no investigation by the
FBI.

Concerning Item 1(b), which requested the first
investigative report or LH disseminated by FBIHQ outside the
FBI in each case, and a list of recipients of that report or
LIM, the following should be noted. Regarding the incident
involving the proposed assassination of a narcotics agent, no
report or LHLi was submitted by the Minneapolis Field Office as
there was no FBI investigation. On the administrative pages
accompanying reports or Lil's involving the other incidents,
thore are notations which identify those agencies which received
copies of these documents.

Item 1(e), requested annual reports or LI's from the
Office of Origin to FBINQ for the last five years during which
each case was an open (pending) investigation. Regarding the
incidents involving the Hanafi Muslim sect in Washington, D. C.,
the proposed assassination of a narcotics agent in Minneapolis,
kiinnesota, and the planned racial violence in Cleveland, Chio,
no annual reports or Lihis were submitted by either the Washington,
Cleveland, or Minneapolis Field Office.

Reference is made to the oral request of Special
Assistant to the Attorney General Jack W. Fuller, October 20,
1975, for information concerning six individuals whose names
were placed on the National Security Agency (NSA) Watch List
because of FBI investigative interest in them.

In response to that request, enclosed are the
original and one copy each of six memoranda relating to the
following individuals:

2. Stokely Carmichael
1. Kathie Boudin
3. Howard Lamar Fuller
4. Leonard Handelsman
5. Naomi Esther JaffeEX 103
6. Saifeldine Ahmed Abdenabi Wadi-Ramahi.

The memoranda include information as to the reasons
why these individuals were investigated by the FBI, included
on the Watch List and the use made of the product received
from NSA concerning them, if any. Regarding those individuals
on whom there is no record of receipt of information of a
positive nature from NSA, it should be noted that it was our
practice to destroy upon receipt any Watch List \"product\" which
did not appear to be of significance in our investigations_and
to retain neither copies nor record of receipt.

NOTE:

On 10/20/75, Mr. Jack Marsh of the White House
contacted Jack Fuller, supra, concerning this matter and
Mr. Fuller requested that we select six individuals who had
been included on the Watch List and furnish the requested
information for possible use at an Executive Session of the
SSC. On 10/20/75, Mr. Dave Lohman, NSA, advised Supervisor
J. P. Thomas, INTD, that NSA was aware that we were going
to receive this request; that there was no need, from NSA's
standpoint, for classification of response merely because
it stated that certain persons were on the Watch List. He
stated NSA intended to tell the SSC the number of requests
it had received from other agencies, including FBI, to put
names on the Watch List but that NSA had told Jack Marsh, supra,
that specific names would have to be furnished by the agencies
interested in the particular subjects.

Kathie Boudin is being sought by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation as a fugitive in connection with
her unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, for mob action
and for violation of Federal Anti-Riot Laws, the National
Firearms Act, and Bombing Matters. She is being sought
as a Weatherman fugitive. Weatherman is a violence-prone
organization of Marxist ideology which operates an
operates
underground movement for the purpose of committing acts
of terrorism. Weatherman members have been known to
travel abroad and were suspected of maintaining a system
of international communications.

Boudin's nane was furnished the National
Security Agency by communication dated April 16, 1973,
along with names of other individuals affiliated with
the Weatherman organization. During 1973, a source who
had furnished reliable information in the past advised
he observed in Havana, Cuba, an individual whom he
believed to be identical with Boudin. A second source
who had furnished reliable information in the past
advised Leonard Boudin, Kathie's father, had made a
statement that Kathie Boudin was in Cuba.

There was no indication any information of a
positive nature was received from the National Security
Agency concerning Boudin.

STOKELY CARMICHAEL

Assoc. Dir.
Dep. AD Adm.
Stokely Carmichael is a well-known and publicly
identified black extremist. Carmichael, during the approximate
period 1967 to present, has openly called for revolution
by blacks and the destruction of capitalism in America through
violent action.

Carmichael was among individuals of investigative
interest who were placed on the National Security Agency's (NSA)
Watchlist because of his extremist activities and contacts
which include both domestic and foreign personalities of similar
persuasion.

In addition to maintaining his residence in Guinea
and frequent trips to the United States, Carmichael has also
traveled to North Vietnam, Cuba and People's Republic of China.
Information furnished the Federal Bureau of Investigation by
IISA included data concerning his foreign travel, his visits to
the United States, travel of associates to visit him in Guinea
and invitations to attend various international conferences.

This information received from NSA, in some instances,
was furnished appropriate FBI Field Offices to assist this
Bureau's investigation in following the travel and extremist
activities of Cermichael.

Handelsman was sought by the FBI as a fugitive in
connection with Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution for
Mob Action, Aggravated Battery, and Aiding Escape. He had
also been charged with Conspiracy for Possession of
Unregistered Firearms and Interstate Transportation of
Explosives and Incendiary Devices. Handelsman was sought
as a Weatherman fugitive. Weatherman is violence-prone
organization of Marsist ideology which operates an under-
ground movement for the purpose of committing acts of

NOTE: SL 1495-E (former) (Bureau file 134-19686) was operated
from January, 1970, to approximately September, 1971,
primarily targeted against White Hate Groups. In 1971, he traveled
to Savannah, Georgia, at which time he reported on activities of the
National States Rights Party office and that Jerry Ray, brother of
James Earl Ray, stated he knew there was another party involved in
the killing of King and that his brother was the one who pulled the
trigger. This is the apparent HSCA interest in informant.

Referenced communications concern previous informal
requests by the HSCA that we contact SL 1495-E to determine if he
would be willing to be interviewed by the Committee. St. Louis con-
tacted informant on 1/27/78 and he agreed, but two days later submitted
a letter to St. Louis declining to be interviewed by the HSCA. Subse-
quently, the HSCA determined informant's identity through its investi-
gation and contacted him, at which time, according to the HSCA, he
agreed to interview. By letter to the Attorney General dated 1/26/78,
the HSCA has asked for all information at FBI Headquarters and in
the field concerning informant.

This matter has been coordinated with SA D. O. Coulson,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division,
and SA M. V. Hale, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal
Investigative Division.

NOTE The HSCA plans to submit a formal request regarding
this matter, but requested informant be contacted for his
initial reaction to interview. The Congressional Inquiry Unit,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit and Mr. Robert L.
Keuch, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
agree this approach is best prior to continuing discussions
to resolve legal and other issues.

The.
The apparent interest of the HSCA involves informant's
travel to Savannah, Georgia, in 1971 at which time he reported
on activities at the NSRP Office in Savannah, as set forth in
referenced communication. Informant reported that Jerry Ray,
brother of. James Earl Ray, and J. B. Stoner, National Chairman,
NSRP, were in the office when Jerry said that the FBI and he
knew there was another party involved in the killing of King
and that his brother was the one who pulled the trigger.
The HSCA has requested FBI information on the NSRP, Stoner,
Jerry Ray and other individuals identified as being in attendance
in the NSRP Office in Savannah during that time. One of the
individuals present, Richard Geppert, was later developed
as an informant of the Springfield Office. Geppert has been
interviewed by the HSCA and has furnished a signed statement
in which he gives authority for HSCA review of all FBI
information concerning him, including that pertaining to his
confidential relationship with the FBI.

This matter has been coordinated with Legal Liaison and

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams MDR 16 DATE: 7/3/75

FROM : Legal Counsel ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE BY SP2
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

At 9:55 a.m. on July 3, 1975, former Assistant Director
Ivan Conrad telephonically advised me that he has been contacted and
requested to appear for interview by the Senate Select Committee during
the week of July 7, 1975, concerning Martin Luther King. Mr. Conrad
expressed great concern about his appearance for such an interview and
requested guidance.

I told him that the Director was cooperating with the Committee
in their inquiry, but that in regard to matters that would identify informants,
affect current operations, or compromise very sensitive techniques any
testimony may require limitation to members of the Committee or to the
Chairman rather than staff interviewers.

Mr. Conrad then asked whether he should respond in the
event questions were raised concerning sensitive matters regarding the
U.S. mails. I told him that in the event questions were asked which
appeared to be beyond the scope of the subject matter indicated for the
interview, or which in his judgment would involve the three areas of
concern expressed above, it would be appropriate for him to request a
recess for the purpose of consulting with the Bureau.

Mr. Conrad inquired as to his possible criminal liability and
whether the FBI would furnish him counsel. I explained to him the difficulties
imposed by conflicts of interest in that regard and that the FBI could not
furnish him personal counsel. I told him that if he felt the need for advice
as to his personal status, he should consider obtaining the services of a
personal counsel. He said that he would consider that and that although he
was specifically not making a request at this time, he would consider in the
future requesting that the Bureau pay for his private counsel

Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. Conrad was cordial and said he understood fully that
I was not in a position to furnish him legal advice. I suggested that he
contact the Bureau prior to his appearance for the interview in order to be
advised formally as to his release from the Bureau employment agreement
concerning secrecy and he agreed.

This is to record inquiry received from Mr. Leon
Ulman, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal
Counsel, and recommend response to him.

On 7/22/75, Mr. Ulman called Assistant Director -
Legal Counsel J.A. Mintz to request assistance concerning
an assignment he had been given by the Attorney General (AG)
relating to the current investigation being conducted by the
Senate Select Committee (SSC). In accordance with Mr. Mintz'
referral to our Senstudy project group, Mr. Ulman was contacted
7/22/75 by Supervisor J. P. Thomas. Mr. Ulman said that the
AG had requested his office to prepare, by 7/25/75, the fullest
possible response to the question, \"To what extent has the AG
been involved in consideration or approval of policies and
activities of U.S. foreign and military intelligence agencies?\"
Mr. Ulman said that he had requested the Criminal Division
of the Department to conduct research on this matter but, being
unfamiliar with foreign intelligence matters, desired to know
whether we could in any way assist him. He was informed that
the FBI is basically not a U.S. foreign intelligence agency.
He responded that some of our operations involve foreign
intelligence and again asked if we could assist. He was told
that we certainly could not furnish any full answer, but would
attempt to see if we could contribute something to his assign-
ment. It was also suggested to Mr. REC-102 Ulman that he consider
contacting Mr. K. William O'Connor, who is coordinating many
aspects of the SSC investigation for the Department, and might
be able to clarify the request or contribute to the response
and that he consider contacting CIA. He indicated he did not
feel that contact with CIA would be productive. It was agithe28 1975
that the inquiry appears to relate to the AG institutionally
rather than to any involvement of the incumbent, Mr. Levi

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Inquiry of Intelligence Division personnel, who
might have pertinent information, developed the following
information which might be offered to Mr. Ulman: (1) The
only specific instance in which we are aware that the AG is
involved in consideration or approval of activities of the
FBI regarding foreign intelligence is that when we desire to
effect electronic coverage, for ourselves or on request of
another agency, for the purpose of obtaining positive foreign
intelligence information or foreign counterintelligence
purposes, we seek the approval of the AG. Other agencies
might do likewise. (2) The National Security Act of 1947,
approved by the President 7/26/47, created the National Security
Council (NSC). NSC Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 1 was
revised on 7/7/49 and added the FBI as a member of the
Intelligence Advisory Committee (IAC). By a subsequent revision
of NSCID No. 1 on 9/15/58, IAC became the United States
Intelligence Board (USTB), with the FBI still a member. USIB
concerns itself with foreign intelligence matters. However,
inasmuch as the FBI itself is a member of USIB, and historically
the FBI has not coordinated USIB matters with the AG the
Bureau's role in USIB is not considered pertinent to the
inquiry regarding the involvement of the AG in foreign intelligence
matters. (3) Our records indicate that prior to the establishment
of the NSC, former FBI Director Hoover recommended that the
AG be a member of the committee which later became the NSC.
Apparently the National Security Act of 1947 did provide for
the AG to attend NSC meetings as a member if the President so
desired. Our records indicate the AG did attend some NSC
meetings as a member during the 1947-48 period. However, by
memorandum 8/19/49, AAG Peyton Ford informed Mr. Hoover that
the AG could no longer attend NSC meetings as a member because
of the amendment to the National Security Act made by Section 3
of Public Law 216, 81st Congress, approved 8/10/49. (4) On
11/5/71, the White House announced the establishment of the

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

National Security Council Intelligence Committee (NSCIC)
with the AG as a member. The President's 11/5/71 memorandum
stated the NSCIC \"will give direction and guidance on national
substantive intelligence needs and provide for a continuing
evaluation of intelligence products from the viewpoint of the
intelligence consumer.\" Assistant AG Robert Mardian attended
a meeting of NSCIC on 12/14/71 as the AG's representative.
We cannot document it, but the recollection of FBI personnel
involved in NSCIC affairs is that Mr. Mardian reported thereafter
to the AG that NSCIC activities did not concern the Department
and that neither the AG nor Mardian were subsequently involved
in NSCIC affairs. On 4/24/74, the AG was still listed as a
member of NSCIC. However, in August, 1974, FBI inquiry of a
member of the U. S. intelligence committee staff elicited the
opinion that the AG was no longer considered to be a member
of NSCIC because the AG's office had not been participating in
NSCIC affairs or attending its meetings; further, the AG was
not among the addressees of papers being sent out in preparation
for the next NSCIC meeting. However, it appears that the AG
may still be nominally listed as a member of NSCIC. (5) It
might also be useful for Mr. Ulman to consult Mr. Kevin Maroney
of the Internal Security Section of the Department inasmuch as
Mr. Maroney has long been involved in matters relating to
internal security and foreign intelligence, and may be aware
of the extent of the AG's involvement.

ACTION:

Delivered to Ullman
7/24/75.8
With your approval, Office of Legal Counsel will
convey the information in the preceding paragraph to Mr. Ulman,
who said he can be contacted by telephone on 187-2051. He
requested an expeditious response.

INTRODUCTION

Although the term \"revolutionary protest
movement\" cannot be precisely defined because of the
amorphous nature of such movements, it can be said
that revolutionary protest movements existing within the
United States fall into two broad categories, i.e. the...
New Left movement and the black extremist movement.

The New Left movement, which grew out of the
civil rights struggle of the 1950s, is a loose-knit,
undisciplined group of individuals who view our system of
government as irredeemably corrupt and oppressive. Their
stated aims and objectives are simple; they are dedicated
to the total destruction of our traditional values and
democratic system of government.

The New Left movement in this country is.clearly.
an integral part of a world-wide revolutionary movement of
students and young intellectuals. There is a definite
similarity of goals, a uniformity of action from country to
country, and a rapport among leftist organizations and
individuals in this and foreign countries:

Like the. New Left movement, the black extremist
movement in the United States can be traced to the civil rights
movement of the early 1960s and the violent response to civil
rights agitation. This is best seen in the history of the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), formed in
1960 in Atlanta, Georgia. SNCC was one of the moving forces
behind the Freedom Riders of the early 1960s and was the target
of Ku Klux Klan violence. In May,
elected chairman of SNCC. The lack of progress toward integrat
since the 1954 school desegregation decision helped
to. change. SNCC from a nonviolent group to a full-blown. black
revolutionary organization. Other black nationalists took up
cry for a \"bloody revolution\" and a proliferation
of black extremist groups seized the initiative for change frcz
established civil rights organizations and now

Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 in a
troubled time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
law enforcement administrator in charge of the Kansas City
Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as
a Special Agent of the FBI have made him uniquely qualified
to lead the Bureau.

The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation

10
extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over

11
the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the

12
openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and

13
their willingness to consider the need for legislation to

14
clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.

15
It is important to remember from the outset that this

16
Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's

17
activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic

admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative

21
of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic

The Committee has also concentrated on the past rather

Kelley took charge.

2
The Staff has advised the Committee that under Director

3
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous

4
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The

5
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli-

6
gence operations, and less on purely domestic surveillance.

7
The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in

8
developing policies and standards for intelligence. These
are welcome developments.

9

10
Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved.

11
Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the

12
Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress

13
should take into account in thinking about the future of
FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil-

14

15
lance should extend beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be

16

17
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certain
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance techniques;

18

19
whether foreign related intelligence activities should be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement

20

21
functions, and what should be done to the information already
in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in

22
the future.

23
The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange

24
of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CLARENCE M. KELLEY,

2
DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

3
Mr. Kelley. Thank you very much, Senator Church and

4
gentlemen.

5
I welcome the interest which this _Committee has shown in

6
the FBI and most particularly in our operations in the intelli-

7
gence and internal security fields.

I share your high regard for the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution and laws of the United States. Throughout my
35 year career in law enforcement you will find the same insis-
tence, as has been expressed by this Committee, upon programs
of law enforcement that are themselves fully consistent with
law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of legislative
oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment as Director of
the FBI and was being considered by the Senate Judiciary
Committee two and one half years ago, I told the members of
that Committee of my firm belief in Congressional oversight.
This Committee has completed the most exhaustive study
of our intelligence and security operations that has ever been
undertaken by anyone outside the FBI other than the present
Attorney General. At the outset, we pledged our fullest
cooperation and promised to be as candid and forthright as
possible in responding to your questions and complying with your
requests.

I believe we have lived up to those promises.

2
The members and staff of this Committee have had unprece-

3
dented access to FBI information.

4
You have talked to the personnel who conduct security-type

5
investigations and who are personally involved in every facet

6
of our day-to-day intelligence operations.

7
You have attended numerous briefings by FBI officials who

8
have sought to familiarize the Committee and its staff with

9
all major areas of our activities and operations in the national

10
security and intelligence fields.

11
In brief, you have had firsthand examination of these

12
matters that is unmatched at any time in the history of the

13
Congress.
I

14
As this Committee has stated, these hearings have, of

15
necessity, forcused largely on certain errors and abuses. I

16
credit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the

17
hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the FBI's

18
record of performance.

19
It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus

20
on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the

21
organization.

22
The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the

23
lion's share of public attention and critical comment constituted

24
an infinitesimal portion of our overall work.

25
A Justice Department Committee which was formed last year

1
to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's Counterintelligence

2
Programs has reported that in the five basic ones it found

3
3,247 Counterintelligence Programs were submitted to FBI

4
Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this total, 2,370,

5
less than three fourths, were approved.

6
I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247 proposals were

7.
being devised, considered, and many were rejected, in an era

8.
when the FBI was handling an average of 700,000 investigative

9
matters per year.

10
Nonetheless, the criticism which has been expressed

11
regarding the Counterintelligence Programs is most legitimate

12
and understandable.

13
The question might well be asked what I had in mind when

14
I stated last year that for the FBI to have done less than it

15
did under the circumstances then existing would have been an

16
abdication of its responsibilities to the American people..

17
What I said then, in 1974, and what I believe today, is

18
that the FBI employees involved in these programs did what they

19
felt was expected of them by the President, the Attorney General,

20
the Congress, and the people of the United States.

21
Bomb explosions rocked public and private offices and

22
buildings; rioters led by revolutionary extremists laid seige

23
to military, industrial, and educational facilities; and

24
killings, maimings, and other atrocities accompanied such

25
acts of violence from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings, men, women,

2 and children. As is the case in time of peril, whether real or
perceived, they looked to their Government, their elected and
appointed leadership, and to the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies to protect their lives, their property, and their
rights.

7
There were many calls for action from Members of Congress

8
9

10
and others, but few guidelines were furnished. The FBI and other
law enforcement agencies were besieged by demands, impatient
demands, for immediate action.

25
FBI employees recognized the danger; felt they had a
responsibility to respond; and in good faith initiated actions
designed to counter conspiratorial efforts of self-proclaimed
revolutionary groups, and to neutralize violent activities.

In the development and execution of these programs,
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.

Our concern over whatever abuses occurred in the Counter-
intelligence Programs, and there were some substantial ones,
should not obscure the underlying purpose of those programs.

We must recognize that situations have occurred in the
past and will arise in the future where the Government may well
be expected to depart from its traditional role, in the FBI's
case, as an investigative and intelligence-gathering
agency, and take affirmative steps which are needed to meet
an imminent threat to human life or property.

In short, if we learn a murder or bombing is to be carried

2
out now, can we truly meet our responsibilities by investigating

3
only after the crime has occurred, or should we have the

4
ability to prevent? I refer to those instances where there is

5
a strong sense of urgency because of an imminent threat to

6
human life.

7
Where there exists the potential to penetrate and disrupt,

8
the Congress must consider the question of whether or not such

9
preventive action should be available to the FBI.

10
These matters are currently being addressed by a task

11
force in the Justice Department, including the FBI,

12
and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and controls can

13

1.4
be developed in cooperation with pertinent Committees of Congress
to insure that such measures are used in an entirely responsible

manner.

Probably the most important question here today is what
assurances I can give that the errors and abuses which arose
under the Counterintelligence Programs will not occur again?

First, let me assure the Committee that some very sub-
stantial changes have been made in key areas of the FBI's
methods of operations since I took the oath of office as
Director on July 9, 1973.

Today we place a high premium on openness, openness
both within and without the service.

I have instituted a program of open, frank discussion

in the decision-making process which insures that no future
2 program or major policy decision will ever be adopted without a
2456

3
full and critical review of its propriety.

4
Participatory management has become a fact in the FBI.

5

6

7

8
I have made it known throughout our Headquarters and
Field Divisions that I welcome all employees, regardless of
position or degree of experience, to contribute their thoughts
and suggestions, and to voice whatever criticisms or

9
reservations they may have concerning any area of our operations.

25
The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine, and I take
full responsibility for them. My goal is to achieve maximum
critical analysis among our personnel without in any manner
weakening or undermining our basic command structure.

The results of this program have been most beneficial, to
me personally, to the FBI's disciplined performance, and to
the morale of our employees.

In addition, since some of the mistakes of the past
were occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities outside
the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward Levi's
guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability, in his
own words, \"as a 'lightning rod' to deflect improper requests.\"

Within days after taking office, Attorney General Levi
instructed that I immediately report to him any requests
or practices which, in my judgment, were improper or which,
considering the context of the request, I believed presented

2
I am pleased to report to this Committee as I have to the
2457

3
Attorney General that during my nearly two and one half years as

4
Director under two Presidents and three Attorneys General, no

5

6
one has approached me or made overtures, directly or otherwise,
to use the FBI for partisan political or other improper

purposes.
I can assure you that I would not for a moment consider
honoring any such request.

16
I can assure you, too, in my administration of the FBI
I routinely bring to the attention of the Attorney General and
the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions, including
those which arise in my continuing review of our operations and
practices. These are discussed openly and candidly in order
that the Attorney General can exercise his responsibilities
over the FBI.

17

18

19
I am convinced that the basic structure of the FBI today
is sound. But it would be a mistake to think that integrity
can be assured only through institutional means..

20

21

22
Integrity is a human quality. It depends upon the
character of the person who occupies the office of the
Director and every member of the FBI under him.

1 demand of themselves and expect of their associates are the

2
nation's ultimate assurance of proper and responsible conduct

3
at all times by the FBI.

4
The Congress and the members of this Committee in

5
particular have gained a great insight into the problems

6 confronting the FBI in the security and intelligence fields,

7
problems which all too often we have left to resolve without

8 sufficient guidance from the Executive Branch or the Congress

9
itself.

10
As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment have been

11
made. But no one who is looking for the cause of our

12
failures should confine his search solely to the FBI, or even

13
to the Executive Branch.

14
The Congress itself has long possessed the mechanism for

15
FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been exercised.

16
An initial step was taken in the Senate in 1973 when the

17
Committee on the Judiciary established a Subcommittee on FBI

18
Oversight. Hearings had been commenced, and we were fully

19
committed to maximum participation with the members of that

20
Subcommittee.

21
I laud their efforts. However, those efforts are of very

22
recent origin in terms of the FBI's history.

23
One of the greatest benefits of the study this Committee

24
has made is the expert knowledge you have gained of the complex

25
problems confronting the FBI. But I respectfully submit that
NW 88608 Docld:32989820 Page 19

smn 13
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

1
those benefits are wasted if they do not lead to the next step,
2459

2
a step that I believe is absolutely essential , a legislative

3
charter, expressing Congressional determination of intelligence

4
jurisdiction for the FBI.

5
Action to resolve the problems confronting us in the

6
security and intelligence fields is urgently needed; and it

7
must be undertaken in a forthright manner. Neither the Congress

8
nor the public can afford to look the other way, leaving it to

9
the FBI to do what must be done, as too often has occurred in

10
the past.

11
This means too that Congress must assume a continuing role

12
not in the initial decision-making process but in the review of

13
our performance.

14
I would caution against a too-ready reliance upon the

15
courts to do our tough thinking for us. Some proposals that

16
have been advanced during these hearings would extend the role

17
of the courts into the early stages of the investigative

18
process and, thereby, would take over what historically have

19
been Executive Branch decisions.

20
I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked, would

21
seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary and cast

23
22 them in a role not contemplated by the authors of our
Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a substitute for Con-

24
gressional oversight or Executive decision.

25
The FBI urgently needs a clear and workable determination

Senators, first and foremost, I am a police officer, a
career police officer. In my police experience, the must
frustrating of all problems that I have discovered facing
law enforcement in this country, Federal, state, and local, is
when demands are made of them to perform their traditional
role as protector of life and property without clear and
understandable legal bases to do so.
:

11

12
I recognize that the formulation of such a legislative
charter will be a most precise and demanding task.

13

14

15

16
It must be sufficiently flexible that it does not stifle
the FBI's effectiveness in combating the growing incidence
of crime and violence across the United States. That charter
must clearly address the demonstrated problems of the past;

17

18

19
yet, it must amply recognize the fact that times change and
so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive
`challenges.

20

21

22

23

24

25
The fact that the Department of Justice has commenced
the formulation of operational guidelines governing our
intelligence activities does not in any manner diminish the need
for legislation. The responsibility for conferring juris-
diction resides with the Congress.

In this regard, I am troubled by some proposals which

10
As a practical matter, the line between intelligence
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult
to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation may
well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But there
are some fundamental differences between these investigations
that should be recognized, differences in scope, in objective
and in the time of initiation. In the usual criminal case, a
crime has occurred and it remains only for the Government to
identify the perpetrator and to collect sufficient evidence
for prosecution. Since the investigation normally follows
the elements of the crime, the scope of the inquiry is
limited and fairly well defined.

16

24

25
By contrast, intelligence work involves the gathering of
information, not necessarily evidence. The purpose may well be
not to prosecute, but to thwart crime or to insure that the
Government has enough information to meet any future crisis
or emergency. The inquiry is necessarily broad because it
must tell us not only the nature of the threat, but also whether
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the
means by which the threat will be carried out. The ability
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent on
our anticipation of those criminal acts. Anticipation,

in turn, is dependent on advance information, that is, intelli-

2
gence.

3
Certainly, reasonable people can differ on these issues.

4
Given the opportunity, I am confident that the continuing need

5
for intelligence work can be documented to the full satisfaction

6
of the Congress. We recognize that what is at stake here is not

7
the interests of the FBI, but rather the interests of every

8
citizen of this country. We recognize also that the resolution

9
of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful

10
deliberation by the Congress. To this end, I pledge the

11
complete cooperation of the Bureau with this Committee or

12
its successors in this important task.

13

14
In any event, you have my unqualified assurance as
Director that we will carry out both the letter and the spirit

15
of such legislation as the Congress may enact.

16
That is the substance of my prepared statement.

17

18

19
I would also like to say extemporaneously that I note
that on this panel are some gentlemen who were on the Judiciary
Committee which heard my testimony at the time I was presented

20

21

22
to them for candidacy as Director of the FBI. At that time
I took very seriously the charge which may possibly result
in the deliberation of this Committee and of the full Senate.

25
I have been well aware of the problems of the FBI since that
time. I have also been well aware

Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 in a
troubled time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
law enforcement administrator in charge of the Kansas City
Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as
a Special Agent of the FBI have made him uniquely qualified
to lead the Bureau.
The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation
extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the
openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and
their willingness to consider the need for legislation to
clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.
It is important to remember from the outset that this
Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's
activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
intelligence operations. We have consistently expressed our
admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital importance
of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic
intelligence has raised many difficult questions.

Kelley took charge.
The Staff has advised the Committee that under Director
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli-
gence operations, and less on purely domestic surveillance.
The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in
developing policies and standards for intelligence. These
are welcome developments.
9
10
11

13
Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved.
Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the
Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress
should take into account in thinking about the future of
FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil-
14

lance should extend beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certain
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance techniques;
whether foreign related intelligence activities should be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement
functions, and what should be done to the information already
21
22
in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in
the future.
23
The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange
24
of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney

Mr. Kelley. Thank you very much, Senator Church and

I share your high regard for the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution and laws of the United States. Throughout my
35 year career in law enforcement you will find the same insis
tence, as has been expressed by this Committee, upon programs
of law enforcement that are themselves fully consistent with
law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of legislative
oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment as Director of
the FBI and was being considered by the Senate Judiciary
Committee two and one half years ago, I told the members of
that Committee of my firm belief in Congressional oversight.
This Committee has completed the most exhaustive study
of our intelligence and security operations that has ever been
undertaken by anyone outside the FBI other than the present
Attorney General. At the outset, we pledged our fullest
cooperation and promised to be as candid and forthright as
possible in responding to your questions and complying with your
requests.

dented access to FBI information.
You have talked to the personnel who conduct security-type
investigations and who are personally involved in every facet
of our day-to-day intelligence operations.

credit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the
hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the FBI's
record of performance.
It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus
on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the
organization.
The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the
lion's share of public attention and critical comment constituted
an infinitesimal portion of our overall work.

to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's Counterintelligence
Programs has reported that in the five basic ones it found
3,247 Counterintelligence Programs were submitted to FBI
Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this total, 2,370,
less than three fourths, were approved.
I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247 proposals were
being devised, considered, and many were rejected, in an era
when the FBI was handling an average of 700,000 investigative
matters per year.
Nonetheless, the criticism which has been expressed
regarding the Counterintelligence Programs is most legitimate
and understandable.
The question might well be asked what I had in mind when
I stated last year that for the FBI to have done less than it
did under the circumstances then existing would have been an
abdication of its responsibilities to the American people..
17
18
19
20
What I said then, in 1974, and what I believe today, is
that the FBI employees involved in these programs did what they
felt was expected of them by the President, the Attorney General,
the Congress, and the people of the United States.

Bomb explosions rocked public and private offices and
buildings; rioters led by revolutionary extremists laid seige
to military, industrial, and educational facilities; and
killings, maimings, and other atrocities accompanied such
acts of violence from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings, men, women,
2 and children. As is the case in time of peril, whether real or
perceived, they looked to their Government, their elected and
appointed leadership, and to the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies to protect their lives, their property, and their
rights.
7
There were many calls for action from Members of Congress
8

and others, but few guidelines were furnished. The FBI and other
law enforcement agencies were besieged by demands, impatient
demands, for immediate action.

FBI employees recognized the danger; felt they had a
responsibility to respond; and in good faith initiated actions
designed to counter conspiratorial efforts of self-proclaimed
revolutionary groups, and to neutralize violent activities.
In the development and execution of these programs,
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.
Our concern over whatever abuses occurred in the Counter-
intelligence Programs, and there were some substantial ones,
should not obscure the underlying purpose of those programs.
We must recognize that situations have occurred in the
past and will arise in the future where the Government may well
be expected to depart from its traditional role, in the FBI's
case, as an investigative and intelligence-gathering
agency, and take affirmative steps which are needed to meet
an imminent threat to human life or property.

In short, if we learn a murder or bombing is to be carried
out now, can we truly meet our responsibilities by investigating
only after the crime has occurred, or should we have the
ability to prevent? I refer to those instances where there is
a strong sense of urgency because of an imminent threat to
human life.
Where there exists the potential to penetrate and disrupt,
the Congress must consider the question of whether or not such
preventive action should be available to the FBI.
These matters are currently being addressed by a task
11
force in the Justice Department, including the FBI,
12
and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and controls can
13

to insure that such measures are used in an entirely responsible

manner.
Probably the most important question here today is what
assurances I can give that the errors and abuses which arose
under the Counterintelligence Programs will not occur again?
First, let me assure the Committee that some very sub-
stantial changes have been made in key areas of the FBI's
methods of operations since I took the oath of office as
Director on July 9, 1973.
Today we place a high premium on openness, openness
both within and without the service.
I have instituted a program of open, frank discussion

in the decision-making process which insures that no future

and suggestions, and to voice whatever criticisms or

The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine, and I take
full responsibility for them. My goal is to achieve maximum
critical analysis among our personnel without in any manner
weakening or undermining our basic command structure.
The results of this program have been most beneficial, to
me personally, to the FBI's disciplined performance, and to
the morale of our employees.
In addition, since some of the mistakes of the past
were occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities outside
the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward Levi's
guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability, in his
own words, \"as a 'lightning rod' to deflect improper requests.\"
Within days after taking office, Attorney General Levi
instructed that I immediately report to him any requests
or practices which, in my judgment, were improper or which,
considering the context of the request, I believed presented

Attorney General that during my nearly two and one half years as
Director under two Presidents and three Attorneys General, no

practices. These are discussed openly and candidly in order
that the Attorney General can exercise his responsibilities
over the FBI.

I am convinced that the basic structure of the FBI today
is sound. But it would be a mistake to think that integrity
can be assured only through institutional means..

character of the person who occupies the office of the
Director and every member of the FBI under him.

The Congress and the members of this Committee in

As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment have been
made. But no one who is looking for the cause of our
failures should confine his search solely to the FBI, or even
to the Executive Branch.
The Congress itself has long possessed the mechanism for
FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been exercised.
An initial step was taken in the Senate in 1973 when the
Committee on the Judiciary established a Subcommittee on FBI
Oversight. Hearings had been commenced, and we were fully
committed to maximum participation with the members of that
Subcommittee.

those benefits are wasted if they do not lead to the next step,
a step that I believe is absolutely essential , a legislative
charter, expressing Congressional determination of intelligence
jurisdiction for the FBI.
Action to resolve the problems confronting us in the
security and intelligence fields is urgently needed; and it
7
must be undertaken in a forthright manner.
Neither the Congress
8
nor the public can afford to look the other way, leaving it to
9

the FBI to do what must be done, as too often has occurred in
the past.
11
12
13
This means too that Congress must assume a continuing role
not in the initial decision-making process but in the review of
our performance.
14
15
16
17
I would caution against a too-ready reliance upon the
courts to do our tough thinking for us. Some proposals that
have been advanced during these hearings would extend the role
of the courts into the early stages of the investigative
18
19
process and, thereby, would take over what historically have
been Executive Branch decisions.
20
21
I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked, would
seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary and cast
23
22 them in a role not contemplated by the authors of our
Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a substitute for Con-
24
gressional oversight or Executive decision.

Senators, first and foremost, I am a police officer, a
career police officer. In my police experience, the must
frustrating of all problems that I have discovered facing
law enforcement in this country, Federal, state, and local, is
when demands are made of them to perform their traditional
role as protector of life and property without clear and
understandable legal bases to do so.
:
11
12
I recognize that the formulation of such a legislative
charter will be a most precise and demanding task.
13
It must be sufficiently flexible that it does not stifle
14
15
16
the FBI's effectiveness in combating the growing incidence
of crime and violence across the United States. That charter
must clearly address the demonstrated problems of the past;
17

so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive
`challenges.

The fact that the Department of Justice has commenced

for legislation. The responsibility for conferring juris-
diction resides with the Congress.
In this regard, I am troubled by some proposals which

As a practical matter, the line between intelligence
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult
to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation may
well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But there
are some fundamental differences between these investigations
that should be recognized, differences in scope, in objective
and in the time of initiation. In the usual criminal case, a
crime has occurred and it remains only for the Government to
identify the perpetrator and to collect sufficient evidence
for prosecution.
Since the investigation normally follows
the elements of the crime, the scope of the inquiry is
limited and fairly well defined.
By contrast, intelligence work involves the gathering of
information, not necessarily evidence. The purpose may well be

not to prosecute, but to thwart crime or to insure that the
Government has enough information to meet any future crisis
or emergency. The inquiry is necessarily broad because it
must tell us not only the nature of the threat, but also whether
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the

means by which the threat will be carried out. The ability
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent on
our anticipation of those criminal acts. Anticipation,

Certainly, reasonable people can differ on these issues.
Given the opportunity, I am confident that the continuing need

of the Congress. We recognize that what is at stake here is not
the interests of the FBI, but rather the interests of every
citizen of this country. We recognize also that the resolution
of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful
deliberation by the Congress. To this end, I pledge the

Director Sec'y

On 12/4/75, a meeting was held with the following
representatives of captioned Committee: Chief Counsel F.A.O.
Schwartz; Assistant Counsel Paul Michel; Staff Member Mark
Gitenstein; Staff Director of the Domestic Task Force John T.
Elliff; and Staff Member John Bayley. Representing the Bureau
at this meeting were Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams,
Assistant Director John A. Mintz, Inspector John B. Hotis, and
SA Paul V. Daly.

The meeting discussed the forthcoming testimony on
12/9/75 of the Director before that Committee and Elliff fur-1
nished the Bureau two draft papers discussing the Bureau's
investigative jurisdiction and issues the Committee Staff feels
the Senate Select Committee must address from a legislative
standpoint. Copies of these papers are attached.

The first paper which consists of six pages discusses
in Part 1 what the Committee sees as problems arising out of
the FBI's domestic intelligence investigations. This portion
highlights the fact that these investigations may be overbroad
in scope, collect irrelevant information, and continue the in-
vestigations beyond what the Committee sees as their normal
investigative conclusion. This portion also addresses the
investigative techniques used during these investigations and
the resultant dissemination of information collected.

Under Part 2, the document discusses options available
to the Committee. These options run the gamut from abolition
of the Bureau's domestic intelligence functions to administrative
oversight by the Attorney General or Congressional oversight or
enacting legislation providing for domestic intelligence investi-
gations with legislative limits imposed on such investigations.
Included is the consideration of creating an independent
Inspector General.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

The second position paper which was prepared by
John T. Elliff begins by a six-page statement and analysis
of the Bureau's current authority to conduct domestic in-
telligence investigations. He then lists four options for
the Committee.

Option 1 is for Congress to pass legislation ratifying
the existing FBI authority as set forth by Presidential directives
and Executive Orders.

Option 2 suggests. Congress might give serious con-
sideration to creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency
within the Department of Justice. In this Option, Elliff sug-
gests that the FBI itself has considered this Option as part of
the larger question of separating all FBI intelligence functions
from law enforcement functions of the Bureau.

Option 3. considers the elimination of FBI domestic
intelligence. In his analysis of this position, it might be
possible for the Bureau to develop the necessary intelligence
information through its normal criminal investigations and
thus remove the necessity for domestic intelligence investi-
gations as presently conducted.

Option 4 considers setting standards for domestic
intelligence investigations. In this. Option, Elliff states
that the FBI should be authorized by statute to conduct domestic
intelligence investigations only as Congress finds that regular
criminal investigations would not provide information to an-
ticipate or prevent the use of violence in violations of Federal
law and that incidents of the use of violence in such violations
are of a serious nature and threaten the security of the country.

For purposes of the Director's appearance on 12/9/75
before the Senate Select Committee, it is believed his response
to questions concerning the aforementioned position papers should
be that the Bureau has received copies and is reviewing the various
proposals and that it would not be appropriate at this time for
the Director to comment regarding the substance of the proposals.

RE: SENSTUDY 75

Elliff indicated during this meeting that the Director
during his appearance may anticipate being asked a question by
one of the Senators relating to his statement before the American
Bar Association in Montreal concerning the necessity for the
sacrifice of certain individual rights at the expense of investi-
gations. He also anticipated the Director might be asked a
question concerning his position on COINTELPRO. Regarding
the question concerning the Director's statement before the
American Bar Association in Montreal, the Legal Counsel Divi-
sion will draft a proposed resonse. Concerning COINTELPRO, a
response has been prepared and will be put together with the
briefing material for the Director.

This memorandum in general highlights the Options
presented in the attached papers. A more detailed analysis
should be prepared by the Intelligence Division and existing
documents addressing these proposals should be made available
for the Director's briefing book for his testimony.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Director respond to questions concerning
the attached position papers as set forth above.

Done.

(2) That the Legal Counsel Division draft a proposed
response concerning the Director's statement made in Montreal
relating to the sacrifice of certain individual rights.

Done.

(3) That the Intelligence Division make a detailed
review of the various Options set forth in the two attached
position papers. (FOR SUBSEQUENT STAFF CONFEE CA

Issues and Options for Discussion with
Former Attorneys General Rogers, Katzenbach, and Clark

I. Background

MDR-16
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 10/31/00 BY SPALMKP

In the past few weeks the staff has presented the Committee
with evidence suggesting the following about the FBI's
internal security intelligence program:

A. The program is massive, involving the collection of
information on the activities of thousands of innocent,
law-abiding American citizens.

B. These individuals were not alleged espionage agents, but
citizens who fall within the FBI's vague definitions of
\"subversion\" and \"extremism\" purely homegrown \"threats
to the national security\".

C. That FBI policy on \"subversive\" and \"extremist\" inves-
tigations was vague and subject to the following abuses:

1. overbreadth in scope in that groups were investigated
whose threats to the national security were tenuous,
if not non-existent.

2. collection of information on the personal life and
political views of subjects unrelated to the national
security.

3. the continuance of investigations well after it
should have become obvious that there was no legiti-
mate predicate.

D. Particularly invasive collection techniques were used,
including electronic surveillance, mail opening, and sur-
reptitious entries. Although these have been terminated,
the predominant and perhaps most insidious continues
today through the FBI's huge informant/confidential source
network.

E. Information collected in the course of these investiga-
tions is disseminated regularly throughout the federal
government and to local law enforcement.

F. Until 1971, information collected through these investi-
gations was disseminated as part of the COINTELPRO pro-
gram to the subjects' friends, relatives, employers, and
others in an effort to discredit or \"neutralize\" alleged
extre 2-1116 393 12154
\"subversives\" or \"extremists\".
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 5
ENCLOSURE

2

G. The FBI's internal security intelligence program was
used by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard
Nixon to serve their political interests, usually by
collecting information on critics or political
opponents.

H. The program was conceived and implemented in secrecy,
and although parts of the program were shared with out-
side authorities from time to time, until now no
President, Attorney General, or Congressional committee
has been exposed to the entire program in detail.

I. The program is not authorized by statute but is founded
on a series of secret or ambiguous Presidential orders,
which in turn are based upon a questionable assertion
of \"inherent constitutional authority\".

J. The program continues today, albeit on a much more
limited basis than in the late 1960's and early 1970's,
and the basic machinery for the program -- the huge
informant/confidential source network is still
operating...

K. There is no statute or internal Bureau or Justice Depart-
'ment policy prohibiting a new Director, Attorney General,
or President from ordering the Bureau to expand the pro-
gram to its earlier dimensions.

II. Issues and Options

Among the issues and options which might be discussed with
former Attorneys General in response to what the Committee
has learned are the following:

A. Abolition. Elimination of the FBI internal security
intelligence program as Attorney General Harlan Stone
ordered in 1924 when confronted with abuses growing out
of the FBI's first internal security intelligence pro-
gram, such as the infamous Palmer raids.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether there are not some functions (e.g., protecting
the President, preventing or at least predicting
violence by terrorist organizations, or predicting
civil disorders) which require intelligence collec-
tion.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 6

3

2. Whether FBI intelligence reports are valuable in
that respect, especially in light of a recent GAO
report suggesting that such reports are rarely use-
ful in predicting violent activity.

3. Whether such information, assuming it is valuable,
could not be obtained through more traditional criminal
investigations.

4. Whether the value of the information, marginal or
otherwise, justifies the risk to civil liberties
inherent in such intelligence collection.

5. Whether, given the way in which limited and ambiguous
grants of authority have been expanded into major
authorizations,any statute short of a total prohibi-
tion of all non-law enforcement intelligence activi
ties in the domestic sector will be adequate to pre-
vent the recurrences of the kinds of abuses uncovered
by this Committee. (Or, conversely, whether it is
possible to draft a law authorizing a limited civil
disturbance and counter-terrorist intelligence mission
that will not eventually evolve, like the National
Security Act of 1947, into a charter for unanticipated
and unwanted covert activities.)

6. Whether it would be sufficient to restrict the FBI
to criminal investigations without also (a) placing
limits upon the length of investigations, (b) the
kinäs of information which can be collected and dis-
seminated on the subject irrelevant to the alleged
criminal act, (c). the utilization of warrantless
electronic surveillance and other particularly inva-
sive collection techniques, and (d) the utilization
of a huge informant/confidential source network with-
out judicial or Justice Department supervision.

B. Authorizing Statute. Recognition of the value of
internal security intelligence, but placing limits upon
the program designed to minimize the infringement upon
civil liberties, an option being actively considered by
the present Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out under the first option and,
in addition:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 7

4

1. Whether meaningful and stringent guidelines can be
written which do not so hamper the administration
of an internal security intelligence program as to
make the product not just marginal, as GAO suggests,
but worthless.*

2. In light of the possibility that the present Attorney
General may address this matter via internal Justice
Department guidelines, whether this approach does
not ignore the legal authority question which can
only be resolved by statute.

3. Whether or not Congress could draft a statutory ver-
sion of the guidelines which could be flexible enough
to meet an evolving threat and at the same time
place meaningful restrictions upon the program.

4. Even assuming there is no absence of legal authority,
is it safe to leave these guidelines in the form of a
departmental order which can be rescinded by the next
Attorney General?

C. Delegation of Authority to Attorney General. Simply
ratifying the present program via enactment of a statutory
charter which grants the FBI authority to conduct an
internal security intelligence program subject to its own
internal guidelines or departmental guidelines as proposed
by the Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and:

1. Whether such a statute would not be an unconstitu-
tional delegation of powers to the Executive Branch.

2. Whether enactment of such a statute 'would not repre-
sent a failure by the Congress to confront the issues
raised above.

*A preliminary staff analysis of the Attorney General's draft
guidelines suggests that, despite months of conscientious and
painstaking work by a departmental task force, the guidelines
are not adequate. This analysis, which will be presented when
Attorney General Levi testifies on December 10, indicates that
several of the more questionable FBI investigations (e.g., of
Dr. King and the women's liberation movement) would still be
permissible under these proposed guidelines.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 8

5

D. Legislative Inaction. Enact no new statute affecting
the FBI's legal authority or the internal security intel-
ligence program.
:
In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and, in addition:

1. Whether this failure to act might not leave the
status of the program in doubt and subject to court
challenge.

2. :
Whether this failure to act after full disclosure
by the Bureau might not be taken by the FBI and the
courts as a ratification of the program.

E. Administrative Oversight by the Attorney General. The
Justice Department should be required to exercise greater
administrative oversight over the FBI's internal security
intelligence program by Attorney General Levi, regardless
of whatever other options Congress accepts.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is practical for the Attorney General or
his staff to review thousands of such investigations
each year.

2. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should
review all or just the so-called \"full\" investiga-
tions.

3. Whether, to facilitate the conduct of such reviews,
the Attorney General or his staff should be given
\"complete\" access to Bureau files, including informa-
tion regarding the identity and reliability of infor-
mants and confidential sources.

4. Whether it is possible to develop a staff of career
attorneys within the Department with both the access.
and independence essential to the conduct of search-
ing reviews.

5. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should not
also be required to review various informant and so-
called \"intensification\" programs, and the establish-
ment of specialized indices (which have a significant
impact upon which cases are opened) instead of just
reviewing individual investigations in a vacuum as
provided by the Attorney General's draft guidelines.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 9

6

F. An. Inspector General. In addition to the above options,
an independent Inspector General should be created to
investigate improprieties by the FBI. This option is
advanced by those concerned about the inadequacy of the
FBI's investigation of the disappearance of former
Director Hoover's personal files, its limited inquiry
into the so-called Atlantic City convention case, and
the absence of any internal investigation of the abuses
in the King case.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to maintain the independence
of an Inspector General within the Department of
Justice when both the Inspector General and the
Director of the FBI will be responsible to the same
official, the Attorney General.

2. Whether the Inspector General should have \"complete\"
access to Bureau files, including information per-
taining to the identity and reliability of informants
and confidential sources.

3. Whether an Inspector General with access to extremely
sensitive information might not become a serious
threat to the independence of the Bureau from politi-
cal influence and to the civil liberties of American
citizens.
:
G. Congressional Oversight. In addition to the above
options, the creation of an oversight committee(s) in the
Congress, to which the Bureau would be required to report
and which would have the power to investigate abuses.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the kinds of problems posed by the Justice Department
oversight and Inspector General options discussed above
to the independence of the FBI and the confidentiality
of its files.

H. Public Reporting and Disclosure to Subjects. In addition
to the above options, the requirement that the FBI make
frequent public reports on the details of its internal
security intelligence programs and policies and reveal
the details of improper intelligence investigations to
the subjects of those investigations.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 10

7

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to reveal the essence of some
programs and policies and the details of some inves-
tigations without jeopardizing the effectiveness of
legitimate programs.

2. Whether such disclosure might not increase the num-
ber of law suits filed against the FBI alleging
illegal activities.

DRAFT
MEMORANDUM

December 4, 1975.
FBI LEGISLATION - PROPOSED OPTIONS

In preparation for the testimony of FBI Director
Kelley and Attorney General Levi on December 9 and 10, the
Domestic Intelligence Task Force is pulling together various
proposals for legislation dealing with FBI intelligence.
This paper sets forth some of the basic options.

A: Current Statutes and Executive Orders

The basic statute governing the FBI is 18 U.S.C. 533,
which reads as follows:

The Attorney General may appoint officials:
(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against
the United States, (2) to assist in the
protection of the person of the President,
and (3) to conduct such other investigations
regarding official matters under the control
of the Department of Justice and the Depart-
ment of State as may be directed by the
Attorney General.

Clauses (2) and (3) are a possible statutory basis
for intelligence investigations going beyond the investigation
of specific federal crimes. Under (2), the FBI may \"assist\" the
Secret Service in the protection of the President by providing

intelligence on persons or groups who may endanger the Presi-
dent's safety. A formal agreement between the FBI and the
Secret Service sets forth the types of intelligence information
provided by the Bureau. However, this agreement states that:

The FBI will not conduct investigation
of individuals or groups solely for the pur-
pose of establishing whether they constitute
a threat to the safety of the President and
certain other persons unless there is an
indication of a violation of Title 18, U. S.
Code, Section 1751, or other statute over
which the FBI has jurisdiction. (Tab A)

Clause (3) recognizes that the Attorney General may
direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of Justice.\" This is a
possible statutory basis for at least two broad areas of FBI
intelligence investigations civil disturbance intelligence
and intelligence for the Federal Employee Security. Program.

The most recent legal advice to the FBI from the Justice
Department on the gathering and reporting of data regarding
civil disturbances notes that on April 1, 1969, the President
designated the Attorney General as chief civilian officer to
coordinate the government's response to civil disturbances.
The FBI is instructed to gather and report on \"all significant
incidents of civil unrest\" and on \"all disturbances where there
are indications that extremist organizations are believed
to be involved in efforts to instigate or exploit them.\" The
:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 13

3

FBI is spécifically advised to make reports \"even when no
specific violation of federal law is indicated.\" On the other
hand, the FBI is instructed not to report \"every relatively in-
significant incident of a strictly local nature coming to its
attention.\" (Tab B)

The Justice Department has given the following recent
instructions to the FBI regarding intelligence for the Federal
Employee Security Program. Executive Order 10450, as amended
by Executive Order 11785, is interpreted as requiring an FBI
:
investigation of organizations \"with a potential\" of violating
federal or state statutes prohibiting unlawful advocacy of vio-
lence or the commission of any unlawful act of violence. The
FBI is advised that \"it is not possible to set definite para-
meters covering the initiation of investigations of potential
organizations falling within the Order.\" The FBI is instructed
to apply \"the same yardstick\" to investigations of individuals
who are affiliated with such organizations. The FBI is specifi-
cally advised that \"it is not necessary that a crime occur
before the investigation is initiated.\" (Tab C)

Clause (3) also recognizes that the Attorney General
may direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of State.\" This is a pos-
sible statutory basis for FBI intelligence investigation of
foreign intelligence activities within the United States or to
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 14

4

collect positive foreign intelligence. The best example is
the Attorney General's authorization of warrantless FBI elec-
tronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. However,
there is apparently no instruction from the Justice Department
to the FBI directing the Bureau to initiate investigations of
individuals or organizations which have a marked potential for
use by a foreign intelligence service, but about which there is.
no information indicating intelligence 'activity. (See Staff
Report, \"Counterintelligence/Counterespionage: The Law and
the Philosophy\", October 14, 1975.)
:
In his testimony before the Committee, Deputy Associate
FBI Director James Adams made no reference to clauses (2) and
(3) as a possible legal basis for FBI intelligence investiga-
tions going beyond the investigation of specific federal crimes.
Instead, he placed sole reliance on a series of Presidential
directives extending from 1936 until the 1960's which the FBI
interprets as authorizing it to engage in \"domestic security
intelligence investigations\". The Attorney General has codified
these directives in a Justice Department regulation instructing
the FBI to:

Carry out the Presidential directive
of September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presi-
dential directives of January 8, 1943, July
24, 1950, and December 15, 1953, designating
the [FBI) to take charge of investigative
work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,
subversive activities, and related matters.
28 C.F.R., Section 0.85(d).
NW.88614 Docld:32989602 Page 15

5

The FBI also cites directives of President Kennedy on June 9,
1962, and Attorney General Kennedy on March 5, 1964, which
are the latest charter for the Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference, composed of the FBI Director and the chiefs of the
military intelligence agencies. This group is authorized to
coordinate \"all investigation of domestic espionage, counter-
espionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related intelligence
matters affecting internal security.\" (Tab D)

The theory behind the FBI's position is that the Presi-
dent has inherent constitutional powers, at least in the
absence of contrary legislation, to authorize FBI intelligence
activities. The only judicial support for this theory is
language in the Supreme Court's opinion in the Keith case,
which declared warrantless wiretapping of domestic groups un-
constitutional.

The Court acknowledged the importance of \"national secu-
rity in its domestic implications especially at a time
of worldwide ferment and when civil disorders in this country
are more prevalent than in the less turbulent periods of our
history.\" Under such circumstances, the Court stated, the
President has a \"fundamental duty\" under the Constitution to
\"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States.\" The Court added, \"Implicit in that duty is the power
to protect our Government against those who would subvert or
overthrow it by unlawful means.\" Hence, the Court appeared to
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 16

-6

recognize that the President's \"domestic security role\" has a
\"constitutional basis\"; that the President through the Attorney
General may need \"to obtain intelligence information about those
who plot unlawful acts against the Government\"; and that \"threats
and acts of sabotage against the Government exist in sufficient
number to justify investigative powers with respect to them.\"
The Court applied the general principle, that \"unless the Govern-
ment safeguards its own capacity to function and to preserve
the security of its people, society itself could become so dis-.
ordered that all rights and liberties would be endangered.\"

Nevertheless, the central holding of the Keith decision was that
this power may not be exercised in such a way as to infringe
constitutional rights. 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

Even though the President may have the authority under
the Constitution to direct the FBI to conduct intelligence
investigations in the absence of legislation, Congress has the
ultimate authority to substitute statutory authorization in
place of the Presidential directives. As Justice Robert Jackson
declared in the Steel Seizure Case, \"When the President takes
measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.
*
343 U.S. 579,
637.

B. Option One Ratifying Existing Powers

The first option for Congress is legislation ratifying
the existing. authority granted to the FBI by current Presiden-
tial directives and orders. Such legislation would be cast in
extremely general terms. Its main advantage is that it would
provide a basis for Congressional oversight. It could also
reinforce the Attorney General's role as the immediate super-.
visor of FBI intelligence activities. The statute would
authorize the Attorney General to direct the FBI:

1. to conduct investigations of domestic espionage,
counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive activities;

2. to gather and report information on civil distur-
bances;

3. to conduct investigations of other related intelli-
gence matters affecting internal security; and :

4. to conduct investigations of official matters relat-
ing to the Department of State.

In addition, the statute would require the Attorney General
to report annually to the appropriate Congressional committees
on the volume and type of investigations and reports, the
investigative techniques used, and the policies and procedures
adopted by the Justice Department and the FBI.

The weaknesses of this approach are obvious. Congress.
would have legislated a wholesale delegation of power without
:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 18

8

standards or limitations other than the supervision of the
Attorney General and oversight by Congress. In view of the
Select Committee's findings as to the vast overbreadth of FBI
domestic intelligence investigations and the abuses committed
in the name of \"counterintelligence\", Congress would in effect
be permitting future expansion of FBI operations to match past
policies.

c. Option Two A Separate Security Intelligence Agency

Congress might give serious consideration to legislation
creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency within the
Justice Department. It would perform the functions of the
present Counterintelligence Branch of the FBI Intelligence
Division; dealing with foreign intelligence and counterintelli-
*gence/counterespionage. The FBI itself has considered this
option as part of the larger question of separating all FBI
intelligence functions from the law enforcement functions of
the Bureau. (Tab E)

A separate agency would be justified only if it was
authorized to conduct investigations of a wider scope and using
different techniques than would otherwise be permitted. In
other words, Congress could decide that foreign counterintelli-
gence investigations should go beyond investigation of specific
crimes, that techniques such as electronic surveillance should
be used without a warrant or with a special type of warrant,
:
竹
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 19

9

and that operations should be conducted to \"counter\" foreign
intelligence activities by means other than arrest or \"persona
non grata\" proceedings. On the other hand, if Congress treats
the investigation of foreign intelligence activities the same
as a criminal investigation, then the FBI should keep the job.

Any statute in this area must use general language for
diplomatic reasons. For example, Congress should not explicitly
authorize deception operations or efforts to compromise hostile
intelligence officers, even though such techniques may be
envisioned. Such techniques are dealt with best by establish-
ing adequate procedures for authorization and oversight to
ensure accountability.
:
The legislation should be more specific where it deals
with investigations and other operations directed at American
citizens rather than non-resident aliens in the service of a
foreign power.. If Congress believes Americans should be inves-
tigated if they have a marked potential for use by a foreign
intelligence service, but no information indicating intelligence
activity yet exists, the legislation should say so.

The statute should also set out standards for determin-
ing whether a foreign-dominated domestic organization falls
within the jurisdiction of the separate agency. There should
at the very least be substantial information indicating that
the organization is directed by, subsidized by, or in active
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 20.

collaboration with a foreign government or organization. (The
term \"foreign organization\" refers, for instance, to a group
like the Palestine Liberation Organization.) If the group fits
the criteria for foreign domination, there should be an addi-
tional finding that it may engage in intelligence activities or
in activities involving the use of violence in violations of
federal law.

If the group meets all these standards, Congress may
authorize the investigation of its activities going beyond
regular criminal investigations. Such investigations could
extend to all individuals who are members of, or express sup-
port for, the organization, as well as to the efforts of the
organization to influence and control other groups. However,
it may be sufficient to authorize only the investigation. of
active members and supporters. This would prevent a revival
of the \"Cominfil\" policy of looking into all forms of lawful
political and social activity where Communists might be involv-
ed.

The Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO considered
the need for special supervision of foreign counterintelligence
operations in the United States. It recommended the creation
of a Foreign Intelligence Advisory Commission to make decisions
with regard to the necessity or acceptability of particular
foreign counterintelligence techniques. (Tab F) This proposal
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 21.

11
:
has merit in view of the limited amount of time the Attorney
General can give to personal supervision and the after-the-fact
role of legislative oversight regarding the separate agency.

Finally, legislation to create a separate foreign
counterintelligence agency must deal with relationships to the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, and other
foreign intelligence agencies. The current FBI-CIA agreement
on their respective jurisdictions is only a \"memorandum of under-
standing\". It allows the CIA to undertake certain clandestine
activities within the United States, in coordination with the
FBI. (Tab G) Proposals are currently circulating in the Execu-
tive Branch for a new National Security Council Intelligence
Directive to clarify this matter, as well as to regulate CIA
electronic surveillance of American citizens abroad. (Tab H)

A full draft of a statutory charter for a separate
foreign counterintelligence agency is not included here, since
the focus is on domestic intelligence issues.. However, one
implication of such a statute would be that the remaining FBI
functions should relate only to law enforcement and criminal
investigations.

D. Option Three Elimination of FBI Domestic Intelligence

The basic assumption behind Attorney General Levi's
effort to develop \"guidelines\" for FBI domestic intelligence
is that regular criminal investigations are not adequate to
:
NW 88614 DocId:32989602 Page 22
:

12

..
supply the information needed to anticipate or prevent the use
of violence in violations of federal. law. That assumption
should be questioned. Regular criminal investigations are
likely to produce a substantial amount of information which
can be used to anticipate or prevent future crimes. For example,
intensive criminal investigations of Ku Klux Klan violence in
the South during the 1960's would have required the FBI to look
into a wide variety of Klan activities. Another example is the
search for Weatherman fugitives, a regular criminal investiga-
tion which involves broad inquiries across the country. The
FBI has not yet demonstrated that the preventive information
it has obtained came from intelligence investigations which
would not have been conducted as regular criminal investigations.
.:
The fact that an FBI investigation was supervised by
its Intelligence Division does not necessarily mean that the
investigation was, automatically, outside the regular criminal
law enforcement jurisdiction of the Bureau. Any FBI investiga-
tion of activities involving the use of violence in violations
of federal law falls within that jurisdiction. Moreover,
regular criminal investigations can also extend to plans,
attempts, or conspiracies to engage in such activities.

One suggested difference between intelligence-type and
regular criminal investigations is that the latter are
terminated after a reasonable time, if sufficient evidence to

1
Senator Mondale. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
2
I have always supported the FBI. It is clearly the finest,
3
most professional law enforcement agency in the nation and
4
probably in the world. In apprehending robbers, foiling
5
kidnappers, catching fugitives, the FBI has an outstanding
6
record.
7
This is based on my own experience with the FBI in my
8
own state where I served as Attorney General. The vast bulk
9
of its work is devoted to law enforcement and legitimate
10
counter-espionage.
11
In these fields the FBI deserves fully the admiration
12
and respect which Americans traditionally held for the Bureau
13
and its personnel. But in one area, domestic intelligence,
14
the FBI, in my opinion, has clearly gone astray. It now
15
16
17
18
appears that there was an underworld within the FBI which
took the tools, techniques and zeal which was so effective
against the real foreign threats and turned them in upon some
of the American people.

Yesterday this Committee heard some of the most disturbing
testimony that can be imagined in a free society. We heard
evidence that for decades the institutions designed to enforce
the laws and constitutions of our country itself has been
engaging in conduct that violates the law and the Constitution.
24
We heard that the FBI, which is a part of the Department of
25
Justice, took justice into its own hands by seeking to punish
NW 88614 Docld:32989543 Page 5

those with unpopular ideas. We learned that the chief law
2
enforcement agency in the Federal government decided that it
3
did not need laws to investigate and suppress the peaceful
4
and constitutional activities of those whom it disapproved.
5
We heard testimony that the FBI, to protect the country
6
against those it believed had totalitarian political views,
7
employed the tactics of totalitarian societies against
8
American citizens. We heard that the FBI attempted to destroy
9
one of our greatest leaders in the field of civil rights, and
10
then replace him with someone of the FBI's choosing.
11
From the evidence the Committee has obtained it is
12
clear that the FBI for decades has conducted surveillance over
13
the personal and political activities of millions of
14
Americans. Evidently, no meeting was too small, no group
15
too insignificant to escape their attention. It did not
1
16
seem to matter whether the politics of these Americans were
17
legal or radical or whether the participants were well known
18
or obscure. It did not matter whether the information was
19
intimate and personal.
The FBI created indexes, more
20
commonly called enemy lists, of thousands of Americans and
21
targeted many of the Americans on these lists for special
22
harassment. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were victims
23
of this surveillance program. Most of this was done in secret.
24
Much of it was kept from Congress and the Justice Department
25
and all of it from the American people. No one outside the

1
FBI has ever had an opportunity to know and appreciate the
2 full extent of the domestic surveillance program that was
3
then being conducted. T...
4
Thus we see that just as in the case of the CIA the
5
key issue was accountability: How we can assure that the
\".
6
secret instruments of government are accountable to the
7
people, the Congress and the law.
8
It is clear that the FBI's authority for these programs
9
is essentially non-existent.
I am not persuaded that the
10
secret Presidential orders of. President Roosevelt support the
11
Domestic Intelligence program, and even if it did, I do
:
12
not believe that any President has the authority to order the
13
FBI or anyone else to spy on Americans, to burgle their homes,
14
to wiretap them, to open their mail or to blackmail them.
15
One of the most disturbing aspects of this affair is
16
that the FBI never paid very much attention to whether their
17
18
activities were authorized or not or whether they were legal
and constitutional.
One former senior intelligence officer
19
has testified that he never once heard a discussion about
20
legality or constitutionality. Most governments in history
:
21
22
have relied on some form of police power to determine what
views would prevail in their society. However, America was
23
24
25
based on the revolutionary concept that the people should
decide what is right and what is wrong, what is acceptable
and what is not.

That is what we meant by a free government, and our
2 forefathers were convinced that it can exist only through the
3
4
5
greatest tolerance of speech and opinion. They placed their
faith in the people to remain alert to encroachments on their
liberty..
6
The founders of our country knew that the greatest
7
danger to freedom comes from the efforts of government to
8
suppress the opinions of its opponents. They set up a
9
system which limited the powers of government, bound it in
10
the constraints of the law, and prohibited it from infringing.
11
on the rights of people to free expression. And through
12
13
the. separation of power, the system of checks and balances,
they tried to assure that the Executive would be accountable
14
to the people through the Congress.
15
For the 200 years of our existence as a nation the
16
preservation of liberty has been a constant struggle. Whether
17
it has been the Alien and Sedition Acts during the French
18
Revolution, the Red Scare and the Palmer Raids of World War
19
I, or McCarthyism after World War II, or Army spying during
20
the Vietnam War, the government has let a fear of unorthodox
21
opinion lead it into the trap of infringing upon the
22
Constitution in the name of internal security.
23
The issues we confront today are a part of a continuing
24
drama of American democracy. It is proof, if we ever needed
25
it, that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.

Revelations of abuse of power do not threaten doméstic
2
security. These hearings do not weaken the FBI. What weakens
3
it is its failure to adhere to the proper role of law
4
enforcement.
Somehow it forgot that this was its job. It
5
began to use its energy to spy on Americans whose only
6
offense was an expressing opinions that some in the FBI did not
7
like. It confused talk of violence with acts of violence,
8
and all too often paid more attention to the talk than to
9
'the \"act.
10
The answer, of course, is that violence justifies
1.1
prosecution, not surveillance. Our security is not improved
12
by watching those who commit crimes. Security from violence
13
lies in active and vigorous law enforcement of those who
14
15
16
17
are committing crimes. Security fram dangerous ideas, if
we need any security, should come not from the FBI but
from the merit of better ideas, in the good sense of the
American people.
18
Our liberty is best protected by scrupulous adherence
19
to the law and the Constitution by the agencies of government.
20
No government agency likes to be the subject of public

21
scrutiny. I know these have been difficult times for the
22
present leadership of the FBI, many of whom were not involved
:
23
in these programs at all. But if they had been spending a lot
24
of time responding to Congressional investigations, they
25
could not forget that this is the first time in 50 years that

5
past patterns of stirring up public fears to distract our
6
attention from the necessity of reform.
7
Mr. Chairman, may I say that yesterday I am told that
8
following our hearing the FBI responded exactly in the spirit
:
9
that I had hoped it would. If they can take this constructive
10
approach, I have no doubt that the FBI will benefit from

in law enforcement, in the detection of crime, and in the
:
gathering of legal evidence for prosecution and conviction,
but an FBI without abuses..
As we proceed with these hearings today, we should also
bear in mind the responsibility for the abuses we have
uncovered does not rest on the FBI alone. We in the
Congress have been derelict. It should not have taken until
this date for us to discharge our responsibility for
investigating FBI and other domestic intelligence.
:
We should also realize that the FBI has been performing
a function which many Americans, and at times the vast
majority of Americans, have wanted to see undertaken. When
popular opinion brands a group unAmerican and subversive
merely because of its political views, all too often the FBI

has reponded to public expectations and from pressure from
2
a higher authority in government.
3
While this does not excuse what happened, we should
4
temper our criticism of the FBI's excesses by understanding that
5
in large part it was only the instrument of our own intolerance.
6
Indeed, I believe that is why our laws and the charter of the
7
FBI must be carefully redrawn to protect the FBI's integrity
8
from political pressures and hysteria.
H.
9
Finally, it would be a mistake to regard the abuses
10
of the FBI as those of evil men. The FBI has always been
11
composed of dedicated and hard-working public servants who
12
seek to do their jobs as best they can. The lesson we learn
13
from this history is that we cannot keep our liberty secure.
14
by relying alone on the good faith of men with great power.
15
As Mr. Justice Brandeis once wrote:
16
\"Experience should teach us to be most on guard to
17
protect liberty when government's purposes are beneficient.
18
The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in the insidious
19
encroachment of men of zeal, well-meaning but without
20
understanding.\"
21
It is my hope that the FBI witnesses we will hear today
22
can enlighten us as to how it can conduct internal security
23
surveillance programs which do not infringe on our
24
constitutional liberties. I hope they can suggest iron-clad
25
assurances that the abuses of the past will not be repeated.

Senator Mondale. That is true. I think one of the
points that we might aver to is the Houston Plan and the
tremendous pressure the FBI was placed under to again resume
techniques that it had abandoned in 1966. There is no
question that they were getting private pressure from higher
authority to do things. In that instance they didn't want
22
it.
23
The Chairman. Well, I was struck with the fact that
24
the Houston Plan, as illegal as it was, was limited to techniques
25
far more restrictive than the far-reaching methods that were

Mr. Adams. Well, we have to approach two parts, in

my estimation, Senator Church. One, the basis for our
investigation of Martin Luther King, which was to determine
communist influence on him, my hands are tied in discussing

that somewhat on the basis that there is certain information
which today, from an ongoing operation is sensitive and
which, of course, we have made known to you and certain
staff members.

16
I would like to say on the basis that from our review
we feel that we initially had a basis for investigating Martin
Luther King.
17
Now as far as the activities which you are asking about,
18
19
the discrediting, I know of no basis for that and I will
not attempt to justify it.
20
;
21
The Chairman. You never made a finding, did you, that
Martin Luther King was a communist?
22
Mr. Adams. No, sir, we did not. We were investigating
23
communist influence and the possible effect on him. We
24
never made such a determination.

The Chairman. Very well. Then there was no justification

Is it true that the FBI on another occasion
intervened in an attempt to prevent Dr. Martin Luther King
from seeing the Pope?
Mr. Adams. I believe that is correct, sir. There were
approximately 25 incidents, I believe, of actions taken in
this regard. I think Mr. Schwarz has those available, that
I would lump basically all of them into the same situation
of I. see no statutory basis or no basis of justification for
the activity.
The Chairman. But what was the motive, there being no
statutory basis or other valid basis? What was the motive
for attempting to prevent Dr. Martin Luther King from visiting
with the Pope?

I think that there were, the motive was certainly known to
Mr. Hoover. It was known to one top official who is no longer
with the Bureau and maybe known to others, all of whom have
25
been interviewed by the Committee. Matters bearing on what

Individuals who were closest to him in this effort are not

So I really am not in a position to discuss this motive

issue.

The Chairman. Nevertheless, you would agree that
whatever the motive, it was a very improper thing to do.
Mr. Adams. I cannot find any justification, no, sir.

Director Sec'y

On 12/4/75, a meeting was held with the following
representatives of captioned Committee: Chief Counsel F.A.O.
Schwartz; Assistant Counsel Paul Michel; Staff Member Mark
Gitenstein; Staff Director of the Domestic Task Force John T.
Elliff; and Staff Member John Bayley. Representing the Bureau
at this meeting were Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams,
Assistant Director John A. Mintz, Inspector John B. Hotis, and
SA Paul V. Daly.

The meeting discussed the forthcoming testimony on
12/9/75 of the Director before that Committee and Elliff fur-1
nished the Bureau two draft papers discussing the Bureau's
investigative jurisdiction and issues the Committee Staff feels
the Senate Select Committee must address from a legislative
standpoint. Copies of these papers are attached.

The first paper which consists of six pages discusses
in Part 1 what the Committee sees as problems arising out of
the FBI's domestic intelligence investigations. This portion
highlights the fact that these investigations may be overbroad
in scope, collect irrelevant information, and continue the in-
vestigations beyond what the Committee sees as their normal
investigative conclusion. This portion also addresses the
investigative techniques used during these investigations and
the resultant dissemination of information collected.

Under Part 2, the document discusses options available
to the Committee. These options run the gamut from abolition
of the Bureau's domestic intelligence functions to administrative
oversight by the Attorney General or Congressional oversight or
enacting legislation providing for domestic intelligence investi-
gations with legislative limits imposed on such investigations.
Included is the consideration of creating an independent
Inspector General.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

The second position paper which was prepared by
John T. Elliff begins by a six-page statement and analysis
of the Bureau's current authority to conduct domestic in-
telligence investigations. He then lists four options for
the Committee.

Option 1 is for Congress to pass legislation ratifying
the existing FBI authority as set forth by Presidential directives
and Executive Orders.

Option 2 suggests. Congress might give serious con-
sideration to creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency
within the Department of Justice. In this Option, Elliff sug-
gests that the FBI itself has considered this Option as part of
the larger question of separating all FBI intelligence functions
from law enforcement functions of the Bureau.

Option 3. considers the elimination of FBI domestic
intelligence. In his analysis of this position, it might be
possible for the Bureau to develop the necessary intelligence
information through its normal criminal investigations and
thus remove the necessity for domestic intelligence investi-
gations as presently conducted.

Option 4 considers setting standards for domestic
intelligence investigations. In this. Option, Elliff states
that the FBI should be authorized by statute to conduct domestic
intelligence investigations only as Congress finds that regular
criminal investigations would not provide information to an-
ticipate or prevent the use of violence in violations of Federal
law and that incidents of the use of violence in such violations
are of a serious nature and threaten the security of the country.

For purposes of the Director's appearance on 12/9/75
before the Senate Select Committee, it is believed his response
to questions concerning the aforementioned position papers should
be that the Bureau has received copies and is reviewing the various
proposals and that it would not be appropriate at this time for
the Director to comment regarding the substance of the proposals.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Elliff indicated during this meeting that the Director
during his appearance may anticipate being asked a question by
one of the Senators relating to his statement before the American
Bar Association in Montreal concerning the necessity for the
sacrifice of certain individual rights at the expense of investi-
gations. He also anticipated the Director might be asked a
question concerning his position on COINTELPRO. Regarding
the question concerning the Director's statement before the
American Bar Association in Montreal, the Legal Counsel Divi-
sion will draft a proposed resonse. Concerning COINTELPRO, a
response has been prepared and will be put together with the
briefing material for the Director.

This memorandum in general highlights the Options
presented in the attached papers. A more detailed analysis
should be prepared by the Intelligence Division and existing
documents addressing these proposals should be made available
for the Director's briefing book for his testimony.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Director respond to questions concerning
the attached position papers as set forth above.

Done.

(2) That the Legal Counsel Division draft a proposed
response concerning the Director's statement made in Montreal
relating to the sacrifice of certain individual rights.

Done.

(3) That the Intelligence Division make a detailed
review of the various Options set forth in the two attached
position papers. (FOR SUBSEQUENT STAFF CONFEE CA

Issues and Options for Discussion with
Former Attorneys General Rogers, Katzenbach, and Clark

Background

MDR-16
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 10/31/00 BY SPALMKP

In the past few weeks the staff has presented the Committee
with evidence suggesting the following about the FBI's
internal security intelligence program:

A. The program is massive, involving the collection of
information on the activities of thousands of innocent,
law-abiding American citizens.

B. These individuals were not alleged espionage agents, but
citizens who fall within the FBI's vague definitions of
\"subversion\" and \"extremism\" purely homegrown \"threats
to the national security\".

C. That FBI policy on \"subversive\" and \"extremist\" inves-
tigations was vague and subject to the following abuses:

1. overbreadth in scope in that groups were investigated
whose threats to the national security were tenuous,
if not non-existent.

2. collection of information on the personal life and
political views of subjects unrelated to the national
security.

3. the continuance of investigations well after it
should have become obvious that there was no legiti-
mate predicate.

D. Particularly invasive collection techniques were used,
including electronic surveillance, mail opening, and sur-
reptitious entries. Although these have been terminated,
the predominant and perhaps most insidious continues
today through the FBI's huge informant/confidential source
network.

E. Information collected in the course of these investiga-
tions is disseminated regularly throughout the federal
government and to local law enforcement.

F. Until 1971, information collected through these investi-
gations was disseminated as part of the COINTELPRO pro-
gram to the subjects' friends, relatives, employers, and
others in an effort to discredit or \"neutralize\" alleged
extre 2-1116 393
\"subversives\" or \"extremists\".
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 5

II.
G. The FBI's internal security intelligence program was
used by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard
Nixon to serve their political interests, usually by
collecting information on critics or political
opponents.

H. The program was conceived and implemented in secrecy,
and although parts of the program were shared with out-
side authorities from time to time, until now no
President, Attorney General, or Congressional committee
has been exposed to the entire program in detail.

I The program is not authorized by statute but is founded
on a series of secret or ambiguous Presidential orders,
which in turn are based upon a questionable assertion
of \"inherent constitutional authority\".

J. The program continues today, albeit on a much more
limited basis than in the late 1960's and early 1970's,
and the basic machinery for the program the huge
informant/confidential source network is still
operating...

Κ. There is no statute or internal Bureau or Justice Depart-
'ment policy prohibiting a new Director, Attorney General,
or President from ordering the Bureau to expand the pro-
gram to its earlier dimensions.

Issues and Options

Among the issues and options which might be discussed with
former Attorneys General in response to what the Committee
has learned are the following:

A. Abolition. Elimination of the FBI internal security
intelligence program as Attorney General Harlan Stone
ordered in 1924 when confronted with abuses growing out
of the FBI's first internal security intelligence pro-
gram, such as the infamous Palmer raids.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether there are not some functions (e.g., protecting
the President, preventing or at least predicting
violence by terrorist organizations, or predicting
civil disorders) which require intelligence collec-
tion.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 6
1

B.
J
3

2. Whether FBI intelligence reports are valuable in
that respect, especially in light of a recent GAO
report suggesting that such reports are rarely use-
ful in predicting violent activity.

3. Whether such information, assuming it is valuable,
could not be obtained through more traditional criminal
investigations.

4. Whether the value of the information, marginal or
otherwise, justifies the risk to civil liberties
inherent in such intelligence collection.

5. Whether, given the way in which limited and ambiguous
grants of authority have been expanded into major
authorizations,any statute short of a total prohibi-
tion of all non-law enforcement intelligence activi
ties in the domestic sector will be adequate to pre-
vent the recurrences of the kinds of abuses uncovered
by this Committee. (Or, conversely, whether it is
possible to draft a law authorizing a limited civil
disturbance and counter-terrorist intelligence mission
that will not eventually evolve, like the National
Security Act of 1947, into a charter for unanticipated
and unwanted covert activities.)

6. Whether it would be sufficient to restrict the FBI
to criminal investigations without also (a) placing
limits upon the length of investigations, (b) the
kinäs of information which can be collected and dis-
seminated on the subject irrelevant to the alleged
criminal act, (c). the utilization of warrantless
electronic surveillance and other particularly inva-
sive collection techniques, and (d) the utilization
of a huge informant/confidential source network with-
out judicial or Justice Department supervision.

Authorizing Statute. Recognition of the value of
internal security intelligence, but placing limits upon
the program designed to minimize the infringement upon
civil liberties, an option being actively considered by
the present Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out under the first option and,
in addition:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 7
1

C.
4

1. Whether meaningful and stringent guidelines can be
written which do not so hamper the administration
of an internal security intelligence program as to
make the product not just marginal, as GAO suggests,
but worthless.*

2. In light of the possibility that the present Attorney
General may address this matter via internal Justice
Department guidelines, whether this approach does
not ignore the legal authority question which can
only be resolved by statute.

3. Whether or not Congress could draft a statutory ver-
sion of the guidelines which could be flexible enough
to meet an evolving threat and at the same time
place meaningful restrictions upon the program.

4. Even assuming there is no absence of legal authority,
is it safe to leave these guidelines in the form of a
departmental order which can be rescinded by the next
Attorney General?

Delegation of Authority to Attorney General. Simply
ratifying the present program via enactment of a statutory
charter which grants the FBI authority to conduct an
internal security intelligence program subject to its own
internal guidelines or departmental guidelines as proposed
by the Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and:

1. Whether such a statute would not be an unconstitu-

2.
tional delegation of powers to the Executive Branch.

Whether enactment of such a statute 'would not repre-
sent a failure by the Congress to confront the issues
raised above.

*A preliminary staff analysis of the Attorney General's draft
guidelines suggests that, despite months of conscientious and
painstaking work by a departmental task force, the guidelines
are not adequate. This analysis, which will be presented when
Attorney General Levi testifies on December 10, indicates that
several of the more questionable FBI investigations (e.g., of
Dr. King and the women's liberation movement) would still be
permissible under these proposed guidelines.

Legislative Inaction. Enact no new statute affecting
the FBI's legal authority or the internal security intel-
ligence program.
:

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and, in addition:

1. Whether this failure to act might not leave the
status of the program in doubt and subject to court
challenge.

2. :
Whether this failure to act after full disclosure
by the Bureau might not be taken by the FBI and the
courts as a ratification of the program.

Administrative Oversight by the Attorney General. The
Justice Department should be required to exercise greater
administrative oversight over the FBI's internal security
intelligence program by Attorney General Levi, regardless
of whatever other options Congress accepts.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is practical for the Attorney General or
his staff to review thousands of such investigations
each year.

2. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should
review all or just the so-called \"full\" investiga-
tions.

3. Whether, to facilitate the conduct of such reviews,
the Attorney General or his staff should be given
\"complete\" access to Bureau files, including informa-
tion regarding the identity and reliability of infor-
mants and confidential sources.

4. Whether it is possible to develop a staff of career
attorneys within the Department with both the access.
and independence essential to the conduct of search-
ing reviews.

5. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should not
also be required to review various informant and so-
called \"intensification\" programs, and the establish-
ment of specialized indices (which have a significant
impact upon which cases are opened) instead of just
reviewing individual investigations in a vacuum as
provided by the Attorney General's draft guidelines.

-
An. Inspector General. In addition to the above options,
an independent Inspector General should be created to
investigate improprieties by the FBI. This option is
advanced by those concerned about the inadequacy of the
FBI's investigation of the disappearance of former
Director Hoover's personal files, its limited inquiry
into the so-called Atlantic City convention case, and
the absence of any internal investigation of the abuses
in the King case.

G.
H.
(
In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to maintain the independence
of an Inspector General within the Department of
Justice when both the Inspector General and the
Director of the FBI will be responsible to the same
official, the Attorney General.

2. Whether the Inspector General should have \"complete\"
access to Bureau files, including information per-
taining to the identity and reliability of informants
and confidential sources.

3. Whether an Inspector General with access to extremely
sensitive information might not become a serious
threat to the independence of the Bureau from politi-
cal influence and to the civil liberties of American
citizens.
:

Congressional Oversight. In addition to the above
options, the creation of an oversight committee(s) in the
Congress, to which the Bureau would be required to report
and which would have the power to investigate abuses.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the kinds of problems posed by the Justice Department
oversight and Inspector General options discussed above
to the independence of the FBI and the confidentiality
of its files.

Public Reporting and Disclosure to Subjects. In addition
to the above options, the requirement that the FBI make
frequent public reports on the details of its internal
security intelligence programs and policies and reveal
the details of improper intelligence investigations to
the subjects of those investigations.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 10

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to reveal the essence of some
programs and policies and the details of some inves-
tigations without jeopardizing the effectiveness of
legitimate programs.

2. Whether such disclosure might not increase the num-
ber of law suits filed against the FBI alleging
illegal activities.

DRAFT
MEMORANDUM

FBI LEGISLATION PROPOSED OPTIONS
December 4, 1975.

In preparation for the testimony of FBI Director
Kelley and Attorney General Levi on December 9 and 10, the
Domestic Intelligence Task Force is pulling together various
proposals for legislation dealing with FBI intelligence.
This paper sets forth some of the basic options.

A: Current Statutes and Executive Orders

The basic statute governing the FBI is 18 U.S.C. 533,
which reads as follows:

The Attorney General may appoint officials:
(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against
the United States, (2) to assist in the
protection of the person of the President,
and (3) to conduct such other investigations
regarding official matters under the control
of the Department of Justice and the Depart-
ment of State as may be directed by the
Attorney General.

Clauses (2) and (3) are a possible statutory basis
for intelligence investigations going beyond the investigation
of specific federal crimes. Under (2), the FBI may \"assist\" the
Secret Service in the protection of the President by providing

intelligence on persons or groups who may endanger the Presi-
dent's safety. A formal agreement between the FBI and the
Secret Service sets forth the types of intelligence information
provided by the Bureau. However, this agreement states that:
:
-:
:
The FBI will not conduct investigation
of individuals or groups solely for the pur-
pose of establishing whether they constitute
a threat to the safety of the President and
certain other persons unless there is an
indication of a violation of Title 18, U. S.
Code, Section 1751, or other statute over
which the FBI has jurisdiction. (Tab A)
こ

Clause (3) recognizes that the Attorney General may
direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of Justice.\" This is a
possible statutory basis for at least two broad areas of FBI
intelligence investigations civil disturbance intelligence
and intelligence for the Federal Employee Security. Program.

The most recent legal advice to the FBI from the Justice
Department on the gathering and reporting of data regarding
civil disturbances notes that on April 1, 1969, the President
designated the Attorney General as chief civilian officer to
coordinate the government's response to civil disturbances.
The FBI is instructed to gather and report on \"all significant
incidents of civil unrest\" and on \"all disturbances where there
. are believed
are indications that extremist organizations
to be involved in efforts to instigate or exploit them.\" The
:

FBI is spécifically advised to make reports \"even when no
specific violation of federal law is indicated.\" On the other
:
:
hand, the FBI is instructed not to report \"every relatively in-
significant incident of a strictly local nature coming to its
attention.\"
:
(Tab B)

The Justice Department has given the following recent
instructions to the FBI regarding intelligence for the Federal
Employee Security Program. Executive Order 10450, as amended
by Executive Order 11785, is interpreted as requiring an FBI
:
:
:
investigation of organizations \"with a potential\" of violating
federal or state statutes prohibiting unlawful advocacy of vio-
lence or the commission of any unlawful act of violence. The
FBI is advised that \"it is not possible to set definite para-
meters covering the initiation of investigations of potential
organizations falling within the Order.\" The FBI is instructed
to apply \"the same yardstick\" to investigations of individuals
who are affiliated with such organizations. The FBI is specifi-
cally advised that \"it is not necessary that a crime occur
before the investigation is initiated.\" (Tab C)
:

Clause (3) also recognizes that the Attorney General
may direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of State.\" This is a pos-
sible statutory basis for FBI intelligence investigation of
foreign intelligence activities within the United States or to

collect positive foreign intelligence. The best example is
the Attorney General's authorization of warrantless FBI elec-
:
tronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes.
:
However,
there is apparently no instruction from the Justice Department
to the FBI directing the Bureau to initiate investigations of
individuals or organizations which have a marked potential for
use by a foreign intelligence service, but about which there is.
no information indicating intelligence 'activity. (See Staff
Report, \"Counterintelligence/Counterespionage: The Law and
the Philosophy\", October 14, 1975.)
:
:

In his testimony before the Committee, Deputy Associate
FBI Director James Adams made no reference to clauses (2) and
(3) as a possible legal basis for FBI intelligence investiga-
tions going beyond the investigation of specific federal crimes.
Instead, he placed sole reliance on a series of Presidential
directives extending from 1936 until the 1960's which the FBI
interprets as authorizing it to engage in \"domestic security
intelligence investigations\". The Attorney General has codified
these directives in a Justice Department regulation instructing
the FBI to:

Carry out the Presidential directive
of September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presi-
dential directives of January 8, 1943, July
24, 1950, and December 15, 1953, designating
the [FBI) to take charge of investigative
work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,
subversive activities, and related matters.
28 C.F.R., Section 0.85(d).
NW.88614 Docld:32989602 Page 15

:
The FBI also cites directives of President Kennedy on June 9,
1962, and Attorney General Kennedy on March 5, 1964, which
are the latest charter for the Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference, composed of the FBI Director and the chiefs of the
military intelligence agencies. This group is authorized to
coordinate \"all investigation of domestic espionage, counter-
espionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related intelligence
matters affecting internal security.\" (Tab D)

The theory behind the FBI's position is that the Presi-
dent has inherent constitutional powers, at least in the
absence of contrary legislation, to authorize FBI intelligence
activities. The only judicial support for this theory is
language in the Supreme Court's opinion in the Keith case,
which declared warrantless wiretapping of domestic groups un-
:
constitutional.

The Court acknowledged the importance of \"national secu-
rity in its domestic implications especially at a time
of worldwide ferment and when civil disorders in this country
are more prevalent than in the less turbulent periods of our
history.\" Under such circumstances, the Court stated, the
President has a \"fundamental duty\" under the Constitution to
\"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States.\" The Court added, \"Implicit in that duty is the power
to protect our Government against those who would subvert or
overthrow it by unlawful means.\" Hence, the Court appeared to
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 16
:

I
-6
:
recognize that the President's \"domestic security role\" has a
\"constitutional basis\"; that the President through the Attorney
General may need \"to obtain intelligence information about those
who plot unlawful acts against the Government\"; and that \"threats
and acts of sabotage against the Government exist in sufficient
number to justify investigative powers with respect to them.\"
The Court applied the general principle, that \"unless the Govern-
ment safeguards its own capacity to function and to preserve
:
the security of its people, society itself could become so dis-.
ordered that all rights and liberties would be endangered.\"
Nevertheless, the central holding of the Keith decision was that
this power may not be exercised in such a way as to infringe
constitutional rights. 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

Even though the President may have the authority under
the Constitution to direct the FBI to conduct intelligence
investigations in the absence of legislation, Congress has the
ultimate authority to substitute statutory authorization in
place of the Presidential directives. As Justice Robert Jackson
declared in the Steel Seizure Case, \"When the President takes
measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.

B. Option One Ratifying Existing Powers

The first option for Congress is legislation ratifying
the existing. authority granted to the FBI by current Presiden-
tial directives and orders. Such legislation would be cast in
extremely general terms. Its main advantage is that it would
provide a basis for Congressional oversight. It could also
reinforce the Attorney General's role as the immediate super-.
visor of FBI intelligence activities. The statute would
authorize the Attorney General to direct the FBI:

1. to conduct investigations of domestic espionage,
counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive activities;

bances;
..
2. to gather and report information on civil distur-

3. to conduct investigations of other related intelli-
gence matters affecting internal security; and :

4. to conduct investigations of official matters relat-
ing to the Department of State.

In addition, the statute would require the Attorney General
to report annually to the appropriate Congressional committees
on the volume and type of investigations and reports, the
investigative techniques used, and the policies and procedures
adopted by the Justice Department and the FBI.

The weaknesses of this approach are obvious. Congress.
would have legislated a wholesale delegation of power without
:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 18

8
-
standards or limitations other than the supervision of the
Attorney General and oversight by Congress. In view of the
Select Committee's findings as to the vast overbreadth of FBI
domestic intelligence investigations and the abuses committed
in the name of \"counterintelligence\", Congress would in effect
be permitting future expansion of FBI operations to match past
policies.

c. Option Two A Separate Security Intelligence Agency

Congress might give serious consideration to legislation
creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency within the
Justice Department. It would perform the functions of the
present Counterintelligence Branch of the FBI Intelligence
Division; dealing with foreign intelligence and counterintelli-
*gence/counterespionage. The FBI itself has considered this
option as part of the larger question of separating all FBI
intelligence functions from the law enforcement functions of
the Bureau.
(Tab E)

A separate agency would be justified only if it was
authorized to conduct investigations of a wider scope and using
different techniques than would otherwise be permitted. In
other words, Congress could decide that foreign counterintelli-
gence investigations should go beyond investigation of specific
crimes, that techniques such as electronic surveillance should
be used without a warrant or with a special type of warrant,
し
:
竹
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 19

9
:
and that operations should be conducted to \"counter\" foreign
intelligence activities by means other than arrest or \"persona
non grata\" proceedings. On the other hand, if Congress treats
the investigation of foreign intelligence activities the same
as a criminal investigation, then the FBI should keep the job.

Any statute in this area must use general language for
diplomatic reasons. For example, Congress should not explicitly
authorize deception operations or efforts to compromise hostile
intelligence officers, even though such techniques may be
envisioned. Such techniques are dealt with best by establish-
ing adequate procedures for authorization and oversight to
ensure accountability.
:

The legislation should be more specific where it deals
with investigations and other operations directed at American
citizens rather than non-resident aliens in the service of a
foreign power.. If Congress believes Americans should be inves-
tigated if they have a marked potential for use by a foreign
intelligence service, but no information indicating intelligence
activity yet exists, the legislation should say so.

The statute should also set out standards for determin-
ing whether a foreign-dominated domestic organization falls
within the jurisdiction of the separate agency. There should
at the very least be substantial information indicating that
the organization is directed by, subsidized by, or in active
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 20.

:
(The
collaboration with a foreign government or organization.
term \"foreign organization\" refers, for instance, to a group
like the Palestine Liberation Organization.) If the group fits
the criteria for foreign domination, there should be an addi-
tional finding that it may engage in intelligence activities or
in activities involving the use of violence in violations of
federal law.

If the group meets all these standards, Congress may
authorize the investigation of its activities going beyond
regular criminal investigations. Such investigations could
extend to all individuals who are members of, or express sup-
port for, the organization, as well as to the efforts of the
organization to influence and control other groups. However,
it may be sufficient to authorize only the investigation. of
active members and supporters. This would prevent a revival
of the \"Cominfil\" policy of looking into all forms of lawful
political and social activity where Communists might be involv-
ed.

The Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO considered
the need for special supervision of foreign counterintelligence
operations in the United States. It recommended the creation
of a Foreign Intelligence Advisory Commission to make decisions
with regard to the necessity or acceptability of particular
foreign counterintelligence techniques. (Tab F) This proposal
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 21.

11
-
.:
has merit in view of the limited amount of time the Attorney
General can give to personal supervision and the after-the-fact
role of legislative oversight regarding the separate agency.

Finally, legislation to create a separate foreign
counterintelligence agency must deal with relationships to the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, and other
foreign intelligence agencies. The current FBI-CIA agreement
on their respective jurisdictions is only a \"memorandum of under-
standing\". It allows the CIA to undertake certain clandestine
activities within the United States, in coordination with the
FBI. (Tab G) Proposals are currently circulating in the Execu-
tive Branch for a new National Security Council Intelligence
Directive to clarify this matter, as well as to regulate CIA
electronic surveillance of American citizens abroad. (Tab H)

A full draft of a statutory charter for a separate
foreign counterintelligence agency is not included here, since
the focus is on domestic intelligence issues.. However, one
implication of such a statute would be that the remaining FBI
functions should relate only to law enforcement and criminal
investigations.

D. Option Three Elimination of FBI Domestic Intelligence

The basic assumption behind Attorney General Levi's
effort to develop \"guidelines\" for FBI domestic intelligence
is that regular criminal investigations are not adequate to
:
NW 88614 DocId:32989602 Page 22
:

12
1
..
supply the information needed to anticipate or prevent the use
of violence in violations of federal. law. That assumption
should be questioned. Regular criminal investigations are
likely to produce a substantial amount of information which
can be used to anticipate or prevent future crimes. For example,
intensive criminal investigations of Ku Klux Klan violence in
the South during the 1960's would have required the FBI to look
into a wide variety of Klan activities. Another example is the
search for Weatherman fugitives, a regular criminal investiga-
tion which involves broad inquiries across the country.
FBI has not yet demonstrated that the preventive information
it has obtained came from intelligence investigations which
would not have been conducted as regular criminal investigations.
.:
The

The fact that an FBI investigation was supervised by
its Intelligence Division does not necessarily mean that the
investigation was, automatically, outside the regular criminal
law enforcement jurisdiction of the Bureau. Any FBI investiga-
tion of activities involving the use of violence in violations
of federal law falls within that jurisdiction. Moreover

Director Sec'y

On 12/4/75, a meeting was held with the following
representatives of captioned Committee: Chief Counsel F.A.O.
Schwartz; Assistant Counsel Paul Michel; Staff Member Mark
Gitenstein; Staff Director of the Domestic Task Force John T.
Elliff; and Staff Member John Bayley. Representing the Bureau
at this meeting were Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams,
Assistant Director John A. Mintz, Inspector John B. Hotis, and
SA Paul V. Daly.

The meeting discussed the forthcoming testimony on
12/9/75 of the Director before that Committee and Elliff fur-1
nished the Bureau two draft papers discussing the Bureau's
investigative jurisdiction and issues the Committee Staff feels
the Senate Select Committee must address from a legislative
standpoint. Copies of these papers are attached.

The first paper which consists of six pages discusses
in Part 1 what the Committee sees as problems arising out of
the FBI's domestic intelligence investigations. This portion
highlights the fact that these investigations may be overbroad
in scope, collect irrelevant information, and continue the in-
vestigations beyond what the Committee sees as their normal
investigative conclusion. This portion also addresses the
investigative techniques used during these investigations and
the resultant dissemination of information collected.

Under Part 2, the document discusses options available
to the Committee. These options run the gamut from abolition
of the Bureau's domestic intelligence functions to administrative
oversight by the Attorney General or Congressional oversight or
enacting legislation providing for domestic intelligence investi-
gations with legislative limits imposed on such investigations.
Included is the consideration of creating an independent
Inspector General.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

The second position paper which was prepared by
John T. Elliff begins by a six-page statement and analysis
of the Bureau's current authority to conduct domestic in-
telligence investigations. He then lists four options for
the Committee.

Option 1 is for Congress to pass legislation ratifying
the existing FBI authority as set forth by Presidential directives
and Executive Orders.

Option 2 suggests Congress might give serious con-
sideration to creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency
within the Department of Justice. In this Option, Elliff sug-
gests that the FBI itself has considered this Option as part of
the larger question of separating all FBI intelligence functions
from law enforcement functions of the Bureau.

Option 3 considers the elimination of FBI domestic
intelligence. In his analysis of this position, it might be
possible for the Bureau to develop the necessary intelligence
information through its normal criminal investigations and
thus remove the necessity for domestic intelligence investi-
gations as presently conducted.

Option 4 considers setting standards for domestic
intelligence investigations. In this Option, Elliff states
that the FBI should be authorized by statute to conduct domestic
intelligence investigations only as Congress finds that regular
criminal investigations would not provide information to an-
ticipate or prevent the use of violence in violations of Federal
law and that incidents of the use of violence in such violations
are of a serious nature and threaten the security of the country.

For purposes of the Director's appearance on 12/9/75
before the Senate Select Committee, it is believed his response
to questions concerning the aforementioned position papers should
be that the Bureau has received copies and is reviewing the various
proposals and that it would not be appropriate at this time for
the Director to comment regarding the substance of the proposals.

RE: SENSTUDY 75

Elliff indicated during this meeting that the Director
during his appearance may anticipate being asked a question by
one of the Senators relating to his statement before the American
Bar Association in Montreal concerning the necessity for the
sacrifice of certain individual rights at the expense of investi-
gations. He also anticipated the Director might be asked a
question concerning his position on COINTELPRO. Regarding
the question concerning the Director's statement before the
American Bar Association in Montreal, the Legal Counsel Divi-
sion will draft a proposed resonse. Concerning COINTELPRO, a
response has been prepared and will be put together with the
briefing material for the Director.

This memorandum in general highlights the Options
presented in the attached papers. A more detailed analysis
should be prepared by the Intelligence Division and existing
documents addressing these proposals should be made available
for the Director's briefing book for his testimony.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Director respond to questions concerning
the attached position papers as set forth above.

Done.

(2) That the Legal Counsel Division draft a proposed
response concerning the Director's statement made in Montreal
relating to the sacrifice of certain individual rights.

Done.

(3) That the Intelligence Division make a detailed
review of the various Options set forth in the two attached
position papers. (FOR SUBSEQUENT STAFF CONFEE CA

Issues and Options for Discussion with
Former Attorneys General Rogers, Katzenbach, and Clark

I. Background

MDR-16
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 10/31/00 BY SP2AUMKP

In the past few weeks the staff has presented the Committee
with evidence suggesting the following about the FBI's
internal security intelligence program:

A. The program is massive, involving the collection of
information on the activities of thousands of innocent,
law-abiding American citizens.

B. These individuals were not alleged espionage agents, but
citizens who fall within the FBI's vague definitions of
\"subversion\" and \"extremism\" purely homegrown \"threats
to the national security\".

C. That FBI policy on \"subversive\" and \"extremist\" inves-
tigations was vague and subject to the following abuses:

1. overbreadth in scope in that groups were investigated
whose threats to the national security were tenuous,
if not non-existent.

2. collection of information on the personal life and
political views of subjects unrelated to the national
security.

3. the continuance of investigations well after it
should have become obvious that there was no legiti-
mate predicate.

D. Particularly invasive collection techniques were used,
including electronic surveillance, mail opening, and sur-
reptitious entries. Although these have been terminated,
the predominant and perhaps most insidious continues
today through the FBI's huge informant/confidential source
network.

E. Information collected in the course of these investiga-
tions is disseminated regularly throughout the federal
government and to local law enforcement.

F. Until 1971, information collected through these investi-
gations was disseminated as part of the COINTELPRO pro-
gram to the subjects' friends, relatives, employers, and
others in an effort to discredit or \"neutralize\" alleged
\"subversives\" or \"extremists\". 2-1116 393

- 2 -

G. The FBI's internal security intelligence program was
used by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard
Nixon to serve their political interests, usually by
collecting information on critics or political
opponents.

H. The program was conceived and implemented in secrecy,
and although parts of the program were shared with out-
side authorities from time to time, until now no
President, Attorney General, or Congressional committee
has been exposed to the entire program in detail.

I. The program is not authorized by statute but is founded
on a series of secret or ambiguous Presidential orders,
which in turn are based upon a questionable assertion
of \"inherent constitutional authority\".

J. The program continues today, albeit on a much more
limited basis than in the late 1960's and early 1970's,
and the basic machinery for the program the huge
informant/confidential source network is still
operating.

K. There is no statute or internal Bureau or Justice Depart-
ment policy prohibiting a new Director, Attorney General,
or President from ordering the Bureau to expand the pro-
gram to its earlier dimensions.

II. Issues and Options

Among the issues and options which might be discussed with
former Attorneys General in response to what the Committee
has learned are the following:

A. Abolition. Elimination of the FBI internal security
intelligence program as Attorney General Harlan Stone
ordered in 1924 when confronted with abuses growing out
of the FBI's first internal security intelligence pro-
gram, such as the infamous Palmer raids.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether there are not some functions (e.g., protecting
the President, preventing or at least predicting
violence by terrorist organizations, or predicting
civil disorders) which require intelligence collec-
tion.

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-6-
1

- 3 -

2. Whether FBI intelligence reports are valuable in
that respect, especially in light of a recent GAO
report suggesting that such reports are rarely use-
ful in predicting violent activity.

3. Whether such information, assuming it is valuable,
could not be obtained through more traditional criminal
investigations.

4. Whether the value of the information, marginal or
otherwise, justifies the risk to civil liberties
inherent in such intelligence collection.

5. Whether, given the way in which limited and ambiguous
grants of authority have been expanded into major
authorizations,any statute short of a total prohibi-
tion of all non-law enforcement intelligence activi
ties in the domestic sector will be adequate to pre-
vent the recurrences of the kinds of abuses uncovered
by this Committee. (Or, conversely, whether it is
possible to draft a law authorizing a limited civil
disturbance and counter-terrorist intelligence mission
that will not eventually evolve, like the National
Security Act of 1947, into a charter for unanticipated
and unwanted covert activities.)

6. Whether it would be sufficient to restrict the FBI
to criminal investigations without also (a) placing
limits upon the length of investigations, (b) the
kinäs of information which can be collected and dis-
seminated on the subject irrelevant to the alleged
criminal act, (c) the utilization of warrantless
electronic surveillance and other particularly inva-
sive collection techniques, and (d) the utilization
of a huge informant/confidential source network with-
out judicial or Justice Department supervision.

B. Authorizing Statute. Recognition of the value of
internal security intelligence, but placing limits upon
the program designed to minimize the infringement upon
civil liberties, an option being actively considered by
the present Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out under the first option and,
in addition:

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-7-
1

- 4 -

1. Whether meaningful and stringent guidelines can be
written which do not so hamper the administration
of an internal security intelligence program as to
make the product not just marginal, as GAO suggests,
but worthless.*

2. In light of the possibility that the present Attorney
General may address this matter via internal Justice
Department guidelines, whether this approach does
not ignore the legal authority question which can
only be resolved by statute.

3. Whether or not Congress could draft a statutory ver-
sion of the guidelines which could be flexible enough
to meet an evolving threat and at the same time
place meaningful restrictions upon the program.

4. Even assuming there is no absence of legal authority,
is it safe to leave these guidelines in the form of a
departmental order which can be rescinded by the next
Attorney General?

C. Delegation of Authority to Attorney General. Simply
ratifying the present program via enactment of a statutory
charter which grants the FBI authority to conduct an
internal security intelligence program subject to its own
internal guidelines or departmental guidelines as proposed
by the Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and:

1. Whether such a statute would not be an unconstitu-
tional delegation of powers to the Executive Branch.

2. Whether enactment of such a statute 'would not repre-
sent a failure by the Congress to confront the issues
raised above.

*A preliminary staff analysis of the Attorney General's draft
guidelines suggests that, despite months of conscientious and
painstaking work by a departmental task force, the guidelines
are not adequate. This analysis, which will be presented when
Attorney General Levi testifies on December 10, indicates that
several of the more questionable FBI investigations (e.g., of
Dr. King and the women's liberation movement) would still be
permissible under these proposed guidelines.

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-8-

- 5 -

D. Legislative Inaction. Enact no new statute affecting
the FBI's legal authority or the internal security intel-
ligence program.
:
In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and, in addition:

1. Whether this failure to act might not leave the
status of the program in doubt and subject to court
challenge.

2. Whether this failure to act after full disclosure
by the Bureau might not be taken by the FBI and the
courts as a ratification of the program.

E. Administrative Oversight by the Attorney General. The
Justice Department should be required to exercise greater
administrative oversight over the FBI's internal security
intelligence program by Attorney General Levi, regardless
of whatever other options Congress accepts.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is practical for the Attorney General or
his staff to review thousands of such investigations
each year.

2. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should
review all or just the so-called \"full\" investiga-
tions.

3. Whether, to facilitate the conduct of such reviews,
the Attorney General or his staff should be given
\"complete\" access to Bureau files, including informa-
tion regarding the identity and reliability of infor-
mants and confidential sources.

4. Whether it is possible to develop a staff of career
attorneys within the Department with both the access.
and independence essential to the conduct of search-
ing reviews.

5. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should not
also be required to review various informant and so-
called \"intensification\" programs, and the establish-
ment of specialized indices (which have a significant
impact upon which cases are opened) instead of just
reviewing individual investigations in a vacuum as
provided by the Attorney General's draft guidelines.

F. An. Inspector General. In addition to the above options,
an independent Inspector General should be created to
investigate improprieties by the FBI. This option is
advanced by those concerned about the inadequacy of the
FBI's investigation of the disappearance of former
Director Hoover's personal files, its limited inquiry
into the so-called Atlantic City convention case, and
the absence of any internal investigation of the abuses
in the King case.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to maintain the independence
of an Inspector General within the Department of
Justice when both the Inspector General and the
Director of the FBI will be responsible to the same
official, the Attorney General.

2. Whether the Inspector General should have \"complete\"
access to Bureau files, including information per-
taining to the identity and reliability of informants
and confidential sources.

3. Whether an Inspector General with access to extremely
sensitive information might not become a serious
threat to the independence of the Bureau from politi-
cal influence and to the civil liberties of American
citizens.

G. Congressional Oversight. In addition to the above
options, the creation of an oversight committee(s) in the
Congress, to which the Bureau would be required to report
and which would have the power to investigate abuses.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the kinds of problems posed by the Justice Department
oversight and Inspector General options discussed above
to the independence of the FBI and the confidentiality
of its files.

H. Public Reporting and Disclosure to Subjects. In addition
to the above options, the requirement that the FBI make
frequent public reports on the details of its internal
security intelligence programs and policies and reveal
the details of improper intelligence investigations to
the subjects of those investigations.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to reveal the essence of some
programs and policies and the details of some inves-
tigations without jeopardizing the effectiveness of
legitimate programs.

2. Whether such disclosure might not increase the num-
ber of law suits filed against the FBI alleging
illegal activities.

FBI LEGISLATION PROPOSED OPTIONS

In preparation for the testimony of FBI Director
Kelley and Attorney General Levi on December 9 and 10, the
Domestic Intelligence Task Force is pulling together various
proposals for legislation dealing with FBI intelligence.
This paper sets forth some of the basic options.

A: Current Statutes and Executive Orders

The basic statute governing the FBI is 18 U.S.C. 533,
which reads as follows:

The Attorney General may appoint officials:
(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against
the United States, (2) to assist in the
protection of the person of the President,
and (3) to conduct such other investigations
regarding official matters under the control
of the Department of Justice and the Depart-
ment of State as may be directed by the
Attorney General.

Clauses (2) and (3) are a possible statutory basis
for intelligence investigations going beyond the investigation
of specific federal crimes. Under (2), the FBI may \"assist\" the
Secret Service in the protection of the President by providing

intelligence on persons or groups who may endanger the Presi-
dent's safety. A formal agreement between the FBI and the
Secret Service sets forth the types of intelligence information
provided by the Bureau. However, this agreement states that:

The FBI will not conduct investigation
of individuals or groups solely for the pur-
pose of establishing whether they constitute
a threat to the safety of the President and
certain other persons unless there is an
indication of a violation of Title 18, U. S.
Code, Section 1751, or other statute over
which the FBI has jurisdiction. (Tab A)

Clause (3) recognizes that the Attorney General may
direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of Justice.\" This is a
possible statutory basis for at least two broad areas of FBI
intelligence investigations civil disturbance intelligence
and intelligence for the Federal Employee Security Program.

The most recent legal advice to the FBI from the Justice
Department on the gathering and reporting of data regarding
civil disturbances notes that on April 1, 1969, the President
designated the Attorney General as chief civilian officer to
coordinate the government's response to civil disturbances.
The FBI is instructed to gather and report on \"all significant
incidents of civil unrest\" and on \"all disturbances where there
are indications that extremist organizations are believed
to be involved in efforts to instigate or exploit them.\" The

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-13-

- 3 -

FBI is spécifically advised to make reports \"even when no
specific violation of federal law is indicated.\" On the other

hand, the FBI is instructed not to report \"every relatively in-
significant incident of a strictly local nature coming to its
attention.\" (Tab B)

The Justice Department has given the following recent
instructions to the FBI regarding intelligence for the Federal
Employee Security Program. Executive Order 10450, as amended
by Executive Order 11785, is interpreted as requiring an FBI

investigation of organizations \"with a potential\" of violating
federal or state statutes prohibiting unlawful advocacy of vio-
lence or the commission of any unlawful act of violence. The
FBI is advised that \"it is not possible to set definite para-
meters covering the initiation of investigations of potential
organizations falling within the Order.\" The FBI is instructed
to apply \"the same yardstick\" to investigations of individuals
who are affiliated with such organizations. The FBI is specifi-
cally advised that \"it is not necessary that a crime occur
before the investigation is initiated.\" (Tab C)

Clause (3) also recognizes that the Attorney General
may direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of State.\" This is a pos-
sible statutory basis for FBI intelligence investigation of
foreign intelligence activities within the United States or to

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-14-

- 4 -

collect positive foreign intelligence. The best example is
the Attorney General's authorization of warrantless FBI elec-

tronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. However,
there is apparently no instruction from the Justice Department
to the FBI directing the Bureau to initiate investigations of
individuals or organizations which have a marked potential for
use by a foreign intelligence service, but about which there is.
no information indicating intelligence 'activity. (See Staff
Report, \"Counterintelligence/Counterespionage: The Law and
the Philosophy\", October 14, 1975.)

In his testimony before the Committee, Deputy Associate
FBI Director James Adams made no reference to clauses (2) and
(3) as a possible legal basis for FBI intelligence investiga-
tions going beyond the investigation of specific federal crimes.
Instead, he placed sole reliance on a series of Presidential
directives extending from 1936 until the 1960's which the FBI
interprets as authorizing it to engage in \"domestic security
intelligence investigations\". The Attorney General has codified
these directives in a Justice Department regulation instructing
the FBI to:

Carry out the Presidential directive
of September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presi-
dential directives of January 8, 1943, July
24, 1950, and December 15, 1953, designating
the [FBI) to take charge of investigative
work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,
subversive activities, and related matters.
28 C.F.R., Section 0.85(d).

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-15-

- 5 -

The FBI also cites directives of President Kennedy on June 9,
1962, and Attorney General Kennedy on March 5, 1964, which
are the latest charter for the Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference, composed of the FBI Director and the chiefs of the
military intelligence agencies. This group is authorized to
coordinate \"all investigation of domestic espionage, counter-
espionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related intelligence
matters affecting internal security.\" (Tab D)

The theory behind the FBI's position is that the Presi-
dent has inherent constitutional powers, at least in the
absence of contrary legislation, to authorize FBI intelligence
activities. The only judicial support for this theory is
language in the Supreme Court's opinion in the Keith case,
which declared warrantless wiretapping of domestic groups un-

constitutional.

The Court acknowledged the importance of \"national secu-
rity in its domestic implications especially at a time
of worldwide ferment and when civil disorders in this country
are more prevalent than in the less turbulent periods of our
history.\" Under such circumstances, the Court stated, the
President has a \"fundamental duty\" under the Constitution to
\"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States.\" The Court added, \"Implicit in that duty is the power
to protect our Government against those who would subvert or
overthrow it by unlawful means.\" Hence, the Court appeared to

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-16-

-6

recognize that the President's \"domestic security role\" has a
\"constitutional basis\"; that the President through the Attorney
General may need \"to obtain intelligence information about those
who plot unlawful acts against the Government\"; and that \"threats
and acts of sabotage against the Government exist in sufficient
number to justify investigative powers with respect to them.\"
The Court applied the general principle, that \"unless the Govern-
ment safeguards its own capacity to function and to preserve

the security of its people, society itself could become so dis-.
ordered that all rights and liberties would be endangered.\"
Nevertheless, the central holding of the Keith decision was that
this power may not be exercised in such a way as to infringe
constitutional rights. 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

Even though the President may have the authority under
the Constitution to direct the FBI to conduct intelligence
investigations in the absence of legislation, Congress has the
ultimate authority to substitute statutory authorization in
place of the Presidential directives. As Justice Robert Jackson
declared in the Steel Seizure Case, \"When the President takes
measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.
343 U.S. 579,
637.

B. Option One Ratifying Existing Powers

The first option for Congress is legislation ratifying
the existing authority granted to the FBI by current Presiden-
tial directives and orders. Such legislation would be cast in
extremely general terms. Its main advantage is that it would
provide a basis for Congressional oversight. It could also
reinforce the Attorney General's role as the immediate super-.
visor of FBI intelligence activities. The statute would
authorize the Attorney General to direct the FBI:

1. to conduct investigations of domestic espionage,
counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive activities;

2. to gather and report information on civil distur-
bances;

3. to conduct investigations of other related intelli-
gence matters affecting internal security; and :

4. to conduct investigations of official matters relat-
ing to the Department of State.

In addition, the statute would require the Attorney General
to report annually to the appropriate Congressional committees
on the volume and type of investigations and reports, the
investigative techniques used, and the policies and procedures
adopted by the Justice Department and the FBI.

The weaknesses of this approach are obvious. Congress.
would have legislated a wholesale delegation of power without

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-18-

- 8 -

standards or limitations other than the supervision of the
Attorney General and oversight by Congress. In view of the
Select Committee's findings as to the vast overbreadth of FBI
domestic intelligence investigations and the abuses committed
in the name of \"counterintelligence\", Congress would in effect
be permitting future expansion of FBI operations to match past
policies.

C. Option Two A Separate Security Intelligence Agency

Congress might give serious consideration to legislation
creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency within the
Justice Department. It would perform the functions of the
present Counterintelligence Branch of the FBI Intelligence
Division; dealing with foreign intelligence and counterintelli-
gence/counterespionage. The FBI itself has considered this
option as part of the larger question of separating all FBI
intelligence functions from the law enforcement functions of
the Bureau. (Tab E)

A separate agency would be justified only if it was
authorized to conduct investigations of a wider scope and using
different techniques than would otherwise be permitted. In
other words, Congress could decide that foreign counterintelli-
gence investigations should go beyond investigation of specific
crimes, that techniques such as electronic surveillance should
be used without a warrant or with a special type of warrant,
し

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-19

- 9 -

and that operations should be conducted to \"counter\" foreign
intelligence activities by means other than arrest or \"persona
non grata\" proceedings. On the other hand, if Congress treats
the investigation of foreign intelligence activities the same
as a criminal investigation, then the FBI should keep the job.

Any statute in this area must use general language for
diplomatic reasons. For example, Congress should not explicitly
authorize deception operations or efforts to compromise hostile
intelligence officers, even though such techniques may be
envisioned. Such techniques are dealt with best by establish-
ing adequate procedures for authorization and oversight to
ensure accountability.

The legislation should be more specific where it deals
with investigations and other operations directed at American
citizens rather than non-resident aliens in the service of a
foreign power.. If Congress believes Americans should be inves-
tigated if they have a marked potential for use by a foreign
intelligence service, but no information indicating intelligence
activity yet exists, the legislation should say so.

The statute should also set out standards for determin-
ing whether a foreign-dominated domestic organization falls
within the jurisdiction of the separate agency. There should
at the very least be substantial information indicating that
the organization is directed by, subsidized by, or in active

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-20.

- 10 -

collaboration with a foreign government or organization. (The
term \"foreign organization\" refers, for instance, to a group
like the Palestine Liberation Organization.) If the group fits
the criteria for foreign domination, there should be an addi-
tional finding that it may engage in intelligence activities or
in activities involving the use of violence in violations of
federal law.

If the group meets all these standards, Congress may
authorize the investigation of its activities going beyond
regular criminal investigations. Such investigations could
extend to all individuals who are members of, or express sup-
port for, the organization, as well as to the efforts of the
organization to influence and control other groups. However,
it may be sufficient to authorize only the investigation. of
active members and supporters. This would prevent a revival
of the \"Cominfil\" policy of looking into all forms of lawful
political and social activity where Communists might be involv-
ed.

The Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO considered
the need for special supervision of foreign counterintelligence
operations in the United States. It recommended the creation
of a Foreign Intelligence Advisory Commission to make decisions
with regard to the necessity or acceptability of particular
foreign counterintelligence techniques. (Tab F) This proposal

NW 88614-Docld:32989602-Page-21.

- 11 -

has merit in view of the limited amount of time the Attorney
General can give to personal supervision and the after-the-fact
role of legislative oversight regarding the separate agency.

Finally, legislation to create a separate foreign
counterintelligence agency must deal with relationships to the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, and other
foreign intelligence agencies. The current FBI-CIA agreement
on their respective jurisdictions is only a \"memorandum of under-
standing\". It allows the CIA to undertake certain clandestine
activities within the United States, in coordination with the
FBI. (Tab G) Proposals are currently circulating in the Execu-
tive Branch for a new National Security Council Intelligence
Directive to clarify this matter, as well as to regulate CIA
electronic surveillance of American citizens abroad. (Tab H)

A full draft of a statutory charter for a separate
foreign counterintelligence agency is not included here, since
the focus is on domestic intelligence issues.. However, one
implication of such a statute would be that the remaining FBI
functions should relate only to law enforcement and criminal
investigations.

D. Option Three Elimination of FBI Domestic Intelligence

The basic assumption behind Attorney General Levi's
effort to develop \"guidelines\" for FBI domestic intelligence
is that regular criminal investigations are not adequate to

NW 88614-DocId:32989602-Page-22

- 12 -

supply the information needed to anticipate or prevent the use
of violence in violations of federal. law. That assumption
should be questioned. Regular criminal investigations are
likely to produce a substantial amount of information which
can be used to anticipate or prevent future crimes. For example,
intensive criminal investigations of Ku Klux Klan violence in
the South during the 1960's would have required the FBI to look
into a wide variety of Klan activities. Another example is the
search for Weatherman fugitives, a regular criminal investiga-
tion which involves broad inquiries across the country. The
FBI has not yet demonstrated that the preventive information
it has obtained came from intelligence investigations which
would not have been conducted as regular criminal investigations.
.:

The fact that an FBI investigation was supervised by
its Intelligence Division does not necessarily mean that the
investigation was, automatically, outside the regular criminal
law enforcement jurisdiction of the Bureau. Any FBI investiga-
tion of activities involving the use of violence in violations
of federal law falls within that jurisdiction. Moreover,
regular criminal investigations can also extend to plans,
attempts, or conspiracies to engage in such activities.

One suggested difference between intelligence-type and
regular criminal investigations is that the latter are
terminated after a reasonable

On 12/4/75, a meeting was held with the following
representatives of captioned Committee: Chief Counsel F.A.O.
Schwartz; Assistant Counsel Paul Michel; Staff Member Mark
Gitenstein; Staff Director of the Domestic Task Force John T.
Elliff; and Staff Member John Bayley. Representing the Bureau
at this meeting were Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams,
Assistant Director John A. Mintz, Inspector John B. Hotis, and
SA Paul V. Daly.

The meeting discussed the forthcoming testimony on
12/9/75 of the Director before that Committee and Elliff fur-1
nished the Bureau two draft papers discussing the Bureau's
investigative jurisdiction and issues the Committee Staff feels
the Senate Select Committee must address from a legislative
standpoint. Copies of these papers are attached.

The first paper which consists of six pages discusses
in Part 1 what the Committee sees as problems arising out of
the FBI's domestic intelligence investigations. This portion
highlights the fact that these investigations may be overbroad
in scope, collect irrelevant information, and continue the in-
vestigations beyond what the Committee sees as their normal
investigative conclusion. This portion also addresses the
investigative techniques used during these investigations and
the resultant dissemination of information collected.

Under Part 2, the document discusses options available
to the Committee. These options run the gamut from abolition
of the Bureau's domestic intelligence functions to administrative
oversight by the Attorney General or Congressional oversight or
enacting legislation providing for domestic intelligence investi-
gations with legislative limits imposed on such investigations.
Included is the consideration of creating an independent
Inspector General.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

The second position paper which was prepared by
John T. Elliff begins by a six-page statement and analysis
of the Bureau's current authority to conduct domestic in-
telligence investigations. He then lists four options for
the Committee.

Option 1 is for Congress to pass legislation ratifying
the existing FBI authority as set forth by Presidential directives
and Executive Orders.

Option 2 suggests. Congress might give serious con-
sideration to creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency
within the Department of Justice. In this Option, Elliff sug-
gests that the FBI itself has considered this Option as part of
the larger question of separating all FBI intelligence functions
from law enforcement functions of the Bureau.

Option 3. considers the elimination of FBI domestic
intelligence. In his analysis of this position, it might be
possible for the Bureau to develop the necessary intelligence
information through its normal criminal investigations and
thus remove the necessity for domestic intelligence investi-
gations as presently conducted.

Option 4 considers setting standards for domestic
intelligence investigations. In this. Option, Elliff states
that the FBI should be authorized by statute to conduct domestic
intelligence investigations only as Congress finds that regular
criminal investigations would not provide information to an-
ticipate or prevent the use of violence in violations of Federal
law and that incidents of the use of violence in such violations
are of a serious nature and threaten the security of the country.

For purposes of the Director's appearance on 12/9/75
before the Senate Select Committee, it is believed his response
to questions concerning the aforementioned position papers should
be that the Bureau has received copies and is reviewing the various
proposals and that it would not be appropriate at this time for
the Director to comment regarding the substance of the proposals.

RE: SENSTUDY 75

Elliff indicated during this meeting that the Director
during his appearance may anticipate being asked a question by
one of the Senators relating to his statement before the American
Bar Association in Montreal concerning the necessity for the
sacrifice of certain individual rights at the expense of investi-
gations. He also anticipated the Director might be asked a
question concerning his position on COINTELPRO. Regarding
the question concerning the Director's statement before the
American Bar Association in Montreal, the Legal Counsel Divi-
sion will draft a proposed resonse. Concerning COINTELPRO, a
response has been prepared and will be put together with the
briefing material for the Director.

This memorandum in general highlights the Options
presented in the attached papers. A more detailed analysis
should be prepared by the Intelligence Division and existing
documents addressing these proposals should be made available
for the Director's briefing book for his testimony.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Director respond to questions concerning
the attached position papers as set forth above.

Done.

(2) That the Legal Counsel Division draft a proposed
response concerning the Director's statement made in Montreal
relating to the sacrifice of certain individual rights.

Done.

(3) That the Intelligence Division make a detailed
review of the various Options set forth in the two attached
position papers. (FOR SUBSEQUENT STAFF CONFEE CA

Issues and Options for Discussion with
Former Attorneys General Rogers, Katzenbach, and Clark

Background

MDR-16
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 10/31/00 BY SPALMKP

In the past few weeks the staff has presented the Committee
with evidence suggesting the following about the FBI's
internal security intelligence program:

A. The program is massive, involving the collection of
information on the activities of thousands of innocent,
law-abiding American citizens.

B. These individuals were not alleged espionage agents, but
citizens who fall within the FBI's vague definitions of
\"subversion\" and \"extremism\" purely homegrown \"threats
to the national security\".

C. That FBI policy on \"subversive\" and \"extremist\" inves-
tigations was vague and subject to the following abuses:

1. overbreadth in scope in that groups were investigated
whose threats to the national security were tenuous,
if not non-existent.

2. collection of information on the personal life and
political views of subjects unrelated to the national
security.

3. the continuance of investigations well after it
should have become obvious that there was no legiti-
mate predicate.

D. Particularly invasive collection techniques were used,
including electronic surveillance, mail opening, and sur-
reptitious entries. Although these have been terminated,
the predominant and perhaps most insidious continues
today through the FBI's huge informant/confidential source
network.

E. Information collected in the course of these investiga-
tions is disseminated regularly throughout the federal
government and to local law enforcement.

F. Until 1971, information collected through these investi-
gations was disseminated as part of the COINTELPRO pro-
gram to the subjects' friends, relatives, employers, and
others in an effort to discredit or \"neutralize\" alleged
extre 2-1116 393
\"subversives\" or \"extremists\".

II.

G. The FBI's internal security intelligence program was
used by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard
Nixon to serve their political interests, usually by
collecting information on critics or political
opponents.

H. The program was conceived and implemented in secrecy,
and although parts of the program were shared with out-
side authorities from time to time, until now no
President, Attorney General, or Congressional committee
has been exposed to the entire program in detail.

I The program is not authorized by statute but is founded
on a series of secret or ambiguous Presidential orders,
which in turn are based upon a questionable assertion
of \"inherent constitutional authority\".

J. The program continues today, albeit on a much more
limited basis than in the late 1960's and early 1970's,
and the basic machinery for the program the huge
informant/confidential source network is still
operating...

Κ. There is no statute or internal Bureau or Justice Depart-
'ment policy prohibiting a new Director, Attorney General,
or President from ordering the Bureau to expand the pro-
gram to its earlier dimensions.

Issues and Options

Among the issues and options which might be discussed with
former Attorneys General in response to what the Committee
has learned are the following:

A. Abolition. Elimination of the FBI internal security
intelligence program as Attorney General Harlan Stone
ordered in 1924 when confronted with abuses growing out
of the FBI's first internal security intelligence pro-
gram, such as the infamous Palmer raids.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether there are not some functions (e.g., protecting
the President, preventing or at least predicting
violence by terrorist organizations, or predicting
civil disorders) which require intelligence collec-
tion.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 6

B.

J

2. Whether FBI intelligence reports are valuable in
that respect, especially in light of a recent GAO
report suggesting that such reports are rarely use-
ful in predicting violent activity.

3. Whether such information, assuming it is valuable,
could not be obtained through more traditional criminal
investigations.

4. Whether the value of the information, marginal or
otherwise, justifies the risk to civil liberties
inherent in such intelligence collection.

5. Whether, given the way in which limited and ambiguous
grants of authority have been expanded into major
authorizations,any statute short of a total prohibi-
tion of all non-law enforcement intelligence activi
ties in the domestic sector will be adequate to pre-
vent the recurrences of the kinds of abuses uncovered
by this Committee. (Or, conversely, whether it is
possible to draft a law authorizing a limited civil
disturbance and counter-terrorist intelligence mission
that will not eventually evolve, like the National
Security Act of 1947, into a charter for unanticipated
and unwanted covert activities.)

6. Whether it would be sufficient to restrict the FBI
to criminal investigations without also (a) placing
limits upon the length of investigations, (b) the
kinäs of information which can be collected and dis-
seminated on the subject irrelevant to the alleged
criminal act, (c). the utilization of warrantless
electronic surveillance and other particularly inva-
sive collection techniques, and (d) the utilization
of a huge informant/confidential source network with-
out judicial or Justice Department supervision.

Authorizing Statute. Recognition of the value of
internal security intelligence, but placing limits upon
the program designed to minimize the infringement upon
civil liberties, an option being actively considered by
the present Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out under the first option and,
in addition:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 7

C.

1. Whether meaningful and stringent guidelines can be
written which do not so hamper the administration
of an internal security intelligence program as to
make the product not just marginal, as GAO suggests,
but worthless.*

2. In light of the possibility that the present Attorney
General may address this matter via internal Justice
Department guidelines, whether this approach does
not ignore the legal authority question which can
only be resolved by statute.

3. Whether or not Congress could draft a statutory ver-
sion of the guidelines which could be flexible enough
to meet an evolving threat and at the same time
place meaningful restrictions upon the program.

4. Even assuming there is no absence of legal authority,
is it safe to leave these guidelines in the form of a
departmental order which can be rescinded by the next
Attorney General?

Delegation of Authority to Attorney General. Simply
ratifying the present program via enactment of a statutory
charter which grants the FBI authority to conduct an
internal security intelligence program subject to its own
internal guidelines or departmental guidelines as proposed
by the Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and:

1. Whether such a statute would not be an unconstitu-
tional delegation of powers to the Executive Branch.

2. Whether enactment of such a statute 'would not repre-
sent a failure by the Congress to confront the issues
raised above.

*A preliminary staff analysis of the Attorney General's draft
guidelines suggests that, despite months of conscientious and
painstaking work by a departmental task force, the guidelines
are not adequate. This analysis, which will be presented when
Attorney General Levi testifies on December 10, indicates that
several of the more questionable FBI investigations (e.g., of
Dr. King and the women's liberation movement) would still be
permissible under these proposed guidelines.

Legislative Inaction. Enact no new statute affecting
the FBI's legal authority or the internal security intel-
ligence program.
:
In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and, in addition:

1. Whether this failure to act might not leave the
status of the program in doubt and subject to court
challenge.

2. :
Whether this failure to act after full disclosure
by the Bureau might not be taken by the FBI and the
courts as a ratification of the program.

Administrative Oversight by the Attorney General. The
Justice Department should be required to exercise greater
administrative oversight over the FBI's internal security
intelligence program by Attorney General Levi, regardless
of whatever other options Congress accepts.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is practical for the Attorney General or
his staff to review thousands of such investigations
each year.

2. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should
review all or just the so-called \"full\" investiga-
tions.

3. Whether, to facilitate the conduct of such reviews,
the Attorney General or his staff should be given
\"complete\" access to Bureau files, including informa-
tion regarding the identity and reliability of infor-
mants and confidential sources.

4. Whether it is possible to develop a staff of career
attorneys within the Department with both the access.
and independence essential to the conduct of search-
ing reviews.

5. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should not
also be required to review various informant and so-
called \"intensification\" programs, and the establish-
ment of specialized indices (which have a significant
impact upon which cases are opened) instead of just
reviewing individual investigations in a vacuum as
provided by the Attorney General's draft guidelines.

An. Inspector General. In addition to the above options,
an independent Inspector General should be created to
investigate improprieties by the FBI. This option is
advanced by those concerned about the inadequacy of the
FBI's investigation of the disappearance of former
Director Hoover's personal files, its limited inquiry
into the so-called Atlantic City convention case, and
the absence of any internal investigation of the abuses
in the King case.

G. Congressional Oversight. In addition to the above
options, the creation of an oversight committee(s) in the
Congress, to which the Bureau would be required to report
and which would have the power to investigate abuses.

H. Public Reporting and Disclosure to Subjects. In addition
to the above options, the requirement that the FBI make
frequent public reports on the details of its internal
security intelligence programs and policies and reveal
the details of improper intelligence investigations to
the subjects of those investigations.
(
In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to maintain the independence
of an Inspector General within the Department of
Justice when both the Inspector General and the
Director of the FBI will be responsible to the same
official, the Attorney General.

2. Whether the Inspector General should have \"complete\"
access to Bureau files, including information per-
taining to the identity and reliability of informants
and confidential sources.

3. Whether an Inspector General with access to extremely
sensitive information might not become a serious
threat to the independence of the Bureau from politi-
cal influence and to the civil liberties of American
citizens.
:
In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the kinds of problems posed by the Justice Department
oversight and Inspector General options discussed above
to the independence of the FBI and the confidentiality
of its files.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to reveal the essence of some
programs and policies and the details of some inves-
tigations without jeopardizing the effectiveness of
legitimate programs.

2. Whether such disclosure might not increase the num-
ber of law suits filed against the FBI alleging
illegal activities.

DRAFT
MEMORANDUM
FBI LEGISLATION PROPOSED OPTIONS
December 4, 1975.

In preparation for the testimony of FBI Director
Kelley and Attorney General Levi on December 9 and 10, the
Domestic Intelligence Task Force is pulling together various
proposals for legislation dealing with FBI intelligence.
This paper sets forth some of the basic options.

A: Current Statutes and Executive Orders

The basic statute governing the FBI is 18 U.S.C. 533,
which reads as follows:

The Attorney General may appoint officials:
(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against
the United States, (2) to assist in the
protection of the person of the President,
and (3) to conduct such other investigations
regarding official matters under the control
of the Department of Justice and the Depart-
ment of State as may be directed by the
Attorney General.

Clauses (2) and (3) are a possible statutory basis
for intelligence investigations going beyond the investigation
of specific federal crimes. Under (2), the FBI may \"assist\" the
Secret Service in the protection of the President by providing

intelligence on persons or groups who may endanger the Presi-
dent's safety. A formal agreement between the FBI and the
Secret Service sets forth the types of intelligence information
provided by the Bureau. However, this agreement states that:
:
-:
:
The FBI will not conduct investigation
of individuals or groups solely for the pur-
pose of establishing whether they constitute
a threat to the safety of the President and
certain other persons unless there is an
indication of a violation of Title 18, U. S.
Code, Section 1751, or other statute over
which the FBI has jurisdiction. (Tab A)
Clause (3) recognizes that the Attorney General may
direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of Justice.\" This is a
possible statutory basis for at least two broad areas of FBI
intelligence investigations civil disturbance intelligence
and intelligence for the Federal Employee Security. Program.

The most recent legal advice to the FBI from the Justice
Department on the gathering and reporting of data regarding
civil disturbances notes that on April 1, 1969, the President
designated the Attorney General as chief civilian officer to
coordinate the government's response to civil disturbances.
The FBI is instructed to gather and report on \"all significant
incidents of civil unrest\" and on \"all disturbances where there
. are believed
are indications that extremist organizations
to be involved in efforts to instigate or exploit them.\" The
:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 13

FBI is spécifically advised to make reports \"even when no
specific violation of federal law is indicated.\" On the other
:
:
hand, the FBI is instructed not to report \"every relatively in-
significant incident of a strictly local nature coming to its
attention.\" : (Tab B)

The Justice Department has given the following recent
instructions to the FBI regarding intelligence for the Federal
Employee Security Program. Executive Order 10450, as amended
by Executive Order 11785, is interpreted as requiring an FBI
:
:
:
investigation of organizations \"with a potential\" of violating
federal or state statutes prohibiting unlawful advocacy of vio-
lence or the commission of any unlawful act of violence. The
FBI is advised that \"it is not possible to set definite para-
meters covering the initiation of investigations of potential
organizations falling within the Order.\" The FBI is instructed
to apply \"the same yardstick\" to investigations of individuals
who are affiliated with such organizations. The FBI is specifi-
cally advised that \"it is not necessary that a crime occur
before the investigation is initiated.\" (Tab C)
:
Clause (3) also recognizes that the Attorney General
may direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of State.\" This is a pos-
sible statutory basis for FBI intelligence investigation of
foreign intelligence activities within the United States or to
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 14

collect positive foreign intelligence. The best example is
the Attorney General's authorization of warrantless FBI elec-
:
tronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes.
:
However,
there is apparently no instruction from the Justice Department
to the FBI directing the Bureau to initiate investigations of
individuals or organizations which have a marked potential for
use by a foreign intelligence service, but about which there is.
no information indicating intelligence 'activity. (See Staff
Report, \"Counterintelligence/Counterespionage: The Law and
the Philosophy\", October 14, 1975.)
:
:
In his testimony before the Committee, Deputy Associate
FBI Director James Adams made no reference to clauses (2) and
(3) as a possible legal basis for FBI intelligence investiga-
tions going beyond the investigation of specific federal crimes.
Instead, he placed sole reliance on a series of Presidential
directives extending from 1936 until the 1960's which the FBI
interprets as authorizing it to engage in \"domestic security
intelligence investigations\". The Attorney General has codified
these directives in a Justice Department regulation instructing
the FBI to:

Carry out the Presidential directive
of September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presi-
dential directives of January 8, 1943, July
24, 1950, and December 15, 1953, designating
the [FBI) to take charge of investigative
work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,
subversive activities, and related matters.
28 C.F.R., Section 0.85(d).
NW.88614 Docld:32989602 Page 15
:

:
::
:
The FBI also cites directives of President Kennedy on June 9,
1962, and Attorney General Kennedy on March 5, 1964, which
are the latest charter for the Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference, composed of the FBI Director and the chiefs of the
military intelligence agencies. This group is authorized to
coordinate \"all investigation of domestic espionage, counter-
espionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related intelligence
matters affecting internal security.\" (Tab D)

The theory behind the FBI's position is that the Presi-
dent has inherent constitutional powers, at least in the
absence of contrary legislation, to authorize FBI intelligence
activities. The only judicial support for this theory is
language in the Supreme Court's opinion in the Keith case,
which declared warrantless wiretapping of domestic groups un-
:
constitutional.
The Court acknowledged the importance of \"national secu-
rity in its domestic implications especially at a time
of worldwide ferment and when civil disorders in this country
are more prevalent than in the less turbulent periods of our
history.\" Under such circumstances, the Court stated, the
President has a \"fundamental duty\" under the Constitution to
\"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States.\" The Court added, \"Implicit in that duty is the power
to protect our Government against those who would subvert or
overthrow it by unlawful means.\" Hence, the Court appeared to
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 16
:
:

I
-6
:
recognize that the President's \"domestic security role\" has a
\"constitutional basis\"; that the President through the Attorney
General may need \"to obtain intelligence information about those
who plot unlawful acts against the Government\"; and that \"threats
and acts of sabotage against the Government exist in sufficient
number to justify investigative powers with respect to them.\"
The Court applied the general principle, that \"unless the Govern-
ment safeguards its own capacity to function and to preserve
:
the security of its people, society itself could become so dis-.
ordered that all rights and liberties would be endangered.\"
Nevertheless, the central holding of the Keith decision was that
this power may not be exercised in such a way as to infringe
constitutional rights. 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

Even though the President may have the authority under
the Constitution to direct the FBI to conduct intelligence
investigations in the absence of legislation, Congress has the
ultimate authority to substitute statutory authorization in
place of the Presidential directives. As Justice Robert Jackson
declared in the Steel Seizure Case, \"When the President takes
measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.

B. Option One Ratifying Existing Powers

The first option for Congress is legislation ratifying
the existing. authority granted to the FBI by current Presiden-
tial directives and orders. Such legislation would be cast in
extremely general terms. Its main advantage is that it would
provide a basis for Congressional oversight. It could also
reinforce the Attorney General's role as the immediate super-.
visor of FBI intelligence activities. The statute would
authorize the Attorney General to direct the FBI:

1. to conduct investigations of domestic espionage,
counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive activities;

2. to gather and report information on civil distur-
bances;
..
3. to conduct investigations of other related intelli-
gence matters affecting internal security; and :

4. to conduct investigations of official matters relat-
ing to the Department of State.

In addition, the statute would require the Attorney General
to report annually to the appropriate Congressional committees
on the volume and type of investigations and reports, the
investigative techniques used, and the policies and procedures
adopted by the Justice Department and the FBI.

The weaknesses of this approach are obvious. Congress.
would have legislated a wholesale delegation of power without
:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 18

8
-

standards or limitations other than the supervision of the
Attorney General and oversight by Congress. In view of the
Select Committee's findings as to the vast overbreadth of FBI
domestic intelligence investigations and the abuses committed
in the name of \"counterintelligence\", Congress would in effect
be permitting future expansion of FBI operations to match past
policies.

c. Option Two A Separate Security Intelligence Agency

Congress might give serious consideration to legislation
creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency within the
Justice Department. It would perform the functions of the
present Counterintelligence Branch of the FBI Intelligence
Division; dealing with foreign intelligence and counterintelli-
*gence/counterespionage. The FBI itself has considered this
option as part of the larger question of separating all FBI
intelligence functions from the law enforcement functions of
the Bureau. (Tab E)

A separate agency would be justified only if it was
authorized to conduct investigations of a wider scope and using
different techniques than would otherwise be permitted. In
other words, Congress could decide that foreign counterintelli-
gence investigations should go beyond investigation of specific
crimes, that techniques such as electronic surveillance should
be used without a warrant or with a special type of warrant,
し
:
竹
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 19

9
:
and that operations should be conducted to \"counter\" foreign
intelligence activities by means other than arrest or \"persona
non grata\" proceedings. On the other hand, if Congress treats
the investigation of foreign intelligence activities the same
as a criminal investigation, then the FBI should keep the job.

Any statute in this area must use general language for
diplomatic reasons. For example, Congress should not explicitly
authorize deception operations or efforts to compromise hostile
intelligence officers, even though such techniques may be
envisioned. Such techniques are dealt with best by establish-
ing adequate procedures for authorization and oversight to
ensure accountability.
:
The legislation should be more specific where it deals
with investigations and other operations directed at American
citizens rather than non-resident aliens in the service of a
foreign power.. If Congress believes Americans should be inves-
tigated if they have a marked potential for use by a foreign
intelligence service, but no information indicating intelligence
activity yet exists, the legislation should say so.

The statute should also set out standards for determin-
ing whether a foreign-dominated domestic organization falls
within the jurisdiction of the separate agency. There should
at the very least be substantial information indicating that
the organization is directed by, subsidized by, or in active
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 20.

-
10
:
(The
collaboration with a foreign government or organization.
term \"foreign organization\" refers, for instance, to a group
like the Palestine Liberation Organization.) If the group fits
the criteria for foreign domination, there should be an addi-
tional finding that it may engage in intelligence activities or
in activities involving the use of violence in violations of
federal law.

If the group meets all these standards, Congress may
authorize the investigation of its activities going beyond
regular criminal investigations. Such investigations could
extend to all individuals who are members of, or express sup-
port for, the organization, as well as to the efforts of the
organization to influence and control other groups. However,
it may be sufficient to authorize only the investigation. of
active members and supporters. This would prevent a revival
of the \"Cominfil\" policy of looking into all forms of lawful
political and social activity where Communists might be involv-
ed.

The Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO considered
the need for special supervision of foreign counterintelligence
operations in the United States. It recommended the creation
of a Foreign Intelligence Advisory Commission to make decisions
with regard to the necessity or acceptability of particular
foreign counterintelligence techniques. (Tab F) This proposal
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 21.

11
-
.:
has merit in view of the limited amount of time the Attorney
General can give to personal supervision and the after-the-fact
role of legislative oversight regarding the separate agency.

Finally, legislation to create a separate foreign
counterintelligence agency must deal with relationships to the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, and other
foreign intelligence agencies. The current FBI-CIA agreement
on their respective jurisdictions is only a \"memorandum of under-
standing\". It allows the CIA to undertake certain clandestine
activities within the United States, in coordination with the
FBI. (Tab G) Proposals are currently circulating in the Execu-
tive Branch for a new National Security Council Intelligence
Directive to clarify this matter, as well as to regulate CIA
electronic surveillance of American citizens abroad. (Tab H)

A full draft of a statutory charter for a separate
foreign counterintelligence agency is not included here, since
the focus is on domestic intelligence issues.. However, one
implication of such a statute would be that the remaining FBI
functions should relate only to law enforcement and criminal
investigations.

D. Option Three Elimination of FBI Domestic Intelligence

The basic assumption behind Attorney General Levi's
effort to develop \"guidelines\" for FBI domestic intelligence
is that regular criminal investigations are not adequate to
:
NW 88614 DocId:32989602 Page 22
:

12
1
..
supply the information needed to anticipate or prevent the use
of violence in violations of federal. law. That assumption
should be questioned. Regular criminal investigations are
likely to produce a substantial amount of information which
can be used to anticipate or prevent future crimes. For example,
intensive criminal investigations of Ku Klux Klan violence in
the South during the 1960's would have required the FBI to look
into a wide variety of Klan activities. Another example is the
search for Weatherman fugitives, a regular criminal investiga-
tion which involves broad inquiries across the country. The
FBI has not yet demonstrated that the preventive information
it has obtained came from intelligence investigations which
would not have been conducted as regular criminal investigations.
.:
The fact that an FBI investigation was supervised by
its Intelligence Division does not necessarily mean that the
investigation was, automatically, outside the regular criminal
law enforcement jurisdiction of the Bureau. Any FBI investiga-
tion of activities involving the use of violence in violations
of federal law falls within that jurisdiction. Moreover,
regular criminal investigations can also extend to plans,
attempts, or conspiracies to

Director Sec'y

On 12/4/75, a meeting was held with the following
representatives of captioned Committee: Chief Counsel F.A.O.
Schwartz; Assistant Counsel Paul Michel; Staff Member Mark
Gitenstein; Staff Director of the Domestic Task Force John T.
Elliff; and Staff Member John Bayley. Representing the Bureau
at this meeting were Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams,
Assistant Director John A. Mintz, Inspector John B. Hotis, and
SA Paul V. Daly.

The meeting discussed the forthcoming testimony on
12/9/75 of the Director before that Committee and Elliff fur-1
nished the Bureau two draft papers discussing the Bureau's
investigative jurisdiction and issues the Committee Staff feels
the Senate Select Committee must address from a legislative
standpoint. Copies of these papers are attached.

The first paper which consists of six pages discusses
in Part 1 what the Committee sees as problems arising out of
the FBI's domestic intelligence investigations. This portion
highlights the fact that these investigations may be overbroad
in scope, collect irrelevant information, and continue the in-
vestigations beyond what the Committee sees as their normal
investigative conclusion. This portion also addresses the
investigative techniques used during these investigations and
the resultant dissemination of information collected.

Under Part 2, the document discusses options available
to the Committee. These options run the gamut from abolition
of the Bureau's domestic intelligence functions to administrative
oversight by the Attorney General or Congressional oversight or
enacting legislation providing for domestic intelligence investi-
gations with legislative limits imposed on such investigations.
Included is the consideration of creating an independent
Inspector General.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

The second position paper which was prepared by
John T. Elliff begins by a six-page statement and analysis
of the Bureau's current authority to conduct domestic in-
telligence investigations. He then lists four options for
the Committee.

Option 1 is for Congress to pass legislation ratifying
the existing FBI authority as set forth by Presidential directives
and Executive Orders.

Option 2 suggests Congress might give serious con-
sideration to creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency
within the Department of Justice. In this Option, Elliff sug-
gests that the FBI itself has considered this Option as part of
the larger question of separating all FBI intelligence functions
from law enforcement functions of the Bureau.

Option 3 considers the elimination of FBI domestic
intelligence. In his analysis of this position, it might be
possible for the Bureau to develop the necessary intelligence
information through its normal criminal investigations and
thus remove the necessity for domestic intelligence investi-
gations as presently conducted.

Option 4 considers setting standards for domestic
intelligence investigations. In this Option, Elliff states
that the FBI should be authorized by statute to conduct domestic
intelligence investigations only as Congress finds that regular
criminal investigations would not provide information to an-
ticipate or prevent the use of violence in violations of Federal
law and that incidents of the use of violence in such violations
are of a serious nature and threaten the security of the country.

For purposes of the Director's appearance on 12/9/75
before the Senate Select Committee, it is believed his response
to questions concerning the aforementioned position papers should
be that the Bureau has received copies and is reviewing the various
proposals and that it would not be appropriate at this time for
the Director to comment regarding the substance of the proposals.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Elliff indicated during this meeting that the Director
during his appearance may anticipate being asked a question by
one of the Senators relating to his statement before the American
Bar Association in Montreal concerning the necessity for the
sacrifice of certain individual rights at the expense of investi-
gations. He also anticipated the Director might be asked a
question concerning his position on COINTELPRO. Regarding
the question concerning the Director's statement before the
American Bar Association in Montreal, the Legal Counsel Divi-
sion will draft a proposed resonse. Concerning COINTELPRO, a
response has been prepared and will be put together with the
briefing material for the Director.

This memorandum in general highlights the Options
presented in the attached papers. A more detailed analysis
should be prepared by the Intelligence Division and existing
documents addressing these proposals should be made available
for the Director's briefing book for his testimony.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Director respond to questions concerning
the attached position papers as set forth above.
Done.

(2) That the Legal Counsel Division draft a proposed
response concerning the Director's statement made in Montreal
relating to the sacrifice of certain individual rights.
Done.

(3) That the Intelligence Division make a detailed
review of the various Options set forth in the two attached
position papers. (FOR SUBSEQUENT STAFF CONFEE CA

I. Background

MDR-16
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 10/31/00 BY SPALMKP

In the past few weeks the staff has presented the Committee
with evidence suggesting the following about the FBI's
internal security intelligence program:

A. The program is massive, involving the collection of
information on the activities of thousands of innocent,
law-abiding American citizens.

B. These individuals were not alleged espionage agents, but
citizens who fall within the FBI's vague definitions of
\"subversion\" and \"extremism\" purely homegrown \"threats
to the national security\".

C. That FBI policy on \"subversive\" and \"extremist\" inves-
tigations was vague and subject to the following abuses:

1. overbreadth in scope in that groups were investigated
whose threats to the national security were tenuous,
if not non-existent.

2. collection of information on the personal life and
political views of subjects unrelated to the national
security.

3. the continuance of investigations well after it
should have become obvious that there was no legiti-
mate predicate.

D. Particularly invasive collection techniques were used,
including electronic surveillance, mail opening, and sur-
reptitious entries. Although these have been terminated,
the predominant and perhaps most insidious continues
today through the FBI's huge informant/confidential source
network.

E. Information collected in the course of these investiga-
tions is disseminated regularly throughout the federal
government and to local law enforcement.

F. Until 1971, information collected through these investi-
gations was disseminated as part of the COINTELPRO pro-
gram to the subjects' friends, relatives, employers, and
others in an effort to discredit or \"neutralize\" alleged
\"subversives\" or \"extremists\". 62-1116 393 12154

G. The FBI's internal security intelligence program was
used by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard
Nixon to serve their political interests, usually by
collecting information on critics or political
opponents.

H. The program was conceived and implemented in secrecy,
and although parts of the program were shared with out-
side authorities from time to time, until now no
President, Attorney General, or Congressional committee
has been exposed to the entire program in detail.

I. The program is not authorized by statute but is founded
on a series of secret or ambiguous Presidential orders,
which in turn are based upon a questionable assertion
of \"inherent constitutional authority\".

J. The program continues today, albeit on a much more
limited basis than in the late 1960's and early 1970's,
and the basic machinery for the program the huge
informant/confidential source network is still
operating...

K. There is no statute or internal Bureau or Justice Depart-
'ment policy prohibiting a new Director, Attorney General,
or President from ordering the Bureau to expand the pro-
gram to its earlier dimensions.

II. Issues and Options

Among the issues and options which might be discussed with
former Attorneys General in response to what the Committee
has learned are the following:

A. Abolition. Elimination of the FBI internal security
intelligence program as Attorney General Harlan Stone
ordered in 1924 when confronted with abuses growing out
of the FBI's first internal security intelligence pro-
gram, such as the infamous Palmer raids.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether there are not some functions (e.g., protecting
the President, preventing or at least predicting
violence by terrorist organizations, or predicting
civil disorders) which require intelligence collec-
tion.

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 6

- 3 -

2. Whether FBI intelligence reports are valuable in
that respect, especially in light of a recent GAO
report suggesting that such reports are rarely use-
ful in predicting violent activity.

3. Whether such information, assuming it is valuable,
could not be obtained through more traditional criminal
investigations.

4. Whether the value of the information, marginal or
otherwise, justifies the risk to civil liberties
inherent in such intelligence collection.

5. Whether, given the way in which limited and ambiguous
grants of authority have been expanded into major
authorizations,any statute short of a total prohibi-
tion of all non-law enforcement intelligence activi
ties in the domestic sector will be adequate to pre-
vent the recurrences of the kinds of abuses uncovered
by this Committee. (Or, conversely, whether it is
possible to draft a law authorizing a limited civil
disturbance and counter-terrorist intelligence mission
that will not eventually evolve, like the National
Security Act of 1947, into a charter for unanticipated
and unwanted covert activities.)

6. Whether it would be sufficient to restrict the FBI
to criminal investigations without also (a) placing
limits upon the length of investigations, (b) the
kinäs of information which can be collected and dis-
seminated on the subject irrelevant to the alleged
criminal act, (c). the utilization of warrantless
electronic surveillance and other particularly inva-
sive collection techniques, and (d) the utilization
of a huge informant/confidential source network with-
out judicial or Justice Department supervision.

B. Authorizing Statute. Recognition of the value of
internal security intelligence, but placing limits upon
the program designed to minimize the infringement upon
civil liberties, an option being actively considered by
the present Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out under the first option and,
in addition:

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 7

C. - 4 -

1. Whether meaningful and stringent guidelines can be
written which do not so hamper the administration
of an internal security intelligence program as to
make the product not just marginal, as GAO suggests,
but worthless.*

2. In light of the possibility that the present Attorney
General may address this matter via internal Justice
Department guidelines, whether this approach does
not ignore the legal authority question which can
only be resolved by statute.

3. Whether or not Congress could draft a statutory ver-
sion of the guidelines which could be flexible enough
to meet an evolving threat and at the same time
place meaningful restrictions upon the program.

4. Even assuming there is no absence of legal authority,
is it safe to leave these guidelines in the form of a
departmental order which can be rescinded by the next
Attorney General?

Delegation of Authority to Attorney General. Simply
ratifying the present program via enactment of a statutory
charter which grants the FBI authority to conduct an
internal security intelligence program subject to its own
internal guidelines or departmental guidelines as proposed
by the Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and:

1. Whether such a statute would not be an unconstitu-
tional delegation of powers to the Executive Branch.

2. Whether enactment of such a statute 'would not repre-
sent a failure by the Congress to confront the issues
raised above.

*A preliminary staff analysis of the Attorney General's draft
guidelines suggests that, despite months of conscientious and
painstaking work by a departmental task force, the guidelines
are not adequate. This analysis, which will be presented when
Attorney General Levi testifies on December 10, indicates that
several of the more questionable FBI investigations (e.g., of
Dr. King and the women's liberation movement) would still be
permissible under these proposed guidelines.

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 8

D. - 5 -

Legislative Inaction. Enact no new statute affecting
the FBI's legal authority or the internal security intel-
ligence program.
:
In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and, in addition:

1. Whether this failure to act might not leave the
status of the program in doubt and subject to court
challenge.

2. :
Whether this failure to act after full disclosure
by the Bureau might not be taken by the FBI and the
courts as a ratification of the program.

E. Administrative Oversight by the Attorney General. The
Justice Department should be required to exercise greater
administrative oversight over the FBI's internal security
intelligence program by Attorney General Levi, regardless
of whatever other options Congress accepts.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is practical for the Attorney General or
his staff to review thousands of such investigations
each year.

2. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should
review all or just the so-called \"full\" investiga-
tions.

3. Whether, to facilitate the conduct of such reviews,
the Attorney General or his staff should be given
\"complete\" access to Bureau files, including informa-
tion regarding the identity and reliability of infor-
mants and confidential sources.

4. Whether it is possible to develop a staff of career
attorneys within the Department with both the access.
and independence essential to the conduct of search-
ing reviews.

5. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should not
also be required to review various informant and so-
called \"intensification\" programs, and the establish-
ment of specialized indices (which have a significant
impact upon which cases are opened) instead of just
reviewing individual investigations in a vacuum as
provided by the Attorney General's draft guidelines.

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 9

F. - 6 -
An. Inspector General. In addition to the above options,
an independent Inspector General should be created to
investigate improprieties by the FBI. This option is
advanced by those concerned about the inadequacy of the
FBI's investigation of the disappearance of former
Director Hoover's personal files, its limited inquiry
into the so-called Atlantic City convention case, and
the absence of any internal investigation of the abuses
in the King case.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to maintain the independence
of an Inspector General within the Department of
Justice when both the Inspector General and the
Director of the FBI will be responsible to the same
official, the Attorney General.

2. Whether the Inspector General should have \"complete\"
access to Bureau files, including information per-
taining to the identity and reliability of informants
and confidential sources.

3. Whether an Inspector General with access to extremely
sensitive information might not become a serious
threat to the independence of the Bureau from politi-
cal influence and to the civil liberties of American
citizens.
:
G. Congressional Oversight. In addition to the above
options, the creation of an oversight committee(s) in the
Congress, to which the Bureau would be required to report
and which would have the power to investigate abuses.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the kinds of problems posed by the Justice Department
oversight and Inspector General options discussed above
to the independence of the FBI and the confidentiality
of its files.

H. Public Reporting and Disclosure to Subjects. In addition
to the above options, the requirement that the FBI make
frequent public reports on the details of its internal
security intelligence programs and policies and reveal
the details of improper intelligence investigations to
the subjects of those investigations.

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 10

- 7 -

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to reveal the essence of some
programs and policies and the details of some inves-
tigations without jeopardizing the effectiveness of
legitimate programs.

2. Whether such disclosure might not increase the num-
ber of law suits filed against the FBI alleging
illegal activities.

DRAFT
MEMORANDUM

FBI LEGISLATION PROPOSED OPTIONS
December 4, 1975.

In preparation for the testimony of FBI Director
Kelley and Attorney General Levi on December 9 and 10, the
Domestic Intelligence Task Force is pulling together various
proposals for legislation dealing with FBI intelligence.
This paper sets forth some of the basic options.

A: Current Statutes and Executive Orders

The basic statute governing the FBI is 18 U.S.C. 533,
which reads as follows:

The Attorney General may appoint officials:
(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against
the United States, (2) to assist in the
protection of the person of the President,
and (3) to conduct such other investigations
regarding official matters under the control
of the Department of Justice and the Depart-
ment of State as may be directed by the
Attorney General.

Clauses (2) and (3) are a possible statutory basis
for intelligence investigations going beyond the investigation
of specific federal crimes. Under (2), the FBI may \"assist\" the
Secret Service in the protection of the President by providing

intelligence on persons or groups who may endanger the Presi-
dent's safety. A formal agreement between the FBI and the
Secret Service sets forth the types of intelligence information
provided by the Bureau. However, this agreement states that:
:
-:
:
The FBI will not conduct investigation
of individuals or groups solely for the pur-
pose of establishing whether they constitute
a threat to the safety of the President and
certain other persons unless there is an
indication of a violation of Title 18, U. S.
Code, Section 1751, or other statute over
which the FBI has jurisdiction. (Tab A)
こ
Clause (3) recognizes that the Attorney General may
direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of Justice.\" This is a
possible statutory basis for at least two broad areas of FBI
intelligence investigations civil disturbance intelligence
and intelligence for the Federal Employee Security. Program.

The most recent legal advice to the FBI from the Justice
Department on the gathering and reporting of data regarding
civil disturbances notes that on April 1, 1969, the President
designated the Attorney General as chief civilian officer to
coordinate the government's response to civil disturbances.
The FBI is instructed to gather and report on \"all significant
incidents of civil unrest\" and on \"all disturbances where there
. are believed
are indications that extremist organizations
to be involved in efforts to instigate or exploit them.\" The
:

FBI is spécifically advised to make reports \"even when no
specific violation of federal law is indicated.\" On the other
:
:
hand, the FBI is instructed not to report \"every relatively in-
significant incident of a strictly local nature coming to its
attention.\"
:
(Tab B)

The Justice Department has given the following recent
instructions to the FBI regarding intelligence for the Federal
Employee Security Program. Executive Order 10450, as amended
by Executive Order 11785, is interpreted as requiring an FBI
:
:
:
investigation of organizations \"with a potential\" of violating
federal or state statutes prohibiting unlawful advocacy of vio-
lence or the commission of any unlawful act of violence. The
FBI is advised that \"it is not possible to set definite para-
meters covering the initiation of investigations of potential
organizations falling within the Order.\" The FBI is instructed
to apply \"the same yardstick\" to investigations of individuals
who are affiliated with such organizations. The FBI is specifi-
cally advised that \"it is not necessary that a crime occur
before the investigation is initiated.\" (Tab C)
:
Clause (3) also recognizes that the Attorney General
may direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of State.\" This is a pos-
sible statutory basis for FBI intelligence investigation of
foreign intelligence activities within the United States or to

collect positive foreign intelligence. The best example is
the Attorney General's authorization of warrantless FBI elec-
:
tronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes.
:
However,
there is apparently no instruction from the Justice Department
to the FBI directing the Bureau to initiate investigations of
individuals or organizations which have a marked potential for
use by a foreign intelligence service, but about which there is.
no information indicating intelligence 'activity. (See Staff
Report, \"Counterintelligence/Counterespionage: The Law and
the Philosophy\", October 14, 1975.)
:
:
In his testimony before the Committee, Deputy Associate
FBI Director James Adams made no reference to clauses (2) and
(3) as a possible legal basis for FBI intelligence investiga-
tions going beyond the investigation of specific federal crimes.
Instead, he placed sole reliance on a series of Presidential
directives extending from 1936 until the 1960's which the FBI
interprets as authorizing it to engage in \"domestic security
intelligence investigations\". The Attorney General has codified
these directives in a Justice Department regulation instructing
the FBI to:

Carry out the Presidential directive
of September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presi-
dential directives of January 8, 1943, July
24, 1950, and December 15, 1953, designating
the [FBI) to take charge of investigative
work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,
subversive activities, and related matters.
28 C.F.R., Section 0.85(d).

NW.88614 Docld:32989602 Page 15

:
::
:
The FBI also cites directives of President Kennedy on June 9,
1962, and Attorney General Kennedy on March 5, 1964, which
are the latest charter for the Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference, composed of the FBI Director and the chiefs of the
military intelligence agencies. This group is authorized to
coordinate \"all investigation of domestic espionage, counter-
espionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related intelligence
matters affecting internal security.\" (Tab D)

The theory behind the FBI's position is that the Presi-
dent has inherent constitutional powers, at least in the
absence of contrary legislation, to authorize FBI intelligence
activities. The only judicial support for this theory is
language in the Supreme Court's opinion in the Keith case,
which declared warrantless wiretapping of domestic groups un-
:
constitutional.

The Court acknowledged the importance of \"national secu-
rity in its domestic implications especially at a time
of worldwide ferment and when civil disorders in this country
are more prevalent than in the less turbulent periods of our
history.\" Under such circumstances, the Court stated, the
President has a \"fundamental duty\" under the Constitution to
\"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States.\" The Court added, \"Implicit in that duty is the power
to protect our Government against those who would subvert or
overthrow it by unlawful means.\" Hence, the Court appeared to
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 16
:
:

I -6
:
recognize that the President's \"domestic security role\" has a
\"constitutional basis\"; that the President through the Attorney
General may need \"to obtain intelligence information about those
who plot unlawful acts against the Government\"; and that \"threats
and acts of sabotage against the Government exist in sufficient
number to justify investigative powers with respect to them.\"
The Court applied the general principle, that \"unless the Govern-
ment safeguards its own capacity to function and to preserve
:
the security of its people, society itself could become so dis-.
ordered that all rights and liberties would be endangered.\"
Nevertheless, the central holding of the Keith decision was that
this power may not be exercised in such a way as to infringe
constitutional rights. 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

Even though the President may have the authority under
the Constitution to direct the FBI to conduct intelligence
investigations in the absence of legislation, Congress has the
ultimate authority to substitute statutory authorization in
place of the Presidential directives. As Justice Robert Jackson
declared in the Steel Seizure Case, \"When the President takes
measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.

B. Option One Ratifying Existing Powers

The first option for Congress is legislation ratifying
the existing. authority granted to the FBI by current Presiden-
tial directives and orders. Such legislation would be cast in
extremely general terms. Its main advantage is that it would
provide a basis for Congressional oversight. It could also
reinforce the Attorney General's role as the immediate super-.
visor of FBI intelligence activities. The statute would
authorize the Attorney General to direct the FBI:

1. to conduct investigations of domestic espionage,
counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive activities;

2. to gather and report information on civil distur-
bances;

3. to conduct investigations of other related intelli-
gence matters affecting internal security; and :

4. to conduct investigations of official matters relat-
ing to the Department of State.

In addition, the statute would require the Attorney General
to report annually to the appropriate Congressional committees
on the volume and type of investigations and reports, the
investigative techniques used, and the policies and procedures
adopted by the Justice Department and the FBI.

The weaknesses of this approach are obvious. Congress.
would have legislated a wholesale delegation of power without
:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 18

- 8 -

standards or limitations other than the supervision of the
Attorney General and oversight by Congress. In view of the
Select Committee's findings as to the vast overbreadth of FBI
domestic intelligence investigations and the abuses committed
in the name of \"counterintelligence\", Congress would in effect
be permitting future expansion of FBI operations to match past
policies.

C. Option Two A Separate Security Intelligence Agency
Congress might give serious consideration to legislation
creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency within the
Justice Department. It would perform the functions of the
present Counterintelligence Branch of the FBI Intelligence
Division; dealing with foreign intelligence and counterintelli-
*gence/counterespionage. The FBI itself has considered this
option as part of the larger question of separating all FBI
intelligence functions from the law enforcement functions of
the Bureau. (Tab E)

A separate agency would be justified only if it was
authorized to conduct investigations of a wider scope and using
different techniques than would otherwise be permitted. In
other words, Congress could decide that foreign counterintelli-
gence investigations should go beyond investigation of specific
crimes, that techniques such as electronic surveillance should
be used without a warrant or with a special type of warrant,
し
:
竹
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 19

9

and that operations should be conducted to \"counter\" foreign
intelligence activities by means other than arrest or \"persona
non grata\" proceedings. On the other hand, if Congress treats
the investigation of foreign intelligence activities the same
as a criminal investigation, then the FBI should keep the job.

Any statute in this area must use general language for
diplomatic reasons. For example, Congress should not explicitly
authorize deception operations or efforts to compromise hostile
intelligence officers, even though such techniques may be
envisioned. Such techniques are dealt with best by establish-
ing adequate procedures for authorization and oversight to
ensure accountability.
:
The legislation should be more specific where it deals
with investigations and other operations directed at American
citizens rather than non-resident aliens in the service of a
foreign power.. If Congress believes Americans should be inves-
tigated if they have a marked potential for use by a foreign
intelligence service, but no information indicating intelligence
activity yet exists, the legislation should say so.

The statute should also set out standards for determin-
ing whether a foreign-dominated domestic organization falls
within the jurisdiction of the separate agency. There should
at the very least be substantial information indicating that
the organization is directed by, subsidized by, or in active
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 20.

- 10 -
:
(The
collaboration with a foreign government or organization.
term \"foreign organization\" refers, for instance, to a group
like the Palestine Liberation Organization.) If the group fits
the criteria for foreign domination, there should be an addi-
tional finding that it may engage in intelligence activities or
in activities involving the use of violence in violations of
federal law.

If the group meets all these standards, Congress may
authorize the investigation of its activities going beyond
regular criminal investigations. Such investigations could
extend to all individuals who are members of, or express sup-
port for, the organization, as well as to the efforts of the
organization to influence and control other groups. However,
it may be sufficient to authorize only the investigation. of
active members and supporters. This would prevent a revival
of the \"Cominfil\" policy of looking into all forms of lawful
political and social activity where Communists might be involv-
ed.

The Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO considered
the need for special supervision of foreign counterintelligence
operations in the United States. It recommended the creation
of a Foreign Intelligence Advisory Commission to make decisions
with regard to the necessity or acceptability of particular
foreign counterintelligence techniques. (Tab F) This proposal
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 21.

- 11 -
.:
has merit in view of the limited amount of time the Attorney
General can give to personal supervision and the after-the-fact
role of legislative oversight regarding the separate agency.

Finally, legislation to create a separate foreign
counterintelligence agency must deal with relationships to the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, and other
foreign intelligence agencies. The current FBI-CIA agreement
on their respective jurisdictions is only a \"memorandum of under-
standing\". It allows the CIA to undertake certain clandestine
activities within the United States, in coordination with the
FBI. (Tab G) Proposals are currently circulating in the Execu-
tive Branch for a new National Security Council Intelligence
Directive to clarify this matter, as well as to regulate CIA
electronic surveillance of American citizens abroad. (Tab H)

A full draft of a statutory charter for a separate
foreign counterintelligence agency is not included here, since
the focus is on domestic intelligence issues.. However, one
implication of such a statute would be that the remaining FBI
functions should relate only to law enforcement and criminal
investigations.

D. Option Three Elimination of FBI Domestic Intelligence

The basic assumption behind Attorney General Levi's
effort to develop \"guidelines\" for FBI domestic intelligence
is that regular criminal investigations are not adequate to
:
NW 88614 DocId:32989602 Page 22
:

12
1
..
supply the information needed to anticipate or prevent the use
of violence in violations of federal. law. That assumption
should be questioned. Regular criminal investigations are
likely to produce a substantial amount of information which
can be used to anticipate or prevent future crimes. For example,
intensive criminal investigations of Ku Klux Klan violence in
the South during the 1960's would have required the FBI to look
into a wide variety of Klan activities. Another example is the
search for Weatherman fugitives, a regular criminal investiga-
tion which involves broad inquiries across the country. The
FBI has not yet demonstrated that the preventive information
it has obtained came from intelligence investigations which
would not have been conducted as regular criminal investigations.
.:
The fact that an FBI investigation was supervised by
its Intelligence Division does not necessarily mean that the
investigation was, automatically, outside the regular criminal
law enforcement jurisdiction of the Bureau. Any FBI investiga-
tion of activities involving the use of violence in violations
of federal law falls within that jurisdiction. Moreover,
regular criminal investigations can also extend to plans,
attempts, or conspiracies to engage in such activities.

Director Sec'y

On 12/4/75, a meeting was held with the following
representatives of captioned Committee: Chief Counsel F.A.O.
Schwartz; Assistant Counsel Paul Michel; Staff Member Mark
Gitenstein; Staff Director of the Domestic Task Force John T.
Elliff; and Staff Member John Bayley. Representing the Bureau
at this meeting were Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams,
Assistant Director John A. Mintz, Inspector John B. Hotis, and
SA Paul V. Daly.

The meeting discussed the forthcoming testimony on
12/9/75 of the Director before that Committee and Elliff fur-1
nished the Bureau two draft papers discussing the Bureau's
investigative jurisdiction and issues the Committee Staff feels
the Senate Select Committee must address from a legislative
standpoint. Copies of these papers are attached.

The first paper which consists of six pages discusses
in Part 1 what the Committee sees as problems arising out of
the FBI's domestic intelligence investigations. This portion
highlights the fact that these investigations may be overbroad
in scope, collect irrelevant information, and continue the in-
vestigations beyond what the Committee sees as their normal
investigative conclusion. This portion also addresses the
investigative techniques used during these investigations and
the resultant dissemination of information collected.

Under Part 2, the document discusses options available
to the Committee. These options run the gamut from abolition
of the Bureau's domestic intelligence functions to administrative
oversight by the Attorney General or Congressional oversight or
enacting legislation providing for domestic intelligence investi-
gations with legislative limits imposed on such investigations.
Included is the consideration of creating an independent
Inspector General.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

The second position paper which was prepared by
John T. Elliff begins by a six-page statement and analysis
of the Bureau's current authority to conduct domestic in-
telligence investigations. He then lists four options for
the Committee.

Option 1 is for Congress to pass legislation ratifying
the existing FBI authority as set forth by Presidential directives
and Executive Orders.

Option 2 suggests Congress might give serious con-
sideration to creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency
within the Department of Justice. In this Option, Elliff sug-
gests that the FBI itself has considered this Option as part of
the larger question of separating all FBI intelligence functions
from law enforcement functions of the Bureau.

Option 3 considers the elimination of FBI domestic
intelligence. In his analysis of this position, it might be
possible for the Bureau to develop the necessary intelligence
information through its normal criminal investigations and
thus remove the necessity for domestic intelligence investi-
gations as presently conducted.

Option 4 considers setting standards for domestic
intelligence investigations. In this Option, Elliff states
that the FBI should be authorized by statute to conduct domestic
intelligence investigations only as Congress finds that regular
criminal investigations would not provide information to an-
ticipate or prevent the use of violence in violations of Federal
law and that incidents of the use of violence in such violations
are of a serious nature and threaten the security of the country.

For purposes of the Director's appearance on 12/9/75
before the Senate Select Committee, it is believed his response
to questions concerning the aforementioned position papers should
be that the Bureau has received copies and is reviewing the various
proposals and that it would not be appropriate at this time for
the Director to comment regarding the substance of the proposals.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Elliff indicated during this meeting that the Director
during his appearance may anticipate being asked a question by
one of the Senators relating to his statement before the American
Bar Association in Montreal concerning the necessity for the
sacrifice of certain individual rights at the expense of investi-
gations. He also anticipated the Director might be asked a
question concerning his position on COINTELPRO. Regarding
the question concerning the Director's statement before the
American Bar Association in Montreal, the Legal Counsel Divi-
sion will draft a proposed resonse. Concerning COINTELPRO, a
response has been prepared and will be put together with the
briefing material for the Director.

This memorandum in general highlights the Options
presented in the attached papers. A more detailed analysis
should be prepared by the Intelligence Division and existing
documents addressing these proposals should be made available
for the Director's briefing book for his testimony.

Issues and Options for Discussion with
Former Attorneys General Rogers, Katzenbach, and Clark

I. Background MDR-16
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 10/31/00 BY SP2ALMKP

In the past few weeks the staff has presented the Committee
with evidence suggesting the following about the FBI's
internal security intelligence program:

A. The program is massive, involving the collection of
information on the activities of thousands of innocent,
law-abiding American citizens.

B. These individuals were not alleged espionage agents, but
citizens who fall within the FBI's vague definitions of
\"subversion\" and \"extremism\" purely homegrown \"threats
to the national security\".

C. That FBI policy on \"subversive\" and \"extremist\" inves-
tigations was vague and subject to the following abuses:

1. overbreadth in scope in that groups were investigated
whose threats to the national security were tenuous,
if not non-existent.

2. collection of information on the personal life and
political views of subjects unrelated to the national
security.

3. the continuance of investigations well after it
should have become obvious that there was no legiti-
mate predicate.

D. Particularly invasive collection techniques were used,
including electronic surveillance, mail opening, and sur-
reptitious entries. Although these have been terminated,
the predominant and perhaps most insidious continues
today through the FBI's huge informant/confidential source
network.

E. Information collected in the course of these investiga-
tions is disseminated regularly throughout the federal
government and to local law enforcement.

F. Until 1971, information collected through these investi-
gations was disseminated as part of the COINTELPRO pro-
gram to the subjects' friends, relatives, employers, and
others in an effort to discredit or \"neutralize\" alleged
\"subversives\" or \"extremists\". 62-1116 393

G. The FBI's internal security intelligence program was
used by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard
Nixon to serve their political interests, usually by
collecting information on critics or political
opponents.

H. The program was conceived and implemented in secrecy,
and although parts of the program were shared with out-
side authorities from time to time, until now no
President, Attorney General, or Congressional committee
has been exposed to the entire program in detail.

I The program is not authorized by statute but is founded
on a series of secret or ambiguous Presidential orders,
which in turn are based upon a questionable assertion
of \"inherent constitutional authority\".

J. The program continues today, albeit on a much more
limited basis than in the late 1960's and early 1970's,
and the basic machinery for the program the huge
informant/confidential source network is still
operating...

K. There is no statute or internal Bureau or Justice Depart-
'ment policy prohibiting a new Director, Attorney General,
or President from ordering the Bureau to expand the pro-
gram to its earlier dimensions.

II. Issues and Options

Among the issues and options which might be discussed with
former Attorneys General in response to what the Committee
has learned are the following:

A. Abolition. Elimination of the FBI internal security
intelligence program as Attorney General Harlan Stone
ordered in 1924 when confronted with abuses growing out
of the FBI's first internal security intelligence pro-
gram, such as the infamous Palmer raids.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether there are not some functions (e.g., protecting
the President, preventing or at least predicting
violence by terrorist organizations, or predicting
civil disorders) which require intelligence collec-
tion.

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 6

- 3 -

2. Whether FBI intelligence reports are valuable in
that respect, especially in light of a recent GAO
report suggesting that such reports are rarely use-
ful in predicting violent activity.

3. Whether such information, assuming it is valuable,
could not be obtained through more traditional criminal
investigations.

4. Whether the value of the information, marginal or
otherwise, justifies the risk to civil liberties
inherent in such intelligence collection.

5. Whether, given the way in which limited and ambiguous
grants of authority have been expanded into major
authorizations,any statute short of a total prohibi-
tion of all non-law enforcement intelligence activi
ties in the domestic sector will be adequate to pre-
vent the recurrences of the kinds of abuses uncovered
by this Committee. (Or, conversely, whether it is
possible to draft a law authorizing a limited civil
disturbance and counter-terrorist intelligence mission
that will not eventually evolve, like the National
Security Act of 1947, into a charter for unanticipated
and unwanted covert activities.)

6. Whether it would be sufficient to restrict the FBI
to criminal investigations without also (a) placing
limits upon the length of investigations, (b) the
kinäs of information which can be collected and dis-
seminated on the subject irrelevant to the alleged
criminal act, (c). the utilization of warrantless
electronic surveillance and other particularly inva-
sive collection techniques, and (d) the utilization
of a huge informant/confidential source network with-
out judicial or Justice Department supervision.

B. Authorizing Statute. Recognition of the value of
internal security intelligence, but placing limits upon
the program designed to minimize the infringement upon
civil liberties, an option being actively considered by
the present Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out under the first option and,
in addition:

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 7

4

1. Whether meaningful and stringent guidelines can be
written which do not so hamper the administration
of an internal security intelligence program as to
make the product not just marginal, as GAO suggests,
but worthless.*

2. In light of the possibility that the present Attorney
General may address this matter via internal Justice
Department guidelines, whether this approach does
not ignore the legal authority question which can
only be resolved by statute.

3. Whether or not Congress could draft a statutory ver-
sion of the guidelines which could be flexible enough
to meet an evolving threat and at the same time
place meaningful restrictions upon the program.

4. Even assuming there is no absence of legal authority,
is it safe to leave these guidelines in the form of a
departmental order which can be rescinded by the next
Attorney General?

C. Delegation of Authority to Attorney General. Simply
ratifying the present program via enactment of a statutory
charter which grants the FBI authority to conduct an
internal security intelligence program subject to its own
internal guidelines or departmental guidelines as proposed
by the Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and:

1. Whether such a statute would not be an unconstitu-
tional delegation of powers to the Executive Branch.

2. Whether enactment of such a statute 'would not repre-
sent a failure by the Congress to confront the issues
raised above.

*A preliminary staff analysis of the Attorney General's draft
guidelines suggests that, despite months of conscientious and
painstaking work by a departmental task force, the guidelines
are not adequate. This analysis, which will be presented when
Attorney General Levi testifies on December 10, indicates that
several of the more questionable FBI investigations (e.g., of
Dr. King and the women's liberation movement) would still be
permissible under these proposed guidelines.

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 8

5

D. Legislative Inaction. Enact no new statute affecting
the FBI's legal authority or the internal security intel-
ligence program.
:
In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and, in addition:

1. Whether this failure to act might not leave the
status of the program in doubt and subject to court
challenge.

2. Whether this failure to act after full disclosure
by the Bureau might not be taken by the FBI and the
courts as a ratification of the program.

E. Administrative Oversight by the Attorney General. The
Justice Department should be required to exercise greater
administrative oversight over the FBI's internal security
intelligence program by Attorney General Levi, regardless
of whatever other options Congress accepts.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is practical for the Attorney General or
his staff to review thousands of such investigations
each year.

2. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should
review all or just the so-called \"full\" investiga-
tions.

3. Whether, to facilitate the conduct of such reviews,
the Attorney General or his staff should be given
\"complete\" access to Bureau files, including informa-
tion regarding the identity and reliability of infor-
mants and confidential sources.

4. Whether it is possible to develop a staff of career
attorneys within the Department with both the access.
and independence essential to the conduct of search-
ing reviews.

5. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should not
also be required to review various informant and so-
called \"intensification\" programs, and the establish-
ment of specialized indices (which have a significant
impact upon which cases are opened) instead of just
reviewing individual investigations in a vacuum as
provided by the Attorney General's draft guidelines.

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 9

6

F. An. Inspector General. In addition to the above options,
an independent Inspector General should be created to
investigate improprieties by the FBI. This option is
advanced by those concerned about the inadequacy of the
FBI's investigation of the disappearance of former
Director Hoover's personal files, its limited inquiry
into the so-called Atlantic City convention case, and
the absence of any internal investigation of the abuses
in the King case.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to maintain the independence
of an Inspector General within the Department of
Justice when both the Inspector General and the
Director of the FBI will be responsible to the same
official, the Attorney General.

2. Whether the Inspector General should have \"complete\"
access to Bureau files, including information per-
taining to the identity and reliability of informants
and confidential sources.

3. Whether an Inspector General with access to extremely
sensitive information might not become a serious
threat to the independence of the Bureau from politi-
cal influence and to the civil liberties of American
citizens.

G. Congressional Oversight. In addition to the above
options, the creation of an oversight committee(s) in the
Congress, to which the Bureau would be required to report
and which would have the power to investigate abuses.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the kinds of problems posed by the Justice Department
oversight and Inspector General options discussed above
to the independence of the FBI and the confidentiality
of its files.

H. Public Reporting and Disclosure to Subjects. In addition
to the above options, the requirement that the FBI make
frequent public reports on the details of its internal
security intelligence programs and policies and reveal
the details of improper intelligence investigations to
the subjects of those investigations.

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 10

7

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to reveal the essence of some
programs and policies and the details of some inves-
tigations without jeopardizing the effectiveness of
legitimate programs.

2. Whether such disclosure might not increase the num-
ber of law suits filed against the FBI alleging
illegal activities.

DRAFT
MEMORANDUM

December 4, 1975.

FBI LEGISLATION PROPOSED OPTIONS

In preparation for the testimony of FBI Director
Kelley and Attorney General Levi on December 9 and 10, the
Domestic Intelligence Task Force is pulling together various
proposals for legislation dealing with FBI intelligence.
This paper sets forth some of the basic options.

A: Current Statutes and Executive Orders

The basic statute governing the FBI is 18 U.S.C. 533,
which reads as follows:

The Attorney General may appoint officials:
(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against
the United States, (2) to assist in the
protection of the person of the President,
and (3) to conduct such other investigations
regarding official matters under the control
of the Department of Justice and the Depart-
ment of State as may be directed by the
Attorney General.

Clauses (2) and (3) are a possible statutory basis
for intelligence investigations going beyond the investigation
of specific federal crimes. Under (2), the FBI may \"assist\" the
Secret Service in the protection of the President by providing

2-

intelligence on persons or groups who may endanger the Presi-
dent's safety. A formal agreement between the FBI and the
Secret Service sets forth the types of intelligence information
provided by the Bureau. However, this agreement states that:

The FBI will not conduct investigation
of individuals or groups solely for the pur-
pose of establishing whether they constitute
a threat to the safety of the President and
certain other persons unless there is an
indication of a violation of Title 18, U. S.
Code, Section 1751, or other statute over
which the FBI has jurisdiction. (Tab A)

Clause (3) recognizes that the Attorney General may
direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of Justice.\" This is a
possible statutory basis for at least two broad areas of FBI
intelligence investigations civil disturbance intelligence
and intelligence for the Federal Employee Security Program.

The most recent legal advice to the FBI from the Justice
Department on the gathering and reporting of data regarding
civil disturbances notes that on April 1, 1969, the President
designated the Attorney General as chief civilian officer to
coordinate the government's response to civil disturbances.
The FBI is instructed to gather and report on \"all significant
incidents of civil unrest\" and on \"all disturbances where there
are indications that extremist organizations are believed
to be involved in efforts to instigate or exploit them.\" The

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 13

3

FBI is spécifically advised to make reports \"even when no
specific violation of federal law is indicated.\" On the other
hand, the FBI is instructed not to report \"every relatively in-
significant incident of a strictly local nature coming to its
attention.\" (Tab B)

The Justice Department has given the following recent
instructions to the FBI regarding intelligence for the Federal
Employee Security Program. Executive Order 10450, as amended
by Executive Order 11785, is interpreted as requiring an FBI

investigation of organizations \"with a potential\" of violating
federal or state statutes prohibiting unlawful advocacy of vio-
lence or the commission of any unlawful act of violence. The
FBI is advised that \"it is not possible to set definite para-
meters covering the initiation of investigations of potential
organizations falling within the Order.\" The FBI is instructed
to apply \"the same yardstick\" to investigations of individuals
who are affiliated with such organizations. The FBI is specifi-
cally advised that \"it is not necessary that a crime occur
before the investigation is initiated.\" (Tab C)

Clause (3) also recognizes that the Attorney General
may direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of State.\" This is a pos-
sible statutory basis for FBI intelligence investigation of
foreign intelligence activities within the United States or to

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 14

4

collect positive foreign intelligence. The best example is
the Attorney General's authorization of warrantless FBI elec-
tronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. However,
there is apparently no instruction from the Justice Department
to the FBI directing the Bureau to initiate investigations of
individuals or organizations which have a marked potential for
use by a foreign intelligence service, but about which there is.
no information indicating intelligence 'activity. (See Staff
Report, \"Counterintelligence/Counterespionage: The Law and
the Philosophy\", October 14, 1975.)

In his testimony before the Committee, Deputy Associate
FBI Director James Adams made no reference to clauses (2) and
(3) as a possible legal basis for FBI intelligence investiga-
tions going beyond the investigation of specific federal crimes.
Instead, he placed sole reliance on a series of Presidential
directives extending from 1936 until the 1960's which the FBI
interprets as authorizing it to engage in \"domestic security
intelligence investigations\". The Attorney General has codified
these directives in a Justice Department regulation instructing
the FBI to:

Carry out the Presidential directive
of September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presi-
dential directives of January 8, 1943, July
24, 1950, and December 15, 1953, designating
the [FBI) to take charge of investigative
work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,
subversive activities, and related matters.
28 C.F.R., Section 0.85(d).

NW.88614 Docld:32989602 Page 15

5

The FBI also cites directives of President Kennedy on June 9,
1962, and Attorney General Kennedy on March 5, 1964, which
are the latest charter for the Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference, composed of the FBI Director and the chiefs of the
military intelligence agencies. This group is authorized to
coordinate \"all investigation of domestic espionage, counter-
espionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related intelligence
matters affecting internal security.\" (Tab D)

The theory behind the FBI's position is that the Presi-
dent has inherent constitutional powers, at least in the
absence of contrary legislation, to authorize FBI intelligence
activities. The only judicial support for this theory is
language in the Supreme Court's opinion in the Keith case,
which declared warrantless wiretapping of domestic groups un-
constitutional.

The Court acknowledged the importance of \"national secu-
rity in its domestic implications especially at a time
of worldwide ferment and when civil disorders in this country
are more prevalent than in the less turbulent periods of our
history.\" Under such circumstances, the Court stated, the
President has a \"fundamental duty\" under the Constitution to
\"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States.\" The Court added, \"Implicit in that duty is the power
to protect our Government against those who would subvert or
overthrow it by unlawful means.\" Hence, the Court appeared to
:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 16

-6

recognize that the President's \"domestic security role\" has a
\"constitutional basis\"; that the President through the Attorney
General may need \"to obtain intelligence information about those
who plot unlawful acts against the Government\"; and that \"threats
and acts of sabotage against the Government exist in sufficient
number to justify investigative powers with respect to them.\"
The Court applied the general principle, that \"unless the Govern-
ment safeguards its own capacity to function and to preserve

the security of its people, society itself could become so dis-.
ordered that all rights and liberties would be endangered.\"
Nevertheless, the central holding of the Keith decision was that
this power may not be exercised in such a way as to infringe
constitutional rights. 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

Even though the President may have the authority under
the Constitution to direct the FBI to conduct intelligence
investigations in the absence of legislation, Congress has the
ultimate authority to substitute statutory authorization in
place of the Presidential directives. As Justice Robert Jackson
declared in the Steel Seizure Case, \"When the President takes
measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.
*
343 U.S. 579,
637.

B. Option One Ratifying Existing Powers

The first option for Congress is legislation ratifying
the existing authority granted to the FBI by current Presiden-
tial directives and orders. Such legislation would be cast in
extremely general terms. Its main advantage is that it would
provide a basis for Congressional oversight. It could also
reinforce the Attorney General's role as the immediate super-.
visor of FBI intelligence activities. The statute would
authorize the Attorney General to direct the FBI:

1. to conduct investigations of domestic espionage,
counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive activities;

2. to gather and report information on civil distur-
bances;

3. to conduct investigations of other related intelli-
gence matters affecting internal security; and :

4. to conduct investigations of official matters relat-
ing to the Department of State.

In addition, the statute would require the Attorney General
to report annually to the appropriate Congressional committees
on the volume and type of investigations and reports, the
investigative techniques used, and the policies and procedures
adopted by the Justice Department and the FBI.

The weaknesses of this approach are obvious. Congress.
would have legislated a wholesale delegation of power without

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 18

8

standards or limitations other than the supervision of the
Attorney General and oversight by Congress. In view of the
Select Committee's findings as to the vast overbreadth of FBI
domestic intelligence investigations and the abuses committed
in the name of \"counterintelligence\", Congress would in effect
be permitting future expansion of FBI operations to match past
policies.

c. Option Two A Separate Security Intelligence Agency

Congress might give serious consideration to legislation
creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency within the
Justice Department. It would perform the functions of the
present Counterintelligence Branch of the FBI Intelligence
Division; dealing with foreign intelligence and counterintelli-
*gence/counterespionage. The FBI itself has considered this
option as part of the larger question of separating all FBI
intelligence functions from the law enforcement functions of
the Bureau. (Tab E)

A separate agency would be justified only if it was
authorized to conduct investigations of a wider scope and using
different techniques than would otherwise be permitted. In
other words, Congress could decide that foreign counterintelli-
gence investigations should go beyond investigation of specific
crimes, that techniques such as electronic surveillance should
be used without a warrant or with a special type of warrant,

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 19

9

and that operations should be conducted to \"counter\" foreign
intelligence activities by means other than arrest or \"persona
non grata\" proceedings. On the other hand, if Congress treats
the investigation of foreign intelligence activities the same
as a criminal investigation, then the FBI should keep the job.

Any statute in this area must use general language for
diplomatic reasons. For example, Congress should not explicitly
authorize deception operations or efforts to compromise hostile
intelligence officers, even though such techniques may be
envisioned. Such techniques are dealt with best by establish-
ing adequate procedures for authorization and oversight to
ensure accountability.

The legislation should be more specific where it deals
with investigations and other operations directed at American
citizens rather than non-resident aliens in the service of a
foreign power.. If Congress believes Americans should be inves-
tigated if they have a marked potential for use by a foreign
intelligence service, but no information indicating intelligence
activity yet exists, the legislation should say so.

The statute should also set out standards for determin-
ing whether a foreign-dominated domestic organization falls
within the jurisdiction of the separate agency. There should
at the very least be substantial information indicating that
the organization is directed by, subsidized by, or in active

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 20.

- 10

collaboration with a foreign government or organization. (The
term \"foreign organization\" refers, for instance, to a group
like the Palestine Liberation Organization.) If the group fits
the criteria for foreign domination, there should be an addi-
tional finding that it may engage in intelligence activities or
in activities involving the use of violence in violations of
federal law.

If the group meets all these standards, Congress may
authorize the investigation of its activities going beyond
regular criminal investigations. Such investigations could
extend to all individuals who are members of, or express sup-
port for, the organization, as well as to the efforts of the
organization to influence and control other groups. However,
it may be sufficient to authorize only the investigation. of
active members and supporters. This would prevent a revival
of the \"Cominfil\" policy of looking into all forms of lawful
political and social activity where Communists might be involv-
ed.

The Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO considered
the need for special supervision of foreign counterintelligence
operations in the United States. It recommended the creation
of a Foreign Intelligence Advisory Commission to make decisions
with regard to the necessity or acceptability of particular
foreign counterintelligence techniques. (Tab F) This proposal

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 21.

11

has merit in view of the limited amount of time the Attorney
General can give to personal supervision and the after-the-fact
role of legislative oversight regarding the separate agency.

Finally, legislation to create a separate foreign
counterintelligence agency must deal with relationships to the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, and other
foreign intelligence agencies. The current FBI-CIA agreement
on their respective jurisdictions is only a \"memorandum of under-
standing\". It allows the CIA to undertake certain clandestine
activities within the United States, in coordination with the
FBI. (Tab G) Proposals are currently circulating in the Execu-
tive Branch for a new National Security Council Intelligence
Directive to clarify this matter, as well as to regulate CIA
electronic surveillance of American citizens abroad. (Tab H)

A full draft of a statutory charter for a separate
foreign counterintelligence agency is not included here, since
the focus is on domestic intelligence issues.. However, one
implication of such a statute would be that the remaining FBI
functions should relate only to law enforcement and criminal
investigations.

D. Option Three Elimination of FBI Domestic Intelligence

The basic assumption behind Attorney General Levi's
effort to develop \"guidelines\" for FBI domestic intelligence
is that regular criminal investigations are not adequate to
:
NW 88614 DocId:32989602 Page 22

12

supply the information needed to anticipate or prevent the use
of violence in violations of federal. law. That assumption
should be questioned. Regular criminal investigations are
likely to produce a substantial amount of information which
can be used to anticipate or prevent future crimes. For example,
intensive criminal investigations of Ku Klux Klan violence in
the South during the 1960's would have required the FBI to look
into a wide variety of Klan activities. Another example is the
search for Weatherman fugitives, a regular criminal investiga-
tion which involves broad inquiries across the country. The
FBI has not yet demonstrated that the preventive information
it has obtained came from intelligence investigations which
would not have been conducted as regular criminal investigations.
.:
The fact that an FBI investigation was supervised by
its Intelligence Division does not necessarily mean that the
investigation was, automatically, outside the regular criminal
law enforcement jurisdiction of the Bureau. Any FBI investiga-
tion of activities involving the use of violence in violations
of federal law falls within that jurisdiction. Moreover,
regular criminal investigations can also extend to plans,
attempts, or conspiracies to engage in such activities.

One suggested difference between intelligence-type and
regular criminal investigations is that the latter are
terminated after a reasonable time, if sufficient evidence to

NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 23

13

justify prosecution is not obtained. However, there is no
legal. reason why the prosecutor cannot request that the inves-
tigation continue indefinitely as long as there is information
that violent activities and plans for violence are still under-
way. The degree of evidence needed to

On 12/4/75, a meeting was held with the following
representatives of captioned Committee: Chief Counsel F.A.O.
Schwartz; Assistant Counsel Paul Michel; Staff Member Mark
Gitenstein; Staff Director of the Domestic Task Force John T.
Elliff; and Staff Member John Bayley. Representing the Bureau
at this meeting were Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams,
Assistant Director John A. Mintz, Inspector John B. Hotis, and
SA Paul V. Daly.

The meeting discussed the forthcoming testimony on
12/9/75 of the Director before that Committee and Elliff fur-1
nished the Bureau two draft papers discussing the Bureau's
investigative jurisdiction and issues the Committee Staff feels
the Senate Select Committee must address from a legislative
standpoint. Copies of these papers are attached.

The first paper which consists of six pages discusses
in Part 1 what the Committee sees as problems arising out of
the FBI's domestic intelligence investigations. This portion
highlights the fact that these investigations may be overbroad
in scope, collect irrelevant information, and continue the in-
vestigations beyond what the Committee sees as their normal
investigative conclusion. This portion also addresses the
investigative techniques used during these investigations and
the resultant dissemination of information collected.

Under Part 2, the document discusses options available
to the Committee. These options run the gamut from abolition
of the Bureau's domestic intelligence functions to administrative
oversight by the Attorney General or Congressional oversight or
enacting legislation providing for domestic intelligence investi-
gations with legislative limits imposed on such investigations.
Included is the consideration of creating an independent

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

The second position paper which was prepared by
John T. Elliff begins by a six-page statement and analysis
of the Bureau's current authority to conduct domestic in-
telligence investigations. He then lists four options for
the Committee.

Option 1 is for Congress to pass legislation ratifying
the existing FBI authority as set forth by Presidential directives
and Executive Orders.

Option 2 suggests Congress might give serious con-
sideration to creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency
within the Department of Justice. In this Option, Elliff sug-
gests that the FBI itself has considered this Option as part of
the larger question of separating all FBI intelligence functions
from law enforcement functions of the Bureau.

Option 3 considers the elimination of FBI domestic
intelligence. In his analysis of this position, it might be
possible for the Bureau to develop the necessary intelligence
information through its normal criminal investigations and
thus remove the necessity for domestic intelligence investi-
gations as presently conducted.

Option 4 considers setting standards for domestic
intelligence investigations. In this Option, Elliff states
that the FBI should be authorized by statute to conduct domestic
intelligence investigations only as Congress finds that regular
criminal investigations would not provide information to an-
ticipate or prevent the use of violence in violations of Federal
law and that incidents of the use of violence in such violations
are of a serious nature and threaten the security of the country.

For purposes of the Director's appearance on 12/9/75
before the Senate Select Committee, it is believed his response
to questions concerning the aforementioned position papers should
be that the Bureau has received copies and is reviewing the various
proposals and that it would not be appropriate at this time for
the Director to comment regarding the substance of the proposals.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Elliff indicated during this meeting that the Director
during his appearance may anticipate being asked a question by
one of the Senators relating to his statement before the American
Bar Association in Montreal concerning the necessity for the
sacrifice of certain individual rights at the expense of investi-
gations. He also anticipated the Director might be asked a
question concerning his position on COINTELPRO. Regarding
the question concerning the Director's statement before the
American Bar Association in Montreal, the Legal Counsel Divi-
sion will draft a proposed resonse. Concerning COINTELPRO, a
response has been prepared and will be put together with the
briefing material for the Director.

This memorandum in general highlights the Options
presented in the attached papers. A more detailed analysis
should be prepared by the Intelligence Division and existing
documents addressing these proposals should be made available
for the Director's briefing book for his testimony.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Director respond to questions concerning
the attached position papers as set forth above.
Done.

(2) That the Legal Counsel Division draft a proposed
response concerning the Director's statement made in Montreal
relating to the sacrifice of certain individual rights.
Done.

(3) That the Intelligence Division make a detailed
review of the various Options set forth in the two attached
position papers. (FOR SUBSEQUENT STAFF CONFEE CA

Issues and Options for Discussion with
Former Attorneys General Rogers, Katzenbach, and Clark

I. Background

MDR-16
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 10/31/00 BY SPALMKP

In the past few weeks the staff has presented the Committee
with evidence suggesting the following about the FBI's
internal security intelligence program:

A. The program is massive, involving the collection of
information on the activities of thousands of innocent,
law-abiding American citizens.

B. These individuals were not alleged espionage agents, but
citizens who fall within the FBI's vague definitions of
\"subversion\" and \"extremism\" purely homegrown \"threats
to the national security\".

C. That FBI policy on \"subversive\" and \"extremist\" inves-
tigations was vague and subject to the following abuses:

1. overbreadth in scope in that groups were investigated
whose threats to the national security were tenuous,
if not non-existent.

2. collection of information on the personal life and
political views of subjects unrelated to the national
security.

3. the continuance of investigations well after it
should have become obvious that there was no legiti-
mate predicate.

D. Particularly invasive collection techniques were used,
including electronic surveillance, mail opening, and sur-
reptitious entries. Although these have been terminated,
the predominant and perhaps most insidious continues
today through the FBI's huge informant/confidential source
network.

E. Information collected in the course of these investiga-
tions is disseminated regularly throughout the federal
government and to local law enforcement.

F. Until 1971, information collected through these investi-
gations was disseminated as part of the COINTELPRO pro-
gram to the subjects' friends, relatives, employers, and
others in an effort to discredit or \"neutralize\" alleged
\"subversives\" or \"extremists\".

2

G. The FBI's internal security intelligence program was
used by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard
Nixon to serve their political interests, usually by
collecting information on critics or political
opponents.

H. The program was conceived and implemented in secrecy,
and although parts of the program were shared with out-
side authorities from time to time, until now no
President, Attorney General, or Congressional committee
has been exposed to the entire program in detail.

I. The program is not authorized by statute but is founded
on a series of secret or ambiguous Presidential orders,
which in turn are based upon a questionable assertion
of \"inherent constitutional authority\".

J. The program continues today, albeit on a much more
limited basis than in the late 1960's and early 1970's,
and the basic machinery for the program the huge
informant/confidential source network is still
operating.

K. There is no statute or internal Bureau or Justice Depart-
'ment policy prohibiting a new Director, Attorney General,
or President from ordering the Bureau to expand the pro-
gram to its earlier dimensions.

II. Issues and Options

Among the issues and options which might be discussed with
former Attorneys General in response to what the Committee
has learned are the following:

A. Abolition. Elimination of the FBI internal security
intelligence program as Attorney General Harlan Stone
ordered in 1924 when confronted with abuses growing out
of the FBI's first internal security intelligence pro-
gram, such as the infamous Palmer raids.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether there are not some functions (e.g., protecting
the President, preventing or at least predicting
violence by terrorist organizations, or predicting
civil disorders) which require intelligence collec-
tion.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 6

3

2. Whether FBI intelligence reports are valuable in
that respect, especially in light of a recent GAO
report suggesting that such reports are rarely use-
ful in predicting violent activity.

3. Whether such information, assuming it is valuable,
could not be obtained through more traditional criminal
investigations.

4. Whether the value of the information, marginal or
otherwise, justifies the risk to civil liberties
inherent in such intelligence collection.

5. Whether, given the way in which limited and ambiguous
grants of authority have been expanded into major
authorizations,any statute short of a total prohibi-
tion of all non-law enforcement intelligence activi
ties in the domestic sector will be adequate to pre-
vent the recurrences of the kinds of abuses uncovered
by this Committee. (Or, conversely, whether it is
possible to draft a law authorizing a limited civil
disturbance and counter-terrorist intelligence mission
that will not eventually evolve, like the National
Security Act of 1947, into a charter for unanticipated
and unwanted covert activities.)

6. Whether it would be sufficient to restrict the FBI
to criminal investigations without also (a) placing
limits upon the length of investigations, (b) the
kinäs of information which can be collected and dis-
seminated on the subject irrelevant to the alleged
criminal act, (c). the utilization of warrantless
electronic surveillance and other particularly inva-
sive collection techniques, and (d) the utilization
of a huge informant/confidential source network with-
out judicial or Justice Department supervision.

B. Authorizing Statute. Recognition of the value of
internal security intelligence, but placing limits upon
the program designed to minimize the infringement upon
civil liberties, an option being actively considered by
the present Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out under the first option and,
in addition:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 7

4

1. Whether meaningful and stringent guidelines can be
written which do not so hamper the administration
of an internal security intelligence program as to
make the product not just marginal, as GAO suggests,
but worthless.*

2. In light of the possibility that the present Attorney
General may address this matter via internal Justice
Department guidelines, whether this approach does
not ignore the legal authority question which can
only be resolved by statute.

3. Whether or not Congress could draft a statutory ver-
sion of the guidelines which could be flexible enough
to meet an evolving threat and at the same time
place meaningful restrictions upon the program.

4. Even assuming there is no absence of legal authority,
is it safe to leave these guidelines in the form of a
departmental order which can be rescinded by the next
Attorney General?

C. Delegation of Authority to Attorney General. Simply
ratifying the present program via enactment of a statutory
charter which grants the FBI authority to conduct an
internal security intelligence program subject to its own
internal guidelines or departmental guidelines as proposed
by the Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and:

1. Whether such a statute would not be an unconstitu-
tional delegation of powers to the Executive Branch.

2. Whether enactment of such a statute 'would not repre-
sent a failure by the Congress to confront the issues
raised above.

*A preliminary staff analysis of the Attorney General's draft
guidelines suggests that, despite months of conscientious and
painstaking work by a departmental task force, the guidelines
are not adequate. This analysis, which will be presented when
Attorney General Levi testifies on December 10, indicates that
several of the more questionable FBI investigations (e.g., of
Dr. King and the women's liberation movement) would still be
permissible under these proposed guidelines.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 8

5

D. Legislative Inaction. Enact no new statute affecting
the FBI's legal authority or the internal security intel-
ligence program.
:
In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and, in addition:

1. Whether this failure to act might not leave the
status of the program in doubt and subject to court
challenge.

2. Whether this failure to act after full disclosure
by the Bureau might not be taken by the FBI and the
courts as a ratification of the program.

E. Administrative Oversight by the Attorney General. The
Justice Department should be required to exercise greater
administrative oversight over the FBI's internal security
intelligence program by Attorney General Levi, regardless
of whatever other options Congress accepts.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is practical for the Attorney General or
his staff to review thousands of such investigations
each year.

2. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should
review all or just the so-called \"full\" investiga-
tions.

3. Whether, to facilitate the conduct of such reviews,
the Attorney General or his staff should be given
\"complete\" access to Bureau files, including informa-
tion regarding the identity and reliability of infor-
mants and confidential sources.

4. Whether it is possible to develop a staff of career
attorneys within the Department with both the access.
and independence essential to the conduct of search-
ing reviews.

5. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should not
also be required to review various informant and so-
called \"intensification\" programs, and the establish-
ment of specialized indices (which have a significant
impact upon which cases are opened) instead of just
reviewing individual investigations in a vacuum as
provided by the Attorney General's draft guidelines.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 9

6

F. An. Inspector General. In addition to the above options,
an independent Inspector General should be created to
investigate improprieties by the FBI. This option is
advanced by those concerned about the inadequacy of the
FBI's investigation of the disappearance of former
Director Hoover's personal files, its limited inquiry
into the so-called Atlantic City convention case, and
the absence of any internal investigation of the abuses
in the King case.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to maintain the independence
of an Inspector General within the Department of
Justice when both the Inspector General and the
Director of the FBI will be responsible to the same
official, the Attorney General.

2. Whether the Inspector General should have \"complete\"
access to Bureau files, including information per-
taining to the identity and reliability of informants
and confidential sources.

3. Whether an Inspector General with access to extremely
sensitive information might not become a serious
threat to the independence of the Bureau from politi-
cal influence and to the civil liberties of American
citizens.
:
G. Congressional Oversight. In addition to the above
options, the creation of an oversight committee(s) in the
Congress, to which the Bureau would be required to report
and which would have the power to investigate abuses.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the kinds of problems posed by the Justice Department
oversight and Inspector General options discussed above
to the independence of the FBI and the confidentiality
of its files.

H. Public Reporting and Disclosure to Subjects. In addition
to the above options, the requirement that the FBI make
frequent public reports on the details of its internal
security intelligence programs and policies and reveal
the details of improper intelligence investigations to
the subjects of those investigations.
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 10

7

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether it is possible to reveal the essence of some
programs and policies and the details of some inves-
tigations without jeopardizing the effectiveness of
legitimate programs.

2. Whether such disclosure might not increase the num-
ber of law suits filed against the FBI alleging
illegal activities.

DRAFT
MEMORANDUM

FBI LEGISLATION - PROPOSED OPTIONS
December 4, 1975.

In preparation for the testimony of FBI Director
Kelley and Attorney General Levi on December 9 and 10, the
Domestic Intelligence Task Force is pulling together various
proposals for legislation dealing with FBI intelligence.
This paper sets forth some of the basic options.

A: Current Statutes and Executive Orders

The basic statute governing the FBI is 18 U.S.C. 533,
which reads as follows:

The Attorney General may appoint officials:
(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against
the United States, (2) to assist in the
protection of the person of the President,
and (3) to conduct such other investigations
regarding official matters under the control
of the Department of Justice and the Depart-
ment of State as may be directed by the
Attorney General.

Clauses (2) and (3) are a possible statutory basis
for intelligence investigations going beyond the investigation
of specific federal crimes. Under (2), the FBI may \"assist\" the
Secret Service in the protection of the President by providing

intelligence on persons or groups who may endanger the Presi-
dent's safety. A formal agreement between the FBI and the
Secret Service sets forth the types of intelligence information
provided by the Bureau. However, this agreement states that:
:
-:
The FBI will not conduct investigation
of individuals or groups solely for the pur-
pose of establishing whether they constitute
a threat to the safety of the President and
certain other persons unless there is an
indication of a violation of Title 18, U. S.
Code, Section 1751, or other statute over
which the FBI has jurisdiction. (Tab A)
こ
Clause (3) recognizes that the Attorney General may
direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of Justice.\" This is a
possible statutory basis for at least two broad areas of FBI
intelligence investigations civil disturbance intelligence
and intelligence for the Federal Employee Security. Program.

The most recent legal advice to the FBI from the Justice
Department on the gathering and reporting of data regarding
civil disturbances notes that on April 1, 1969, the President
designated the Attorney General as chief civilian officer to
coordinate the government's response to civil disturbances.
The FBI is instructed to gather and report on \"all significant
incidents of civil unrest\" and on \"all disturbances where there
are indications that extremist organizations are believed
to be involved in efforts to instigate or exploit them.\" The
:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 13
:

FBI is spécifically advised to make reports \"even when no
specific violation of federal law is indicated.\" On the other
:
:
hand, the FBI is instructed not to report \"every relatively in-
significant incident of a strictly local nature coming to its
attention.\"
:
(Tab B)

The Justice Department has given the following recent
instructions to the FBI regarding intelligence for the Federal
Employee Security Program. Executive Order 10450, as amended
by Executive Order 11785, is interpreted as requiring an FBI
:
:
:
investigation of organizations \"with a potential\" of violating
federal or state statutes prohibiting unlawful advocacy of vio-
lence or the commission of any unlawful act of violence. The
FBI is advised that \"it is not possible to set definite para-
meters covering the initiation of investigations of potential
organizations falling within the Order.\" The FBI is instructed
to apply \"the same yardstick\" to investigations of individuals
who are affiliated with such organizations. The FBI is specifi-
cally advised that \"it is not necessary that a crime occur
before the investigation is initiated.\" (Tab C)
:
Clause (3) also recognizes that the Attorney General
may direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined \"official matters
under the control of the Department of State.\" This is a pos-
sible statutory basis for FBI intelligence investigation of
foreign intelligence activities within the United States or to
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 14

collect positive foreign intelligence. The best example is
the Attorney General's authorization of warrantless FBI elec-
:
tronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes.
:
However,
there is apparently no instruction from the Justice Department
to the FBI directing the Bureau to initiate investigations of
individuals or organizations which have a marked potential for
use by a foreign intelligence service, but about which there is.
no information indicating intelligence 'activity. (See Staff
Report, \"Counterintelligence/Counterespionage: The Law and
the Philosophy\", October 14, 1975.)
:
:
In his testimony before the Committee, Deputy Associate
FBI Director James Adams made no reference to clauses (2) and
(3) as a possible legal basis for FBI intelligence investiga-
tions going beyond the investigation of specific federal crimes.
Instead, he placed sole reliance on a series of Presidential
directives extending from 1936 until the 1960's which the FBI
interprets as authorizing it to engage in \"domestic security
intelligence investigations\". The Attorney General has codified
these directives in a Justice Department regulation instructing
the FBI to:

Carry out the Presidential directive
of September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presi-
dential directives of January 8, 1943, July
24, 1950, and December 15, 1953, designating
the [FBI) to take charge of investigative
work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,
subversive activities, and related matters.
28 C.F.R., Section 0.85(d).

NW.88614 Docld:32989602 Page 15

5
:
::
:
The FBI also cites directives of President Kennedy on June 9,
1962, and Attorney General Kennedy on March 5, 1964, which
are the latest charter for the Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference, composed of the FBI Director and the chiefs of the
military intelligence agencies. This group is authorized to
coordinate \"all investigation of domestic espionage, counter-
espionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related intelligence
matters affecting internal security.\" (Tab D)

The theory behind the FBI's position is that the Presi-
dent has inherent constitutional powers, at least in the
absence of contrary legislation, to authorize FBI intelligence
activities. The only judicial support for this theory is
language in the Supreme Court's opinion in the Keith case,
which declared warrantless wiretapping of domestic groups un-
:
constitutional.

The Court acknowledged the importance of \"national secu-
rity in its domestic implications especially at a time
of worldwide ferment and when civil disorders in this country
are more prevalent than in the less turbulent periods of our
history.\" Under such circumstances, the Court stated, the
President has a \"fundamental duty\" under the Constitution to
\"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States.\" The Court added, \"Implicit in that duty is the power
to protect our Government against those who would subvert or
overthrow it by unlawful means.\" Hence, the Court appeared to
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 16
:
:

-6
:
recognize that the President's \"domestic security role\" has a
\"constitutional basis\"; that the President through the Attorney
General may need \"to obtain intelligence information about those
who plot unlawful acts against the Government\"; and that \"threats
and acts of sabotage against the Government exist in sufficient
number to justify investigative powers with respect to them.\"
The Court applied the general principle, that \"unless the Govern-
ment safeguards its own capacity to function and to preserve
:
the security of its people, society itself could become so dis-.
ordered that all rights and liberties would be endangered.\"
Nevertheless, the central holding of the Keith decision was that
this power may not be exercised in such a way as to infringe
constitutional rights. 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

Even though the President may have the authority under
the Constitution to direct the FBI to conduct intelligence
investigations in the absence of legislation, Congress has the
ultimate authority to substitute statutory authorization in
place of the Presidential directives. As Justice Robert Jackson
declared in the Steel Seizure Case, \"When the President takes
measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.

B. Option One Ratifying Existing Powers
..
The first option for Congress is legislation ratifying
the existing. authority granted to the FBI by current Presiden-
tial directives and orders. Such legislation would be cast in
extremely general terms. Its main advantage is that it would
provide a basis for Congressional oversight. It could also
reinforce the Attorney General's role as the immediate super-.
visor of FBI intelligence activities. The statute would
authorize the Attorney General to direct the FBI:

1. to conduct investigations of domestic espionage,
counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive activities;

2. to gather and report information on civil distur-
bances;
..
3. to conduct investigations of other related intelli-
gence matters affecting internal security; and :

4. to conduct investigations of official matters relat-
ing to the Department of State.

In addition, the statute would require the Attorney General
to report annually to the appropriate Congressional committees
on the volume and type of investigations and reports, the
investigative techniques used, and the policies and procedures
adopted by the Justice Department and the FBI.

The weaknesses of this approach are obvious. Congress.
would have legislated a wholesale delegation of power without
:
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 18

8
-
standards or limitations other than the supervision of the
Attorney General and oversight by Congress. In view of the
Select Committee's findings as to the vast overbreadth of FBI
domestic intelligence investigations and the abuses committed
in the name of \"counterintelligence\", Congress would in effect
be permitting future expansion of FBI operations to match past
policies.

c. Option Two A Separate Security Intelligence Agency
Congress might give serious consideration to legislation
creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency within the
Justice Department. It would perform the functions of the
present Counterintelligence Branch of the FBI Intelligence
Division; dealing with foreign intelligence and counterintelli-
*gence/counterespionage. The FBI itself has considered this
option as part of the larger question of separating all FBI
intelligence functions from the law enforcement functions of
the Bureau. (Tab E)

A separate agency would be justified only if it was
authorized to conduct investigations of a wider scope and using
different techniques than would otherwise be permitted. In
other words, Congress could decide that foreign counterintelli-
gence investigations should go beyond investigation of specific
crimes, that techniques such as electronic surveillance should
be used without a warrant or with a special type of warrant,
し
:
竹
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 19

9
:
and that operations should be conducted to \"counter\" foreign
intelligence activities by means other than arrest or \"persona
non grata\" proceedings. On the other hand, if Congress treats
the investigation of foreign intelligence activities the same
as a criminal investigation, then the FBI should keep the job.

Any statute in this area must use general language for
diplomatic reasons. For example, Congress should not explicitly
authorize deception operations or efforts to compromise hostile
intelligence officers, even though such techniques may be
envisioned. Such techniques are dealt with best by establish-
ing adequate procedures for authorization and oversight to
ensure accountability.
:
The legislation should be more specific where it deals
with investigations and other operations directed at American
citizens rather than non-resident aliens in the service of a
foreign power.. If Congress believes Americans should be inves-
tigated if they have a marked potential for use by a foreign
intelligence service, but no information indicating intelligence
activity yet exists, the legislation should say so.

The statute should also set out standards for determin-
ing whether a foreign-dominated domestic organization falls
within the jurisdiction of the separate agency. There should
at the very least be substantial information indicating that
the organization is directed by, subsidized by, or in active
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 20.

10
:
(The
collaboration with a foreign government or organization.
term \"foreign organization\" refers, for instance, to a group
like the Palestine Liberation Organization.) If the group fits
the criteria for foreign domination, there should be an addi-
tional finding that it may engage in intelligence activities or
in activities involving the use of violence in violations of
federal law.

If the group meets all these standards, Congress may
authorize the investigation of its activities going beyond
regular criminal investigations. Such investigations could
extend to all individuals who are members of, or express sup-
port for, the organization, as well as to the efforts of the
organization to influence and control other groups. However,
it may be sufficient to authorize only the investigation. of
active members and supporters. This would prevent a revival
of the \"Cominfil\" policy of looking into all forms of lawful
political and social activity where Communists might be involv-
ed.

The Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO considered
the need for special supervision of foreign counterintelligence
operations in the United States. It recommended the creation
of a Foreign Intelligence Advisory Commission to make decisions
with regard to the necessity or acceptability of particular
foreign counterintelligence techniques. (Tab F) This proposal
NW 88614 Docld:32989602 Page 21.

11
-
.:
has merit in view of the limited amount of time the Attorney
General can give to personal supervision and the after-the-fact
role of legislative oversight regarding the separate agency.

Finally, legislation to create a separate foreign
counterintelligence agency must deal with relationships to the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, and other
foreign intelligence agencies. The current FBI-CIA agreement
on their respective jurisdictions is only a \"memorandum of under-
standing\". It allows the CIA to undertake certain clandestine
activities within the United States, in coordination with the
FBI. (Tab G) Proposals are currently circulating in the Execu-
tive Branch for a new National Security Council Intelligence
Directive to clarify this matter, as well as to regulate CIA
electronic surveillance of American citizens abroad. (Tab H)

A full draft of a statutory charter for a separate
foreign counterintelligence agency is not included here, since
the focus is on domestic intelligence issues.. However, one
implication of such a statute would be that the remaining FBI
functions should relate only to law enforcement and criminal
investigations.

D. Option Three Elimination of FBI Domestic Intelligence

The basic assumption behind Attorney General Levi's
effort to develop \"guidelines\" for FBI domestic intelligence
is that regular criminal investigations are not adequate to
:
NW 88614 DocId:32989602 Page 22
:

12
1
..
supply the information needed to anticipate or prevent the use
of violence in violations of federal. law. That assumption
should be questioned. Regular criminal investigations are
likely to produce a substantial amount of information which
can be used to anticipate or prevent future crimes. For example,
intensive criminal investigations of Ku Klux Klan violence in
the South during the 1960's would have required the FBI to look
into a wide variety of Klan activities. Another example is the
search for Weatherman fugitives, a regular criminal investiga-
tion which involves broad inquiries across the country. The
FBI has not yet demonstrated that the preventive information
it has obtained came from intelligence investigations which
would not have been conducted as regular criminal investigations.
.:
The
The fact that an FBI investigation was supervised by
its Intelligence Division does not necessarily mean that the
investigation was, automatically, outside the regular criminal
law enforcement jurisdiction of the Bureau. Any FBI investiga-
tion of activities involving the use of violence in violations
of federal law falls within that jurisdiction. Moreover,
regular criminal investigations can also extend to plans,
attempts, or conspiracies to engage in such activities.

One suggested difference between intelligence-type and
regular criminal investigations is that the latter are

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
RE: BLACK PANTHER PARTY

The Black Panther Party is a black extremist organ-
ization with national headquarters in Berkeley, California.
It now has affiliated groups in over 25 cities throughout the
United States and a membership exceeding 1,200.

The public statements of its leaders repeatedly
stress that the organization's objective is an armed black
revolution against the Government of the United States by
means of guerrilla warfare. Information is regularly
received showing that its members are required to possess
guns and have been instructed in their use. They have been
trained in the preparation of fire bombs and explosives. The
organization strongly supports the Cuban and Chinese Communist
revolutionaries.

Reviews of telephone toll call records and informa-
tion supplied by informants show that the leaders of the
organization use the telephone extensively.

The largest and most active Black Panther Party
chapter outside of the San Francisco Bay area is in
Los Angeles, California. The organization maintains several
offices in the Los Angeles area and has a headquarters office
at 4115 South Central Avenue, Los Angeles. The next most
active Black Panther Party group is located in New York City
which maintains its principal office at 2026 7th Avenue,
New York City.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

The telephone surveillance on the national head-
quarters of the Black Panther Party which was authorized on
February 4, 1969, has proved to be most valuable. It has
provided information concerning the planned establishment of
Black Panther Party branches at Eugene, Oregon; Fresno,
California; the Watts area of Los Angeles, California;
Syracuse, New York; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Columbus,
Ohio. It provided information concerning the removal of
Joudan Ford from his leadership position in the New York City
branch and, most recently, has furnished details concerning
the travel of National Chairman Bobby George Seale to the
Scandinavian countries where Seale is at the present time.

Live informants are furnishing information indicat-
ing that the organization will increasingly use underground
methods of operation which further emphasizes the desirability
of obtaining additional coverage to supplement data being
furnished by our live informants.

It is requested that authority be granted for
telephone surveillances on the Black Panther Party headquarters
at 4115 South Central Avenue, Los Angeles, and on the Black
Panther Party office at 2026 7th Avenue, New York City, or on
any other places to which they may move.

RE: BLACK PANTHER PARTY
NEW YORK DIVISION

You have previously authorized this Bureau to
initiate and continue a telephone surveillance on the
office of the extremist Black Panther Party (BPP) in
New York City located at 2026 Seventh Avenue. This
installation continues to provide significant data on
this group's plans and operations, and it is apparent
the BPP in New York City is second only to the national
headquarters in Berkeley, California from the standpoint
of generating plans for racial violence.

This Bureau has developed information that the
BPP in New York recently opened an office at 1370 Boston
Road, Bronx, New York! This office is known as the Black
Community Information Center and reportedly is to function
as the East Coast Information Center for the BPP. It is,
therefore, apparent that a telephone surveillance at this
location will provide access to invaluable data regarding
the BPP's plans and activities, not only on a local level
in New York City, but on a national scale as well.

It is, therefore, requested that authority be
granted for a telephone surveillance at the above location.
The telephone, concerning which coverage is requested, is
listed in the name of Ronald Morris, a known BPP member
in the New York area.

Reference is made to your letter dated May 6, 1969,
concerning the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
1968.

Mark Rudd national Weatherman leader, in a closed
meeting in early February, 1970, stated the Weatherman factio
of the Students for a Democratic atic Society would go underground,
break Into small groups and direct \"strategic sabotage\" against
military and police installations by the use of bombs and
confrontation with the police.

On March 6, 1970, a series of dynamite explosions
occurred in a multiple residential dwelling in New York City
in which (Weatherman) activists Theodore Gold and Diana Oughton
were killed. (Cathlyn Wilkerson national Weatherman leader,
was observed leaving the premises at the time of the explosions,
and it is believed other Weatherman members were also in this
building.

On March 18, 1970, a young Weatherman member in
Washington, D. C., advised her father that. that one of the next
things this group would become involved in was to bomb passenger
airplanes, including the Boeing 747, the largest passenger
plane in existence.

In late February, 1970, (Willian Avers was the leader
of a group of Weatherman in Detroit which made plans to bomb:
the Detroit Police Officers Association Building. On March 6,
1970, bombs consisting of ten sticks of dynamite and thirty-
four sticks of dynamite were located in az unexploded condition
at this building and at the 13th Precinct of the Detroit Police
Department, respectively.

On March 30, 1970, the Chicago Police Department
discovered a cache of fifty-nine sticks of dynamite in an
apartment at 5433 North Kenmore Street, Chicago. This
dynamite is identical in many respects to the dynamite found
in the Detroit police buildings on March 6, 1970. Investigation
has determined that this apartment was rented to Dianne Donghis
a Weatherman member who is presently in Buffalo, New Yor
on an unknown assignment. Also reported being seen at the
North Kenmore e Strect address was Naomi Jaffe Safier, who is
currently in y in buffalo with Donghi darte as she is most
commonly called, was in contact with Avers shortly prior to
March 6, 1970, when the dynamite was found in the Detroit
police installations.

Two Weatherman members were scheduled to appear in
a local criminal I court court in Detroit in early March, 1970, and
did not appear. Mr. Oliver Fein, 31 Vierrepout Street
Brooklyn New York, representing himself as their physician,
advised the court by telegram that these two individuals were
ill and unable to attend. Fein has been identified as a
possible doctor for many Weatherman members who are in an
underground status in the New York City area. He is 30 years
old and has been active in Students for a Democratic Society
affairs since 1964. He reportedly treated individuals injured
in Chicago in August, 1968, during the Democratic National
Convention. In late 1968, he was reportedly contributing
$1,400.00 monthly to Students for a Democratic Society He was
arrested in 1964 during a sit-in demonstration in Cleveland.
Fein is currently connected with the Health Policy Advisory
Center, 17 Murray Street, New York City, a radical medical
organization. Fein is a is a conscientious objector and reportedly
attempting to avoid the draft.

A source at Fein's residence, which is also his office,
has observed photographs on his desk of Cathlyn Wilkerson and
Kathie Boudin, Westherman leaders who are corontly wanted by
the FBI in connection with demonstrations in Chicago on
September 24, 1959, and October 9, 1969. Wilkerson is also
wanted by the FBI as a fugitive in connection with the dynamite
explosions at her father's residence in New York City on
March 6, 1970. This source source also advised there was a

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

A telephone surveillance on the address at
31 Pierrepont Street, Brooklyn) would undoubtedly provide
extremely valuable information concerning the possible
whereabouts of Weathermat members, including those members
presently being wanted by this Bureau as fugitives.
Weatherman members live in unknown residences referred to
as communes. Many have apparently moved to the New York City
area. It is well known that these individuals have a
continuing need for medical attention because of the filthy
conditions under which they currently live. Many use drugs
and many are known to be afflicted with venereal diseases.

Based on the information previously set forth,
it can be expected that all of the individuals who have access
to the phone at (31 Pierrepont Street. Brooklyn, either are
or may become subjects of either local or Federal criminal
violations. It is also anticipated, based on this information,
that results from a telephone surveillance at/31 Pierresent
Street Frooklyn, will be introduced as evidence in court
or that leads to evidence may be obtained; therefore, this
request is being made not only for the purpose of obtaining
intelligence-type information, but also on the basis that
evidence will be obtained that will be used in court. In
line with instructions on page five of your referenced letter,
the following information is set forth:

1. Some of the individuals who may utilize the
phone at 31 Pierrepont Street, Brooklyn, are currently the
subjects of Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution investigations.
Oliver Fein has stated he is a conscientious objector and is
trying to avoid the draft. It is further believed that
individuals having access to the phone at this address will
become involved in violations of the Destruction of Government
Property statute, the Destruction of Aircraft or Motor
Vehicles statute and the Antiriot Law.

2. At the present time, we are conducting both
intelligence and criminal investigations on the individuals
who may utilize this address and phone number. As previously
noted, many of the Weatherman members we are now investigating
arė fugitives. We do not have sufficient live informant
coverage of these individuals,

The captioned organization is a socialist-oriented

1,700 with chapters on 41 college campuses. The national
headquarters of this organization is located at/1103 East
63rd Street, Chicago, Illinois.

This organization has recently been extremely active
in staging protest demonstrations against United States action
in Vietnam and sponsored a \"Student March on Washington\" in
April, 1965, at which time approximately 15,000 demonstrators
paraded in front of the White House. Information has recently
been developed that within the Students for a Democratic
Society there is a secret group known as the Crisis Committee,\"
the purpose of which is to organize resistance to the forces
of the United States Government in the event of a crisis of
a national or international scale. Members of this Committee
would be called upon to block roads leading to missile bases,
persuade troops to desert or lay down their arms, and blockade
embarkation points.

An investigation of this organization is being

The Students for a Democratic Society is a part of
the New Left movement which is currently organized into
approximately 235 chapters throughout the United States. The
national headquarters is at 1608 West_Madison_Street, Chicago,
Illinois.

The Students for a Democratic Society is a fiercely
anarchistic group whose spokesmen boast of their determination
to end our form of Government and destroy the traditions of
democracy. Members of this organization have been in the fore-
front of the protest movement against United States policy in
Vietnam and have called for an end to selective service as well
as founding a number of antidraft unions.

During the past year drastic changes have occurred in
the tactics employed by the Students Students for a Democratic Society
to achieve their objectives. Students for a Democratic Society
leaders who formerly advocated \"nonviolence\" and \"passive
dissent\" are now urging the use of violence as a form of \"active
resistance\" against the existing social order. Confrontation
with school administrators now involves violence and heavy
destruction of school property. Since April, 1968, major dis-
orders precipitated by the revolutionary adherents of the
Students for a Democratic Society have occurred on a number of
college campuses.

At the Students for a Democratic Society National
Convention held in June, 1968, one of the workshops dealt with
explosives and sabotage techniques. The same militant mood
was in evidence at a Students for a Democratic Society National
Council meeting held in October, 1968, where pamphlets dealing
with the making of various explosive devices were made available
to the Students for a Democratic Society members.

At a (National Council meeting of this organization
held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in December, 1968, a manual cap-
tioned Work-In, a National SDS Summer Project was brought
to the attention of delegates to the meeting. This manual
which has received wide distribution in this country sets
forth a program by Students for a Democratic Society, to
invade industrial plants and other business ness organizations
this summer for the purpose of disrupting operations and
conducting an intensive propaganda campaign among employees
geared against the United States and particularly private
industry.

At an Eastern Regional Conference of the/Students
for a Democratic Society held on February 1-2, 1969, at
Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, a five-page
proposal entitled Smash the Military Machine in the Schools
was distributed by the Columbia University Students for a
Democratic Society chapter. This proposal called for fomenting
student uprisings, uprisings, agitational agitation demonstrations and other
disturbances and violence in universities and high schools
this spring throughout the country. It strongly emphasized
a nation-wide attack on Reserve Officers Training Corps on
college campuses.

While this proposal has never been passed in the
form of a resolution by the National Office of the Students
for a Democratic Society, it nevertheless has been implemented
on a number of occasions this spring by/Students for a
Democratic Society members and sympathizers The major attack
against Harvard University in April, 1969, was to abolish
the Reserve Officers Training Corps at the University. Such
attacks have also occurred at Yale University, George Washing-
ton University, Dartmouth College, Cornell University,
California State College, Michigan State University and at
many other colleges and universities.

At the Students for a Democratic Society National
o
Council meeting held in Austin, Texas, in March, 1969,
Michael Klonsky, Students for a Democratic Society National
Secretary, advocated that Students for a Democratic Society
become a strong, centralized, Marxist-Leninist, revolutionary
movement. Many of the national leaders of Students for a

The telephone surveillance mentioned above has
continued to be a source of extremely valuable, timely and
pertinent information concerning the activities, strategy,
plans, and operations of the Weatherman faction of the
Students for a Democratic Society. The Weatherman faction
has been in complete control of the national headquarters of
the Students for a Democratic Society since the June, 1969,
National Convention. The Weatherman faction is totally
committed to violent revolution at this time and has made
strategic plans to build an underground paramilitary organization
designed to carry out guerrilla warfare in the cities of the
United States.

Weatherman members have moved into collectives in
the major cities of the country and in an effort to keep
their whereabouts unknown to local and Federal authorities
are continuously moving from one collective to another.
Sensitive information from the telephone surveillance has enabled
the Federal Bureau of Investigation to locate many of these
individuals as well as ascertaining the location of their
frequently changing collectives. Furthermore, the identities
of persons who participated in the recent trip to Cuba sponsored
by the Venceremos Brigade have been furnished by this source.

Investigation by this Bureau has revealed that
the Young Lords has its principal offices in Chicago and
New York and is attempting to establish a nationwide organi-
zation based on Marxist-Leninist principles enunciated by
Communist China and Cuba. The Young Lords has received
political education from and has embraced the basic program
of the Black Panther Party. It has accepted aid and direction
from revolutionary Puerto Rican groups seeking independence
for Puerto Rico. Its publication, \"YLO,\" is replete with
calls for revolutionary action.

The New York Young Lords in December, 1969, seized
a neighborhood church and held it for ten days before being
evicted by police action. On March 5, 1970, an officer
of the Young Lords in New York stated before a college audience,
\"From now on when the fascist pigs point guns at us, we will
retaliate.\" The same speaker continued that he and his
brothers in the Young Lords would no longer remain calm but
would be violent \"from this day on.\"

Your authorization is requested to institute
telephone surveillance coverage on the New York headquarters
of the Young Lords located at 1678 Madison Avenue, New York,
New York, for a period of three months. This installation
will be made away from the premises and will not involve

It is expected that the requested telephone
surveillance coverage will provide valuable intelligence
information vital to the internal security concerning the
Young Lords efforts to establish a national organization,
its connections with the Black Panther Party and Puerto Rican
independence groups, as well as provide intelligence regarding
potential violence by this group. NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION

dated March 27, 1970, captioned The Young Lords Organization,
1678 Madison Avenue, New York, New York, Internal Security
Young Lords, approved by you on March 30, 1970, seeking
authority to institute a telephone surveillance on the
New York headquarters of the Young Lords Organization.

On May 25, 1970, captioned New York group split
from the Chicago group of the Young Lords Organization on the
grounds that the Chicago group was not providing leadership
to form a successful revolutionary party. The Young Lords
Party has retained the same program, leadership, membership,
and headquarters in New York as its predecessor.

Our coverage of the captioned organization has
resulted in obtaining valuable data concerning the travels of
the leaders and plans for a demonstration of the captioned
organization. Coverage has also furnished valuable data con-
cerning the organizational and financial structure of the group
and has furnished data concerning the identity of at least 15
new members of the group. The installation enables this Bureau
to gain valuable intelligence data concerning the activities
and scope of this revolutionary group.

Reference is made to this Bureau's memorandum dated
June 19, 1970, and approved by you on the same date wherein
you approved continuation of telephone surveillance at the
headquarters of the YLP in New York for a three-month period,
effective June 30, 1970.

It has been determined that telephone service at YLP
headquarters has been terminated due to nonpayment of the
telephone bill. Accordingly, the coverage previously approved
by you is being discontinued, effective July 15, 1970.

The YLP continues to have telephone service at its
Bronx, New York, chapter which is also the center for publica-

that YLP activity in the New York area will now be centered at
the YLP office, Bronx, New York. Previous technical surveillance

TOP SECRET

United Arab Republic (UAR) Ambassador to U.S. advised
his country 8/26/60 Senator John Kennedy delivered speech to
Zionist's Congress re solution Arab-Israeli dispute. UAR
Ambassador stated speech contained fallacies and exaggerated
statements and promises. UAR Ambassador subsequently contacted
by Senator J. W. Fulbright, Chairman, Foreign Relations Committee,
who apologized for Kennedy's speech and explained it was dictated
by political expediency.

On 9/22/60, National Security Agency furnished an
intercept of coded diplomatic traffic from U AR Ambassador to
Cairo, dated 8/26/60, classified \"Top Secret Daunt\" as it
relates to communications intelligence

According to the intercept, UAR Ambassador claimed
Senator Fulbright stated Kennedy's speech was not an expression
of what could be considered policy of Democratic administration
with Kennedy as President.

UAR Ambassador reportedly advised Senator Fulbright
of (Ambassador's official displeasure with Senator Kennedy's
speech as it was replete with fallacies and bias and disparagements
regarding UAR rights and disregarded UAR feelings, thus indicating
Senator Kennedy places personal interest before justice and
interests of U.S. Senator Fulbright was advised continued efforts
to obtain Jewish votes at expense of Arabs will have serious con-
sequences, and (UAR Ambassador expected Senator Fulbright to exert
efforts to end such activities. Senator Fulbright stated he would
attempt to comply with this request

UAR Ambassador advised his superiors Senator Fulbright
contacted him probably after consulting with Senator Kennedy
whose speech was motivated by Senator Kennedy's desire to
obtain Jewish, Catholic, and Negro minority votes in order to
compensate for his loss of votes among Protestant majority which
opposes Kennedy because of his Catholicism. The Ambassador was

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

CONSULATE OF ISRAEL - NEW YORK CITY, N.Y.
ENTERNAL SECURITY - IS

In several communications to you during the past
year concerning Israeli intelligence operations in the
United States, information has been forwarded regarding an
espionage ring operated by the Israeli Government in
New York City. This ring was headed by Youval Tal who
until March 29, 1954, when he departed from the United States,
was an adviser to the Israeli Delegation to the United Nations.
Also included in this ring were Yigal Giland and Efrain
Pillersdorf, employees of the Consulate of Israel, New York
City.

The Department of State has informed this Bureau
that on April 14, 1954, Assistant Secretary of State Henry A.
Byroade conferred with Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban and
expressed to him the disquiet of our Government at the
activities of Tal, Gilaad, and Pillersdorf. Mr. Byroade
noted the fact that Tal had recently left the United States
and told the Israeli Ambassador that our Government con-
sidered it desirable that Gilaad and Pillersdorf also be
withdrawn.

It is anticipated that the departure of these
three men from the United States probably will not
result in the discontinuance of Israeli intelligence
activities in the New York area. Since the activities
have centered about the Israeli Consulate there in the
past it is possible that they will continue to be con-
ducted from that establishment. Accordingly, it is
recommended that you authorize technical coverage at

DAVID LYNN MITCHELL was interviewed at the Sierra
Conservation Center, Jamestown, California. MITCHELL was
warned of his rights by Special Agent DONALD H. MOE and
he waived them, as shown on an executed warning and waiver
form. MITCHELL furnished signed statement as follows:

February 26, 1969
Sierra Conservation Center
Jamestown, California

\"I, DAVID LYNN MITCHELL, furnish the follow-
ing voluntary statement to DONALD H. MOE and SANTO
O. TRONAS, who have identified themselves to me as
Special Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion. Mr. Moe has told me that this inquiry relates
to the identification of an individual or individuals
to whom jewelry was sold. This jewelry had previously
been taken by me from the house of ADDIE KATHERINE
EARLE. Mr. Moe exhibited five photographs of five
different persons to me. From this group of photo-
graphs, I selected a photograph which I identified
as a photograph of an individual known to me as
FRANK WALLS. This is the person to whom I sold
an emerald ring while in the office of the Canal
Jewelry and Loan Company in New Orleans, Louisiana.

\"This office was located at the rear of
the Canal Jewelry and Loan Company and could not
be viewed from the store, itself. The office con-
tained a large, double doored safe, two or three chairs, to gain entrance to the office,
requiring going up two or three stairs, in the rear
of the store.\"

he noticed the following described employees in the store.

1. A young man who worked behind the \"wire
cage\" where merchandise was pawned, six feet,
light colored hair, mid-20's

2. A woman in her mid-40's with grayish black
hair who worked behind the cashier's desk.

3. A salesman, very short, about five feet
five inches with a mustache.

He could furnish no additional descriptive data
concerning the above individuals advising that he only saw
them in the store and did not talk to them.

MITCHELL stated that the safe in which the jewelry
was placed by WALLS was a large, double doored safe located
in the office of Canal Jewelry and Loan. He advised that
the office was located at the rear of the store; that upon
entering the store, you walk straight back, up two or three
stairs and turn right to enter the office.

MITCHELL stated that WALLS went with his mother,
BETTY MITCHELL, in about 1951 or 1952, when MITCHELL was
six or seven years of age. MITCHELL said that at that
time, he and his mother were living in an apartment in
Galveston, Texas, adjacent to a beauty parlor. The owner-
operator of the beauty parlor, name not recalled, resided
in an upstairs apartment; she was their landlady. This
apartment and beauty parlor is still in existence and as
of about one year ago, was still owned and operated by the
same woman. It is located directly North, and adjacent to
a Sears Roebuck & Company parking lot. The parking lot is

located directly East, and adjacent to the Sears Roebuck &
Company store. The Beauty Shop operator-landlady was a
close friend of the mother of MITCHELL and was acquainted
with WALLS.

MITCHELL could furnish no information about the
name or location of the club allegedly operated by WALLS
in Galveston at that time.

MITCHELL stated he is certain that the name used
by WALLS in Galveston was FRANK WALLS since he recognized
this name when he saw WALLS in New Orleans; thereafter, he
asked WALLS if he was the same WALLS that had gone with
his mother and WALLS affirmed that he was.

Prior to May 1959, ANGELO BRUNO told Philadelphia
Confidential Informant T-2 that he, BRUNO, was one of the
interest holders in the Hotel Plaza Gambling Casino and
that this casino had received permission to reopen in June
1959. It was said that in August 1959 the following
gambling casinos continued to be opened in Havana for
operation:

Tropicana Hotel
Havana Hilton Hotel
Hotel Nacional
Capri Hotel
Havana Riviera Hotel

The remaining gambling casinos, including the
Hotel Plaza Gambling Casino, were closed either because
of Government edict or financial difficulties.

It was also stated that on August 14, 1959, GLEN
ASMUSSEN, Immigration and Naturalization Service, telephonically
advised the Miami Office that ANGELO ANNALORO had arrived
from Havana, Cuba, via Pan American Airlines, flight #420
at 8:15 p.m., August 14, 1959. The residence address of
ANNALORO, an alias used by BRUNO, was 934 Snyder Avenue,
Philadelphia, Pa. ANNALORO said he was a citizen of the
United States.

On September 28, 1959, Inspector WALLACE SHANLEY,
U. S. Customs, Miami, advised SA CHARLES W. ADMISTON that
he had received no information concerning ANGELO BRUNO'S
activities, either in Havana or the Dominican Republic.

Trash Removal Contracts
City of Philadelphia

As previously reported ANGELO BRUNO was making
arrangements in Philadelphia through Philadelphia City
Councilman PAUL D'ORTONA to receive a contract with the

4

NW 78318 Docld:34489331 Page 9

PH 92-444

city of Philadelphia to haul trash and garbage from Philadelphia
via water.

On October 15, 1959, Philadelphia Confidential
Informant T-3 said that ANGELO BRUNO met on the evening of
October 14, 1959, with SAM ROSE, Philadelphia City Councilman,
to discuss BRUNO's proposed contract with the city of
Philadelphia for removal of trash. T-3 said that BRUNO
had indicated that the land purchased, described below,
was about to be concluded and that POLLINAwho made the down
payment on the land was not DOMENICK POLLINA, Philadelphia
Top Hoodlum. T-3 did not know if this POLLINA was the
relative of DOMENICK POLLINA.

On October 7, 1959, U. S. Game Management Agent
in New Jersey HARRYCE. GREENWALD advised SA IRVING R. DEAN
that an 800 plus acre plot of land on the south side of
Mad Horse Creek in Salem County, N.J. was owned by RIESS
EWEN of Salem, N.J. This land was said to be surrounded
by a 2500 acre plot owned by THOMAS DICKSON, Clerk of the
County Court of Salem, N.J. who is fighting the sale of
the 800 acres owned by EWEN to one (FNU) POLLINA, described
as a South Philadelphian who had made a down payment of
$3500 toward a purchase price of $75.00 per acre for EWEN'S
acreage. It was said that the state of New Jersey had
offered EWEN $35.00 an acreffor his land as a proposed
public shooting grounds for wild ducks.

GREENWALD also said that the Salem, N.J. City
Council unanimously opposed the sale of EWEN's acreage
when it became known that the acreage was intended for a
garbage disposal area. Two weeks after this action, however,
it is alleged that the entire City Council of Salem, N.J.
reversed its decision and voted for the sale of EWEN'S
property, knowing that it was to be used as a garbage
disposal area.

The property was described as being only
accessible by water and that the only obstacle holding up
the sale of the land at the present time is the riparian
rights to the land which is now in the process of litigation.

On October 19, 1959, GREENWALD advised SA DEAN
that THOMAS DICKSON, described above, was contacted by an
individual, presumably a JOHN POLLINA, in an endeavor to
purchase his 2500 acre plot in Salem, N.J. GREENWALD
allegedly was told by DICKSON that it was demanded that
he set a price for his land and that DICKSON would be
contacted Wednesday evening, October 21, 1959, for his
answer. GREENWALD said that DICKSON had called him and
related this information. DICKSON was said to be extremely
worried over what may happen to him or his family if he
does not sell the land.

By letter October 26, 1959, the Newark Division
advised that THOMAS PANCOAST DICKSON on October 20, 1959,
was interviewed by SA ROBERT D. ALDRICH and advised as
follows:

DICKSON did not know other than from rumor who
was involved in the sale of land to the land adjoining
his property for the purpose of using it as a garbage
disposal area. He had been approached to sell his land
by CHARLES ACTON, Swedesboro, N.J., a real estate dealer.
No threats were made to him but ACTON told him that the
people he represented \"had to have the land\" and for him
to name his price and they would buy.

DICKSON has heard from sources unrecalled that
the POLLINAS were the persons behind the project but he
observed that there appeared to be a great deal of political
pressure coming from the State of New Jersey regarding the
matter. It appeared that the state wanted to use Salem
County as a dump ground for the whole state since dumping
on the North Jersey meadows has been stopped.

A. W. W. HOWELL, Box 459, Parsippany, N.J., told
DICKSON that the state of New Jersey had made an official
investigation concerning the matter so he, DICKSON,
called a Detective Sergeant EMIL DALINT of the New Jersey
State Police at West Trenton, N.J., who admitted to him
that such an investigation had been made and a file
existed but that he preferred that DICKSON talk to his
superior, Deputy Attorney General JOHN J. BURGIN for any
official information. DICKSON did not proceed further.

NW 78318 Docld:34489331 Page 11

PH 92-444

DICKSON said that local meetings have been held in
Salem in an effort to get an ordinance passed forbidding
any such dumping and an official of the City Health Department,
one JOHN ZEMHAMPSKI (phonetic) has appeared and argued
strongly against passage of such restrictions. In DICKSON'S
opinion this man had no business at such a meeting. DICKSON
said there had been many rumors around Salem concerning large
payoffs to New Jersey state officials but DICKSON cannot
substantiate any of these. DICKSON said he would attempt
to cooperate with the FBI in every way should threats be made
to him as he definitely did not intend to sell his land for
a dump.

T-3 on October 9, 1959, said that BRUNO had stated
that they were then ready to purchase land at Salem, N.J.
but BRUNO furnished no additional information. It was also
said that BRUNO stated that all of the City Councilmen in
Philadelphia were going to get a \"cut\" from this business
venture. Councilmen SAMUEL ROSE and PAUL D'ORTONA were said
to be the most active in the proposed business venture. It
was said that Chief Magistrate JOSEPH HERSCH had a definite
interest in the matter. On October 15, 1959, T-3 said that
HERSCH was a close, personal friend of BRUNO.

T-3 said that the land in Salem, N.J. had been
purchased with a $20,000 down payment and had a $47,000
balance remaining. It was said that the agreed price would
be $2.65 per ton for removal of garbage from the city.
MICKEY ROSE, a relative of Councilman SAMUEL ROSE, will be
the front for the group. Itlis noted that i has previously
been reported that the investment in this venture will be
approximately $400,000.

G. TRAVEL

On October 26, 1959, Lieutenant TOM CLOONEY,
Philadelphia Police Department, advised SA THOMAS F. CARRIG
that ANGELO BRUNO had been observed by him driving a grey
Pontiac sedan with New Jersey registration X/M 9530 J.
The Newark Division advised on October 30, 1959, that New
Jersey registration \"Commercial\" X/M 9530 J is registered to
the J. C. Vending Machines, Inc., 947 Southard Street, Trenton,
N.J., for a 1957 Pontiac coupe.

Reurtel 8/30/61.

According to retel an informant advised that gamblers
in the New Kensington area are saying that since Willie Sams is
never caught in Internal Revenue Service raids he either has a'
highly placed tipster in the Pittsburgh Federal Building or he is
an informant for some Federal agency.

You should take immediate advantage of this information
and turn it to our benefit. You should certainly be able to use
this material as an aid in obtaining good information from Sams
and/or to disrupt his portion of the Mannarino racket empire.

Re Bureau airtel 10-26-65 and your airtel 11-4-65.

It is not felt that the letterhead memorandum
submitted with your airtel contains sufficient specific
information to resolve the question raised by Swiss authorities
concerning the identity of Alex and the proof that he is the
individual who is the subject of the Swiss entry ban.

You should resubmit a revised letterhead memorandum
containing more detailed and evidential type information to
support the identification of Alex as a leading Chicago
hoodlum figure and as the person banned by Swiss authorities.
Consideration should be given to setting forth any pertinent
information as to Alex's record of arrests. Also dates of pert-
inent travel to Europe and Switzerland and passport data on Alex.

Also advise Bureau of pertinent handwriting comparison
which can be made to establish that Alex is the person who
visited Switzerland and submit any necessary specimens in order
that the Laboratory can immediately make indicated comparison.

Legat has requested this matter be given prompt
attention and in view of this, you should resubmit requested
material by 11-11-65.
NOTE: Chicago hoodlum Gus Alex and his paramour visit Switzerland
each winter on vacation and Legat Bern has established appropriate
doverage in past years through Swiss authorities. Following last
visit of Alex during past winter Swiss authorities issued a prohibit-
ion against Alex's re-entry into this country on the basis that he
was an undesirable. Alex has appealed and Swiss police now advise
they feel there is some question of identity as to whether there are
two persons by the name of Gus Alex involved and have requested
further verification concerning this.

Re Bureau airtel to Chicago dated 10/26/65.

Enclosed herewith are six (6) copies of a letterhead

A photo of GUS ALEX taken in Los Angeles in 1959
at the time of his arrest there.

A photo of GUS ALEX and SUZANNE FUEGER taken in
Switzerland in 1963.

A photo and signature of ALEX as it appeared on
his passport in 1959.

It is suggested that Swiss authorities may desire
to obtain an affidavit from GUS ALEX to confirm or deny his
identity and his presence regarding specific travels in
Switzerland. His refusal to execute an affidavit could be
a basis for denying ALEX future entry into Switzerland.

GUS ALEX
ANTI-RACKETEERING

The following information is set forth to
substantiate the fact that Gus Alex, the subject of the
Swiss entry ban and member of the Chicago underworld,
is identical with the Gus Alex who claims residence
in Evergreen Park, Illinois, and employment in the publicity
department of the De Luxe Cigarette Service, Incorporated,
Niles, Illinois.

Enclosed is one copy of a photograph of Gus Alex
taken when he was arrested in 1959 by the Los Angeles,
California, Police Department, and of Alex and his paramour,
Suzanne Fueger, taken in Switzerland in 1963. Both photographs
represent the same individual who is recognized by the Chicago
Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel as
the person observed in almost daily contact and association
with other top ranking hoodlums in Chicago. He is also
identical with the individual about whom this correspondence
concerns.

Alex actually resides in apartment 10 C at 1150
North Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, however, in order to hide
his identity he has utilized his recently deceased mother's
address, 9353 South Spaulding, Evergreen Park, Illinois, for
mailing purposes. On numerous occasions Alex has been observed
entering his mother's residence and has parked his automobile
in front of this address. Her telephone number was Garden
3-8675, Area Code 312, which telephone was listed to Mrs. Nick
Alex. It is noted that Alex called this number on several
occasions while visiting Switzerland in the past.

RE: GUS ALEX
ANTI-RACKETEERING

It has been reported by the Swiss Central Police
Bureau that Alex's employer, De Luxe Cigarette Service,
Incorporated, certified that he has worked in their publicity,
department since 1957 and has never given any reason for
complaints.

It is noted that Alex claims income from this
company which company for years has been reportedly controlled
by hoodlums. Alex now is reportedly in charge of this company
having taken it over from a close friend and fellow hoodlum,
Edward Vogel. Alex on numerous occasions has been observed
at this location with his chauffeur and body guard Nathan
\"Butch\" Ladon.

In 1958 Alex was summoned to Washington, D.C., to
appear before the Mc Clellan Senate Rackets Committee investigating
hoodlum infiltration into labor and business in Chicago.
Alex refused to cooperate and furnished no information, taking
refuge behind the 5th Amendment. He refused to answer all
questions except for his name and address.

Grand Jury [JFK Law 10 (a)2]

Captain William Duffy, Operating Director,
Intelligence Section, Organized Crime Division, Chicago
Police Department, advised that Gus Alex is a top ranking
member of organized crime in Chicago and is closely allied
with the top ranking members of the hoodlum element. Duffy
advised further that he has maintained continuous investigation
of Alex for years and of Alex's affiliations with the De Luxe
Cigarette Service, Incorporated. Duffy stated that Alex
has been completely uncooperative and that there is no question
concerning his involvement with Chicago's underworld in
organized crime.

FROM : SAC, MIAMI (92-88)

SUBJECT: SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR., aka.
ANTI-RACKETEERING
(00 - Miami)

On 5/11/59, MM-416-C furnished information
concerning the captioned subject to SA JAMES P. O'NEIL.

The informant stated that recently publicity
was afforded the forth coming marriage of the subject's
daughter, MARY JO TRAFFICANTE, to AUGUST C. PANIELLO.
PANIELLO, according to the informant, is the son of the late
Dr. SANTIAGO PANIELLO and Mrs. ELVIRA PANIELLO, presently re-
siding in the Embassy Apartments, Tampa, Florida.

The subject's daughter is currently attending
the University of Tampa, Tampa, Florida, and is a member of
the Sophomore Class. PANIELLO, a graduate of the University
of Tampa, is a student at the Stetson University College of
Law, St. Petersburg, Florida.

The informant related that the wedding, scheduled
for an unspecified date in 6/59, was opposed by the subject and
his wife, partially because PANIELLO was previously married and
divorced. The informant stated that the wedding, according to
information from sources in Tampa, will take place in Havana,
Cuba, and the reason given is to avoid any publicity and the
subject's presence in Tampa.

This information is being furnished to the Bureau
for transmittal to the Legat, Havana, as there is the possi-
bility that the wedding may be the occasion for a gathering of
associates of TRAFFICANTE, particularly those highly placed in
the Underworld.

Germany.

On December 22, 1964, ALEX and FUEGER left Zurich

car in question was a \"Peugeot 404\" which ALEX rented from
Hertz AG. On leaving the hotel he hired a taxi stationed at
the Dolder Grand Hotel, which acted as a guide in front of
his car as far as the outskirts of Zurich.

The driver of this taxi was later interviewed by
the Zurich Police. He stated that he had driven ALEX on
various occasions, e.g. on January 27, 1964, to Kloten Air-
port. On said journey ALEX had been looking time and again.
to see whether any car was following the taxi. ALEX had
then mentioned that he knew very well he was being watched
by the police by order of his native country.

The driver also mentioned that after he had guided
ALEX and FUEGER out of town on December 22, 1964, ALEX had
asked him whether he would be available on January 5, 1965.
He, ALEX, would return on that day to Zurich.

In this respect, Zurich Police informed that ALEX
reserved two rooms at the Dolder Grand Hotel for January 5.

had flown from London to California, then to Las Vegas,
Nevada, then to New York, and then to Miami, before return-
ing to Tampa for the Labor Day weekend. TRAFFICANTE appar-
ently did not detail time in London, nor give any indication
of how much time he had spent in each of the above-mentioned
locations. TP 41-C of the opinion from TRAFFICANTE'S
remarks that he had had a companion on his London, England,
trip, but identity not known at this time. Investigation
has indicated that British officials are aware that DINO
CELLINI is Managing Director of the Colony Club, Berkley
Square, London, and CELLINI has in the past been identified
as an associate of SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.

In addition, on October 7, 1966, TP 120-C ad-
vised that sometime prior to 9/22/66, TRAFFICANTE's 5-year-old
grandson, SANTOS PANIELLO, who resides with his mother, Mrs.
AUGIE (MARY JO) PANIELLO, at 2505 Bristol, Tampa, had re-
ceived a box containing a very expensive-looking cowboy
suit. TP 120-C indicated that this box containing the
cowboy suit was from the Indian Trading Post, Yellowstone
National Park, but that the wrapping, which would indicate
air mailed and how addressed, had been removed from the box.

For the additional information of Butte and WFO,
TRAFFICANTE has in the past, when securing air passage,
used the names contained on the LCN membership card index
and the names T. MOETOS, JAMES BRUNO, ED VALDEZ, and JOE
GARCIA, the latter name having been used by TRAFFICANTE in
traveling to the meeting in New York during September 1966.
TRAFFICANTE has a current U. S. passport issued in the
name of SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR., # F-391387, issued 5/28/65
at Miami, Fla. Previous investigation has indicated that
Bureau of Customs had placed stops with INS concerning
TRAFFICANTE's foreign travels, but Tampa not in possession
of any indication that INS or Bureau of Customs has infor-
mation that TRAFFICANTE recently out of the U. S.

Tampa has submitted FD-315 requesting F-1 and

Tampa 5/18/66 and was confined St. Joseph's Hospital,
Tampa from dateoof accident until 6/19/66.

TP 120-C, who has daily access to TRAFFICANTE'S
Tampa residence, on 6/11/66, indicated no visitors had
been at the residence during the past few days. It is
further noted that TRAFFICANTE's married daughter, her
husband, and their five year old son also maintain their
home at TRAFFICANTE's Tampa residence.

In addition, records airport parking, Miami
Airport, indicate that TRAFFICANTE's automobile was not
on the parking lot during the period of 5/27/66 to 6/4/66,
which would suggest from past experience that TRAFFICANTE
was actually present in the Miami, Florida area from
5/27/66 to 6/4/66. Likewise, records indicate that
TRAFFICANTE's automobile was on the parking lot from 6/4/66
until 6/10/66 which would suggest that TRAFFICANTE was not
in Miami. Possibility therefore exists that MARCELLO'S
visit mentioned in referenced airtel would have been to
TRAFFICANTE's Miami residence instead of his Tampa residence.

Furthermore, TP 120-C on 7/6/66 indicated that
TRAFFICANTE, his wife, their daughter, and her family had
spent some of the July 4th weekend at least at TRAFFICANTE'S
St. Petersburg Beach residence located at 3610 El Centro.
Likewise, records of the airport parking lot, Miami, in-
dicate that TRAFFICANTE's automobile was parked on the airport
parking lot from 6/27/66 to 7/2/66 at which time it was
removed from the lot at 12:52 p.m. Records further re-
flect that the car again appeared on the parking lot at 6:07
7/2/66 and remained on the parking lot until 11:22 p.m.,
7/6/66. From TRAFFICANTE's habit pattern, it thus appears
that he was out of the Miami area from 6/27/66 to the after-
noon of 7/2/66 and then from evening of 7/2/66 to 7/6/66.

New Orleans's attention is called to New Orleans
file 162-156 captioned \"AUGUSTINE PRIMO LAZZARA\" and New
Orleans file 92-320 captioned \"JOSEPH MARCELLO, JR.\" which
indicates some contact between LAZZARA and MARCELLO and it
is an established fact that AUGUSTINE PRIMO LAZZARA is a
very close associate of SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.

NEW ORLEANS DIVISION

New Orleans is requested to furnish Tampa suitable
photographs of CARLOS MARCELLO, JOSEPH MARCELLO, JR., and
their wives for exhibition to TP 120-C and other sources
familiar with TRAFFICANTE's associates. Only photograph at
present available to Tampa of CARLOS MARCELLO is that con-
tained on LCN membership index card.

SUBJECT: SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR., aka
ANTI-RACKETEERING

Reference Havana letter dated June 10, 1959.

HAV-33 advised on June 15, 1959, that both the subject
and HENRY SAAVEDRA, who represented subject's interests in the
Hotel Capri, continue to be detained by Cuban police. Source
said it appeared that subject and SAAVEDRA might be deported
from Cuba in the near future.

On June 29, 1959, HAV-33 informed that TRAFFICANTE
was temporarily released from jail on June 21, 1959, in order
to attend his daughter's wedding at the Hotel Havana-Hilton.
Source said that TRAFFICANTE appeared at the hotel in the company
of representatives of the Cuban Ministry of Justice and the
Cuban Secret Police. Source noted that several hundred people
attended the wedding celebration at the Hotel Hilton and that
most of these individuals were persons employed by the gambling
casinos in the Havana area. Source said that Miami Top Hoodlum,
JACKALONE, and Boston Top Hoodlum, JOHN WILLIAMS, were observed
at the wedding celebration.

On July 1, 1959, PCI Arthur Newman (conceal), Credit
Manager of the gambling casino at the Hotel Nacional, advised that
the majority of the persons in attendance at the wedding of
subject's daughter were individuals employed in the gambling
casinos in Havana. Source noted there was only one small group
of persons comprising TRAFFICANTE's immediate family and close
friends in Tampa, who came from the United States to be present
at the wedding. Source noted that most of the hoodlums in the
United States are well aware that police authorities would be
on the look-out for individuals possibly attending the wedding
of TRAFFICANTE's daughter in Havana and for that reason many
hoodlums who might have attended stayed in the United States.

William Julius McLaney. In view of Michael McLaney's reported
interest in 6/15/63 plan to bomb Cuba, he might well have a connection
with this case and may have influenced William McLaney to cooperate
in captioned matter.

Miami also immediately interview Antonio Soto, Evelio
Alpizar, Miguel Alvarez, Sam Benton and Jose de Jesus Basulto Leon
who have been mentioned in previous Miami communications as possibly
being involved in this matter, as well as any other suspects developed
through investigation. Miami also interview Gonzalo Herrera, former
Cuban airlines pilot and other logical former Cuban pilots who may
have been approached to pilot planes in this matter. If not already
done, all suspects connected with the June 15 1963, attempt to bomb
Cuba, which was handled by Customs, should be interviewed.

ADMINISTRATIVE Grand Jury [JFK Law 10(a)2]

The Bureau has been advised that Assistant Attorney
General, Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, Department
of Justice, Miami, WILLIAM KENNEY, while in Tampa on 11/9/62
advised he and the USA EDWARD F. BOARDMAN, MDF, were con-
sidering

Miami Office advised the Bureau by referenced teletype
in the case of JOSEPH ANTHONY INDELICATO, Aka, AR, Miami
file 92-404, that informant information had been received
that JOSEPH INDELICATO and RUBY STRAUSS may operate gambling
ship in the Miami area during the coming winter season.
Panamanian motor vessel, \"Orange Sun\", and German ship
Wappan Von Hamburg\" aka \"Empress of Bahama\", both operating
out of Miami, were considered logical vessels to be used
for this purpose. The Port Director, Miami, advised \"Orange
Sun\" apparently is making regular scheduled runs, but to
be chartered for convention groups.

Miami further advised JOHN CASEBOLT, Immigration
Official, was aboard \"Orange Sun\" at West Palm Beach,
Florida, Nov. 7, 1962, and observed approximately 50 slot
machines covered and locked. He stated it took conven-
tioneers of Florida Automobile Dealers Association from
West Palm Beach to West End and returned during the period
November 4 through 7, 1962.

NW 88614 Docld:32290904 Page 7
- COVER PAGE F - 92-2781-646

TP 92-1
Information was further developed by an informant
aboard \"Wappan Von Hamburg\" during the voyage of November 20,
1962, to Nassau and return, he learned 100 slot machines,
plus faro table and other gambling equipment, to be delivered
to ship within 30 days. Informant states \"the doctor\", or
\"the general\", is to provide this gambling equipment. Identity
of \"the doctor\" closely guarded aboard ship, but informant
was told in confidence \"the doctor\" is \"SANTOS from Tampa,
Florida\".

The Miami Office further advised due to the
possibility that SANTOS was identical with subject, informanto
was instructed to further identify and obtain details regarding
delivery of gambling equipment.

The Houston Office indices were negative regarding
a VICTOR S. GUFFRIS as mentioned in the details of the
report.

Information from the records of the General Telephone
Company of Florida, Tampa, Florida, was made available to

ATTACK ON SPANISH VESSEL \"SIERRA
ARANZAZU,\" 9/13/64
NEUTRALITY MATTERS

Bir Movimiento Recuperacion Revolucionario
Bureau Source Six (Communications Intelligence, classified \"Top
Secret\") has revealed that Spanish Ambassador to U.S. Merry del Val on
9/23/64 reported to his Foreign Ministry that he had visited General
Marshall Carter, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
the previous day and next intended to visit the Director of the FBI. CIA
has provided us a memorandum showing that on 9/22/64 the Ambassador met
with General Carter who referred to assurances given by Secretary of State
Dean Rusk that the U.S. was not involved in the sinking of captioned
vessel.
• Per NSA letter 2/27/98. Milk

Source Six revealed that the Ambassador had a conference with
State Department officials, including Mr. John Crimmins, who is the
Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, on 9/20/64. Following the conference the
Ambassador advised the Spanish Foreign Ministry that he was told by a
State Department official that theinvestigation of the sinking of captioned
Spanish vessel was being carried out principally by the FBI in Miami and
Puerto Rico and that in this connection the State Department official had
an interview with Director of the FBI. In this connection, it may be
noted that Bureau representatives met with Crimmins in his office at
State Department regarding this matter on the morning of 9/20/64 (memo-
randum dated 9/20/64 submitted) and the Ambassador was probably told that
State Department official had met with one of the Director's representa-
tives and not the Director himself. We have no information indicating
the Director has met with State Department official regarding this matter

Our memoranda in captioned matter dated 9/20 and 22/64 show that
at request of Assistant Attorney General Yeagley we are investigating
activities of an anti-Castro organization known as Secret Organization of
Continental Action (OSAC). This investigation was started last July.
Following the sinking of captioned vessel on 9/13/64, the OSAC claimed it
was responsible for the sinking and, thus, we have been investigating
this incident since that time. Crimmins on 9/20/64 advised us the
Spanish Government was most upset over the attack on its vessel and that
the U.S. Government agreed to cooperate in an investigation the Spaniards
are conducting. He asked if Bureau would object to his making available
our investigative results to Spanish officials and we told him that we
interposed no objection to State Department's doing so at its discretion

WRW:ams OCT 15 1964

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan
Re: ATTACK ON SPANISH VESSEL \"SIERRA
ARANZAZU,\" 9/13/64

TOP SECRET

We were subsequently advised by CIA on a very highly confidential
basis (as set out in our 9/22/64 memorandum) that that Agency possessed
information which very definitely indicated that an exile group which is
receiving U.S. backing, known as Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria
(MRR), was responsible for this attack. An error was made in that the
persons carrying out the attack thought they were firing upon a Cuban
vessel. Three Spaniards aboard the Spanish ship were killed as result of
the attack. CIA deals with MRR based upon policy established by a Special
Group, including representatives from CIA, State Department, Defense,
and the White House. Former Attorney General Kennedy also served as a
member of the group. CIA claimed it did not direct any of the MRR opera-
tions and the planned attack which resulted in sinking of the Spanish
vessel was solely an operation engineered by MRR. Details regarding CIA'S
support of this group, of course, are unknown to Spanish authorities,
although State Department is fully aware of complete details regarding this
Incident.

Our investigation in this matter is being pursued on an expedite
and special basis and should be completed within about one week's time
barring unforseen developments. Results are being made available as
received to Crimmins at State Department as well as to Internal Security
Division of Department. In the latter connection, it should be noted if
persons involved in the sinking of captioned vessel undertook any acts
in U.S. in support thereof, they might be in violation of the neutrality
statutes or the conspiracy provisions relating to neutrality violations.
We will request an opinion from Internal Security Division in this regard
when our investigation is completed.

ACTION:

For the Director's information in the event he receives a
request from Spanish Ambassador Merry del Val for an appointment. The
Director may wish to consider taking the position that it would not be
proper for him to see and talk to the Spanish Ambassador because the
subject matter falls in the province of the State Department

Bureau authority is requested to interview subject
in accordance with existing instructions relating to inter-
views of security subjects. If this subject is co-operative,
no affirmative steps will be taken during the initial inter-
view to direct her activities and complete background
investigation required by Section 107C of the Manual of
Instructions is being conducted and Bureau will be requested
to authorize recontact with subject as a PSI. 4

A. Subject resides at Box 208, Route 36, Union
Beach, New Jersey (mailing address is Keyport, N. J.); she
is employed as a cashier at Ye Cottage Inn, Keyport, N. J.
She was born 5/19/61, Newark, N. J., and is a U. S. citizen.
Her health appears to be satisfactory.
NO LOC

B. She was formerly married to WALTER/KORABIAK. Her
probation record notes she is divorced from him and that he
resides in California

C. Subject was convicted in 1958 for conspiracy
and unlawful possession of firearms. Investigation reflects
close association with MANUEL ARQUES and was assisting in
plan to return CARLOS PRIO to power in Cuba. She has
continued association with ARQUES since her conviction.
WS, A

D. No information available. CONFIDENTIAL

E. No information available.

F. A news interview of subject contained in
a local newspaper on 3/26/61 reflects a purported change
in her attitude against CASTRO, whereas at one time she had
favored what CASTRO stood for.

association with persons who have been so involved. X (4)

Bureau note:

Current inquiries of subject are based on report that subject
was prasing Castro in her conversations. Since she has
apparently changed her attitude towards Castro, an interview
of her would be logical method to determine if she possesses
any information of value regarding the Cuban situation and to
appraise, her informant potential.

DETAILS:
On January 24, 1961, NK T-1 advised that several months
previously, while talking to the subject at a bar, she was praising
FIDEL CASTRO and what he was doing for Cuba. Later in the con-
versation, she asked the informant how he felt about making a
\"buck\" or if he cared how he made it. NK T-1, in going along with
the conversation, stated to her that he was interested in making
money, to which she replied that she was expecting a friend from
either Cuba or Miami (not recalled by NK T-1) and that when he
arrived she would have them get together.

Since that time, according to NK T-1, subject has made
no further mention of this matter, although he has seen her on
several occasions. NK T-1 said he had heard it rumored that
the subject has been involved in the sale of guns to Cuba in the
past, as well as having visited Cuba since CASTRO took power, but
did not know this of his own knowledge.

NK T-1 said that ARCHER is divorced from her husband,
has two children and resides with her mother, ANA ARCHER, on
Route 36, Union_Beach, New Jersey. He added that she is employed
as a cashier at Ye Cottage Inn, Keyport, New Jersey.APPROX. 1902

It is to be noted that during the course of another
vestigation the subject's mother, ANNA ARCHER, was interviewed at
her home by SA VICTOR J. CAMPI, on July 6, 1960, concerning an
abandoned car found near her home. Upon requesting a paper upon
which she said she had written the license number of the abandoned
car, Mrs. ARCHER started to enter the next room, at which time a
woman's voice, in a loud tone, objected to an effort to open the
door. Mrs. ARCHER said her daughter was making a phone call and
that when the call was completed she would obtain the requested
item. Shortly thereafter, the subject emerged from the next room
stating she had been interrupted making a very important telephone
call
a call to Cuba. She did not identify the individual to
whom she was talking nor did she furnish any information con-
cerning this telephone conversation.

On October 6, 1960, Captain WALTER HUTTON, Union Beach,
New Jersey, Police Department, advised SA CAMPI that the subject
had two brothers, noting that one brother, FREDDIE ARCHER, was
a well-known_boxer. He noted that the subject had been married
to a local man but had stopped living together in the late 1940s
and since that time her mother, ANNA ARCHER, has been helping to
rear the two children from that marriage. Captain HUTTON did not
know how the subject made her living, but it was his opinion she
probably had boyfriends who kept her, that she did a bit of
traveling with her boyfriends but always returned to visit her
children. He said the subject was also known under the name
RUBY KORBIN.

In the course of another investigation, Alcohol and
Tobacco Tax Division (ATTD) Agent JOHN C. MULLIN, on January 18,
1960, advised SA LINCOLN J. STOKES that the last girlfriend of
CHARLIE \"THE BLADE TOURINE was a girl named EVELYN ARCHER
(phonetic) of Houston, Texas. He said this girl was married and
may be involved in gun purchasing and selling.

on from within the United States against Cuba. The letter con-
tinued that the subject, who had represented herself as Mrs.

\"SHORE WOMAN WHO AIDED CASTRO
SORRY, SAYS CUBANS LIKE US

\" By CHARLES BROWER
Press Staff Writer

\" UNION BEACH -- Despite FIDEL CASTRO's hate America cam-
paign, the average Cuban holds no dislike for Americans.

This is the observation of a local woman who aided, in
what she terms a minor way, the young Cuban dictator's
rise to power over three years ago.

\" Miss EVELYN ARCHER, Rte. 36, who helped supply arms
to Cuban rebels prior to CASTRO's victory over former
Cuban strongman FULGENCIO BATISTA, said she is 'sad and
unhappy' at the results of the Cuban revolution.

\" 'The Cuban people do not hate Americans.'
\" Many Ask About Americans

\" In fact, she said, many Cubans ask if the Americans
really hate them.

\" Miss ARCHER said she was received warmly by Cubans
both in Havana and in the interior during a visit to
the island last fall. 'They treated me wonderfully,'
she said.

\" 'CASTRO has betrayed the people who put him in power.
He has not kept the many promises he made after his
victory early in 1959.'

\" Among the unkept promises made by the bearded dicta-
tor were free elections throughout Cuba within a year.

\" Arrested in Texas

\" 'The Cuban people want to live under a democracy; they
do not want communism,' she asserted. 'CASTRO,' she
said, 'certainly leans toward communism.'

\" Miss ARCHER and five other Cuban rebel sympathizers
were arrested three years ago in Texas as they attempted
to ship arms to rebels in Cuba. She was fined and given
an 18-month suspended jail sentence after pleading no
defense to charges of conspiracy to overthrow the Cuban
government headed by BATISTA.

\" The attractive brunette was also placed on probation
for 22 months and barred from traveling to Cuba during
the probation period.

\" 'I'm not ashamed of what I did. I'm only sorry it has
turned out the way it has,' she said.

\" Asked if she would do it all over again she declared
she would but 'not exactly in the same way.'

11 Minor Role

\" Miss ARCHER became involved in the Cuban revolution
through Cuban friends she had met during visits to
Cuba and Miami. Her part was only a minor one, she
says.

\" She is reluctant to publicly bring up her past asso-
ciations with the Cuban revolution, but agreed only
to convey to Americans the message that the Cuban
people simply have nothing against Americans.

\" 'More and more people are breaking away from the
CASTRO regime each day. They are escaping into the
hills and out of the country by any means possible.
Thousands have been granted political asylum in this
country.'

\" Miss ARCHER said she holds high hopes for the future
liberation of the Cuban people. Although she said
she is not associated now with revolutionary movements
and knows of no specific plans to overthrow CASTRO she
added it is readily known that such movements are
active.

\" 'Many of the groups have been organizing in Miami,'
she said.

\" Friends she had been associated with in aiding the
revolution have all defected from Cuba since her visit
last fall. It is for this reason, she said, she would
not dare return to Cuba as long as CASTRO is in power.

\" 'Crazy With Power'

\" When asked why CASTRO has failed to keep his promises
and to bring freedom to Cuba, Miss ARCHER replied that
'he has perhaps gone crazy with power.'

entitled \"MURRAY L. HUMPHREYS aka; ANTI-RACKETEERING\".

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the above information, witch does
not appear that the subject fits within the criterian
of the ALEM Program. It is to be noted that the subject
was in the US for a considerable amount of time before he
married an American citizen and had been granted Permanent
Residence on a Non-Immigrant status prior to his marriage to
CYNTHIA HAAS.

Although the subject did enter the US with the
profession of a photographer and had employment with Magnum
Photos, Inc. upon his entry, thite does not appear that his
services were solicited by this company because of a special
skill.

In view of the above, it is the opinion of the
NYO that further investigation of the above is not warranted
and this case is being placed in a closed status.

Memorandum

TO : DIRECTOR, FBI DATE: AUG_9 1963
FROM : SAC, NEW YORK (105-62202) (RUC) ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED EXCEPT
WHERE SHOWN OTHERWISE.
SUBJECT: EDUARDO PEREZ GONZALEZ
IS CUBA
(00:MIAMI)

Re Bureau letter dated 6/25/63.

In accordance with referenced letter,
the following informants, all of whom are familiar
with various phases of anti-CASTRO activity in
the NY area, were contacted and advised that the
subject was unknown to them:

Informant Date Contacting Agent

CSNY 2623-S 7/10/63 SA FRANCIS J. O'BRIEN
CSNY 2822-S 7/24/63 SA FRANCIS J. O'BRIEN
JESUS DE LOS 7/8/63 SA FRANCIS J. O'BRIEN
HEROS

Source DE LOS HEROS is the husband of BERTA
BARRETO, 340 East 80th St., NYC, who has in the past
acted as a Cuban contact of attorney JAMES DONOVAN in
his negotiations for the release of various Cuban
prisoners. DE LOS HEROS advised that in April, 1963,
one DAN CHAPPEL was released from a Cuban prison.
CHAPPEL is reputed to be a cattle breeder in the Miami,
Florida area and was alleged to be a politician in
some way in that area. In 1960 and 1961, CHAPPEL was
engaged in gambling enterprises in Cuba and reportedly

NY 105-62202
lost a great deal of money in this venture, which
money had been given to him for use in the gambling
venture in Cuba by an unknown syndicate of individuals
in the United States. CHAPPEL is the only individual
that DE LOS HEROS felt might fit the description
of the American citizen formerly in a Cuban prison
who was financing raids on Cuba and who was a friend
of the subject.

NY sources familiar with anti-CASTRO
activity in the NY area, although advising that the
subject was unknown to them, stated that from time
to time they would make appropriate discreet inquiries
through other sources of theirs in the anti-CASTRO field
in the United States in order to determine the subject's
identity and that if any information of value along
these lines is developed, they will immediately notify
the NYO.

A review of the files of the NYO reflects
no information identifiable with the subject; however,
it was noted in NY file 105-55031-164 that a letterhead
memorandum dated 3/25/63, at Miami, Florida, captioned
\"HAITIAN REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES; IS-HAITI\", on pages
3, 6 and 7, contain information relative to one ALBERTO
BAYO, aka Captain Bayo, who was formerly connected
with Alpha 66 and whose identity inreality is EDUARDO
PEREZ, residing 351 Southwest 6th St., Apartment 2,
Miami, Florida. On page 13 of this letterhead memorandum
PEREZ is described as a Cuban exile who was very
talkative, unpredictable and undependable.

INSURGENT GROUP APPARENTLY ACTIVE IN
CUBA

An insurgent group known as the Cuban Revolutionary
Junta is apparently active inside Cuba according to clandestine
radio sources.

A broadcast on Monday morning, 30 August, from the
clandestine radiostation, \"the Voice of the New Cuba,\" which
is apparently a part of the Cuban exile group, \"Accion Sindical
Independiente\" Independent Labor Action - ASI], the official
organ of the National Revolutionary Anti-Communist Front,
appealed to the Cuban people to try, in any way possible, to
get in touch with a member of the Cuban Revolutionary Junta.

Previously, this radio station transmitted instructions
to members of unidentified insurgent groups((A)).

It has already been reported to the Bureau that
ROSSELLI deposited this $25,000.00 check to his account at
the Fidelity Bank, Beverly Hills, California, on 7/11/63.

IRS [JFK Law 11(a)]

On 9/20/63, Los Angeles Police Department advised
that recently one of their officers called the last known
telephone number they had for ROSSELLI. This number was
OL 4-7164. ROSSELLI has not had this number since March,
1961. The officer asked for ROSSELLI and the woman who
answered said ROSSELLI was not there but would be in later.
The woman then told the officer that Mr. NESSER was in and
could probably help the caller (LAPD Officer). The officer
declined to talk to NESSER. The Los Angeles Police Department
ascertained that telephone number OL 4-7164 is currently listed
to Home Savings and Loan Association. IRS, Los Angeles, who
had also received this information from the Los Angeles Police
Department ascertained that OL 4-7164 is answered by Lauria's Tele-
phone Answering Service for GORDON NESSER, an employee of Home
Savings and Loan. IRS also found that during the past two
months, ROSSELLI has received several calls in c/ NESSER
at telephone number OL 4-7164. IRS has already made arrange-
ments for interview of NESSER regarding his relationship
with ROSSELLI, and specifically as to whether or not ROSSELLI
has invested money in some real estate venture.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

EXCEPT WHERE SHOWN
OTHERWISE

Reference is made to memorandum dated 7/24/75,
captioned as above, which requested review, assessment and
recommendations pertaining to the contents of pages extracted
from a 693-page CIA document in order to fully identify the
subject matter and to assess whether FBI operations were
compromised.

Section CI-3 conducted the following review and
makes the assessment pertinent thereto:

RE: Page 00026, \"Siesta\" and pages 00059-61, captioned
\"Subject: General: Office of Security Survey.\" (5)

This matter concerns Orlando Nunez-Toro
(Bufile 105-141367), a United States citizen of Cuban
extraction, who was suspected by CIA of attempting to
recruit for intelligence purposes CIA personnel, one
Miss Deborah Fitzgerald. By letter dated 8/4/70, the
first communication to the FBI by CIA relating to Toro-
Nunez and Fitzgerald, the FBI was requested to advise
whether it interposed any objections to CIA investigative
action CIA deemed necessary to explore questions raised
by the association of Nunez Toro and Fitzgerald with CIA
employees.(5)
EX-101 REC-56

In response to that inquiry, FBIHQ advised CIA
by letter dated 8/14/70, that the FBI interposed no objection
to CIA investigation for such a purpose. At the same time,
CIA was specifically requested to provide the FBI with any
information developed relating to FBI internal security
responsibilities.(5)

Memo to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

CIA communicated with FBIHQ by letters dated
7/6/71 and 2/24/72, concerning the Nunez-Toro and
Deborah Fitzgerald matter, requesting each time records
review of Bureau files of numerous individuals of interest
to CIA. On each occasion CIA was provided with the results
of such checks. However, by letter dated 3/2/72, FBIHQ
responded to CIA letter dated 2/24/72, by stating, \"We have
made a study of our file concerning this matter (Nunez-Toro
and Fitzgerald) and a detailed review of the referenced
material. At the present time, it appears the paramount
concern is whether Nunez and Deborah Jane Fitzgerald are
obtaining intelligence information concerning your Agency,
and you have established a network of sources to cover that
aspect. As you indicate, there is no specific evidence
that Nunez or Fitzgerald has any connection with a hostile
intelligence service or a foreign government. We, therefore,
will defer to your Agency until completion of your investigation
or the development of information showing they are engaged
in subversive activities within our primary jurisdiction.\"
(5)

The FBI did not conduct an internal security-type
investigation regarding the relationship of Nunez-Toro and
Fitzgerald. The FBI did conduct an internal security-type
investigation of Nunez-Toro in 1965 as a result of his
reported disaffection for the United States while living
abroad. We reopened that investigation in 1969 when it was
reported that Nunez-Toro communicated with the Cuban Embassy,
Ottawa, Canada. That investigation was closed when it was
established his family desired to return to Cuba and his
contact was in that regard.7(5)
revealed
A review of FBIHQ files contain no information
that any FBI employee was knowledgeable, before or after
the fact, of a surreptitious entry on the part of CIA
personnel, into the premises of Nunez-Toro and Deborah
Fitzgerald. That surreptitious entry by CIA personnel into
the premises of Nunez-Toro and Fitzgerald located in
Fairfax, Virginia, received considerable publicity recently,
when it was alleged that Fairfax police assisted the CIA
during the entry. (5)

ASSESSMENT:

No compromise of an on-going FBI operation.

Memo to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

RE: Page 00026, \"Paragon.\" (s)

✓ This matter pertains to an alleged plot in
1972-73 to assassinate former Vice President Spiro Agnew
and the Director of CIA by using two Latin American
revolutionaries. A CIA informant abroad reported that
one Elizabeth Boynton Millard, a New York City resident
known for her Communist associations and her involvement
with Latin-American revolutionaries, was scheduled \"to
finger\" top United States Officials for assassination.
The plot was allegedly conceived some time prior to 8/19/72,
in Chile and was to be carried out sometime between 10/25/72
through 11/7/72. The FBI investigated this plot thoroughly (5)
and closed its investigation on 2/2/73, when it was
concluded that none of the individuals reportedly involved
had any connection with such activity.

ASSESSMENT:

No compromise of an on-going FBI operation.

RE: Page 00282, \"28 October 1970.\"
(5)

During October, 1970, United States Government
officials, including Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, who was then
assigned to The White House, received cryptograms indicating
bombings would occur in various cities of the United States
on 11/29/70. The Soviet Military Attache, Washington, D. C.,
received a similar cryptogram reporting United States
Chinese activities against Russia. The sender of the
cryptograms was identified and during our investigation
other government agencies, including CIA, were requested
to furnish the original cryptograms for fingerprint examination.

ASSESSMENT:

No compromise.

RE: Pages 00290, 00292, 00295, 00310.

The contents of these pages concern the Daniel
Ellsberg matter, all of which is of a public nature.

ASSESSMENT:

No compromise.

RE: Pages 00334, 00361–363, 00368, 00371, 00373, 00376-379,
00384, 00385, 00468-470 and 00615.

The contents of these pages concern the \"Chilean
Project.\" On 4/16/71, CIA proposed technical penetration
of the Chilean Embassy, Washington, D. C., to collect foreign
intelligence data and to compromise classified encrypted
diplomatic traffic. CIA proposed that access be made
through one of their covert contacts. The FBI declined.
The Attorney General then requested FBI cooperation. On
5/13/71, a memorandum was sent to the Department of State
for approval of that operation and such approval was obtained
on 5/17/71. On 7/14/71, the Attorney General authorized
activation of the microphone installation at the Chilean
Embassy until 10/8/71. CIA requested continuation as the
expiration date approached and on 10/15/71, the Attorney
General authorized such continuation. The technical
surveillance was discontinued as noted in memorandum to
the Attorney General and CIA dated 2/7/72. The surveillance
was reactivated on 12/27/72, and was eventually discontinued
on 2/22/73.(S)

On 6/19/73, the Watergate Special Prosecution Force
requested FBI investigation of the alleged burglary of the
Chilean Embassy, Washington, D. C., on or about 5/13/72.
The Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, D. C.,
conducted an investigation of that incident and submitted
a complete report to the Office of the United States Attorney.
That report was in the possession of the Watergate Special
Prosecution Force and on 10/30/73, that Force advised the
FBI that no additional investigation was desired. There
is no connection between the \"Chilean Project\" and the
alleged burglary of the Chilean Embassy on or about 5/13/72.(5)

Re: Senstudy 75

ASSESSMENT:

The above information refers to our special
coverage of the Chilean Embassy which was discontinued
in February, 1973, and has not been operational since that
time. Possession of such information by the Senate Committee 15
will not interfere with any on-going FBI investigation.
All activities engaged in by the FBI in connection with
this project were conducted on the instruction of Attorney
General Mitchell.
(5)

RE: Page 00361, captioned \"Memorandum for: Executive Secretary,
CIA Management Committee.

In addition to the \"Chilean Project,\" the contents
of this page also refer to FBI technical coverage of diplomatic
establishments of Israel. It is pointed out that Watergate
Defendant James McCord telephoned the Embassy of Israel,
Washington, D. C., after his arrest, believing that his
conversation would be overheard and he would be able to
challenge tainted evidence. The date of his telephone call
to the Embassy of Israel is not known but it is pointed out
that our technical coverage of the Embassy of Israel was
discontinued on 10/16/72, at the specific request of Secretary
of State William Rogers. This matter is also public knowledge.

ASSESSMENT:

No compromise of FBI operations.

RE: Pages 00457 and 00458, concerning Item Number 3.

According to CIA, this matter involved surreptitious
entries by CIA into a French diplomatic establishment,
Washington, D. C., during the early 1960's. As is evident
from reading Item number 3, there is no FBI involvement in
or knowledge of such activities by CIA.

Memo to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75

It is pointed out that Philippe Thyraud De Vosjoli
(Bufile 64-33606) a former attache of the French Embassy,
Washington, D. C., and a former French Intelligence officer,
cooperated with CIA and provided CIA with information in
1963 that French intelligence planned to engage in intelligence
activities in the United States. This information was
thereafter transmitted to the FBI. It is believed that
De Vosjoli is identical with either Iden-122 or Iden-124
mentioned in Item number 3.
3.(5)

ASSESSMENT:

There is no compromise of an on-going FBI operation.

RE: Pages 00591-00593, captioned) \"MHCHAOS Program.\" \"(5)

This CIA program involved the clandestine
collection abroad of information relating to foreign
efforts to support and influence domestic United States
extremism. The foreign-oriented activity in the
United States was of two types; first, selected FBI
informants who traveled abroad in connection with their
extremist activity and their resultant debriefing by CIA
with the cooperation of the FBI. Second, FBI sources with
existing extremist credentials who were offered to CIA
for dispatching abroad to collect information responsive
to CIA requirements. (s)

There has been no compromise of such FBI informants
and sources.

ASSESSMENT:

ACTION:

No compromise of any on-going FBI operation.

For information and referral to Senstudy Group.

On 7/25/75 at the request of Special
Intelligence Coordinator Michael Shaheen in the Department,
a meeting was held between representatives of the FBI (SAS
Paul B Daly and John Thomas), representatives of the Senate
Select Committee (John T. Elliff, Task Force head of the Domestic
Task Force, Mark Gitenstein) and Michael Shaheen of the Department.
At this meeting Mr. Shaheen advised that the proposed procedures
concerning the handlings of requests for documents by the Senate
Select Committee had been approved by the Attorney General and in
the Senate Select Committee. (A copy is attached.)

Shaheen and Elliff indicated the purpose in meeting on
the 25th along with an anticipated meeting on Monday, 7/28/75, was
to assist the SSC in the planning of a superseding request in
accordance with the newly established procedures concerning
document requests. Both Shaheen and Elliff expressed concern at
this time that the schedules set forth in the new agreement was
such that in many instances the Bureau would not be able to
respond in time to meet the deadlines. Additionally, Shaheen
expressed concern that the provisions require that the Attorney
General adjudicate any question as to the necessity of furnishing
a document to the Committee and to make such a decision within 24
hours would be very burdensome.

Messrs. Elliff and Shaheen were advised by SA Daly that
this would be true, pointing out that in many instances files are
not readily available because of FOIA requests, needs of the
Bureau's ongoing investigations and law suits in which it was
necessary to view particular files. It was also pointed out that
many of the requests of the Senate Select Committee necessitate
the review of a number of files and/or numerous. volumes of a
particular file all of which are not necessarily available
immediately. Mr. Shaheen advised that it was the Attorney
General's desire that Senate Select Committee requests take
precedence over all other matters including the Freedom of In-
formation. It was pointed out to Mr. Shaheen that our responses
to Freedom of Information Act are under deadline by law and; if

Legal Counsel to J. B. Adams Memorandum
RE: SENSTUDY 1975

this were to be the Attorney General's feelings, he should
advise this Bureau in writing so that we would be in a
position to use this statement of policy should this
question arise during litigation. It was pointed out that
in many areas of possible abuse set forth by the Senate
Select Committee we have pending FOIA requests and/or
litigation which require the availability of those files
for responses.

Elliff indicated that it was the Committee's desire
in their forthcoming superseding request to request material
that had been previously furnished the Committee with the under-
standing that there would be less excisions made in compliance
with the new agreement. He inquired as to whether the Bureau
could advise him as to what material previously furnished was
readily retrievable and could be furnished in accordance with
a new request. He was advised by SAs Daly and Thomas that it was
not possible at this time to give him a response, however, we would
endeavor to make an analysis of prior requests to obtain this in-
formation and have it available for the meeting Monday, 7/28/75.

A general discussion was had concerning the new agree-
ment especially concerning the type of material which might
properly be excised and third agency problems. It was generally
agreed upon that not only the identity of informants be excised
but also information which might disclose the identity of infor-
mants might also be properly excised. Elliff indicated that the
Committee did not wish to see many items referred to the Attorney
General as is called for by the agreement for his decision and
would rather at least on a preliminary basis where it was a
question of the propriety of the excision that the discussion
be held with he or one of his representatives before such a
referral was made. Shaheen also indicated a desire that the
referrals to the Attorney General be kept to a minimum. Regard-
ing the \"Third Agency\" problems which are not addressed in the
agreement there was no final decision arrived at. Elliff and
Shaheen were under the impression that the clauses referring
to foreign intelligence operations or foreign intelligence
sources would handle this problem. They were advised that
this was not the case. This was not true since even in
these instances Senators on the Committee are given access
after the Attorney General has made a determination that
material involved \"pecularily sensitive foreign intelli-

intelligence operations.\" It was pointed out that this
would require that many documents be referred to the
Attorney General for his determination which would be
contrary to Messrs. Elliff's and Shaheen's desires.

The meeting was held 7/28/75, Messrs. Gitenstein and
Elliff of the Committee, Michael Shaheen and Steven K.. Blackhurst
of the Department, and SAs Paul V. Daly, Seymor Phillips and Elmer
Larson were in attendance. Regarding the \"Third Agency\" rule
problem, we advised the Department and the Committee that we
would continue to abide by this rule. The Committee presented
a request dated July 28, 1975, captioned \"Superseding Request
for FBI Materials.\" This document amounted to a recapitulation
of prior requests made by the Committee with a schedule for
delivery set forth in accordance with the established guidelines
for the production of documents. An item-by-item analysis of the
request contained in the document was had and where necessary
modifications concerning scheduled responses was made. It was
obvious the intent of the Committee in making the superseding
request was to have more documents made available in the Commit-
tee offices and also to have less excisions made on documents.
previously furnished the Committee based on prior requests.
were requested by Shaheen to prepare as soon as possible cor-
respondence to the Attorney General setting forth instances where
the deadlines set by the Committee could not be made. This prompted
the provisions in the guidelines for the production duction of documents
which require the Attorney General to notify the Committee Chair-
man and Vice Chairman within 24 hours of any expected delay beyond
96 hours of the request.

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

Reference is made to W. O. Cregar to Mr. W. R.
Wannall memorandum dated 7/24/75, captioned as above. This
memorandum advised CIA had prepared a document citing instances
wherein CIA believed some of its activities may have exceeded
its legal mandate. Portions of this CIA document were
furnished this Bureau and referenced memorandum requested
documents pertaining to a particular Bureau division and/or
Intelligence Division section be reviewed to identify the
subject matter and make an assessment as to whether any
compromise to this Bureau's operation is involved. Those
portions of the CIA document pertaining to the IS-2 Section
of the Intelligence Division are pages 29, 30, 171, 190,
191, 193, 194, 197, 198, 203, 330, and 482.

A review has been made of the material, supra, and
the following comments apply:

Pages 29, 30, under the heading \"Merrimac,\" refer
to recruitment and handling of \"several Agents\" to covertly
monitor dissident groups in the Washington area and states
one was so successful the \"Agent\" was turned over to the FBI.
We have no idea who the \"Agent\" was and in absence of identi-
fying information no compromise exists to Bureau operations.
REC-102 document Citrea 499
Page 171 refers to CIA producing a document titled
Titled
\"Restless Youth\" in two versions. The version dealing with
radical students in America was sent only to the President
and two other high officials. Page 171, itself, in no way...
compromises Bureau operations.

14 AUG 11 1975
Pages 190, 191, also deal with the \"Restless Youth\"
document, which disclose the document only went tomine
freaders, \"a copy may be in the Johnson Library,\" and refers
to updating of the document. These pages, themselves, in no
way compromise Bureau operations.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Pages 193, 194, refer to CIA participation in prepara-
tion of several short intelligence memoranda dealing with the
foreign connections of U. S. organizations and activists
involved in the anti-war movement. Reference is made to..
collecting information from their own sources \"and through
liaison with the FBI.\" A reference is also made to primary
source of information being \"sensitive intercepts produced
by NSA.\" While these pages do not directly compromise
Bureau operations, disclosure of NSA intercepts could well
indirectly adversely affect Bureau operations by disclosure
of sensitive techniques which . produce extremely valuable
information to the intelligence community, of which the FBI
is a part.

Pages 197, 198, refer to the response to an inquiry
as to involvement in domestic affairs by the Director, Central
Reference Service, CIA, and in no way compromises Bureau
operations.

Page 203 refers to a similar response by Director,
Foreign Broadcast Information Service, CIA, and includes a
reference to their monitoring foreign broadcasts of Jane
Fonda and Ramsey Clark and furnishing transcripts at the
request of the FBI and Department of Justice for consideration
for possible trial use. There is no compromise of Bureau
operations involved as this was to be evidence in a public
trial and would have required CIA personnel to publicly
testify.

Page 330 again makes reference to \"Restless Youth\"
and use of FBI reports. It also refers to a 1967 CIA study
of \"SDS and its foreign ties.\" The page, itself, does not
compromise Bureau operations.

Page 482 refers to a \"project MPLODESTAR,\" which
involved manipulation of assets against targets in the
\"leftist and communist milieu in various parts of the world.\"
Comments include \"each case is cleared with the FBI...\" The
page itself does not compromise Bureau operations.

RE: SENSTUDY
TOP SECRE

The following are comments prepared by the Radio
Engineering Section of the FBI Laboratory and relate to copies of
excerpted pages from a report written by the Central Intelligence
Agency. Comments are keyed to page numbers which appear in
the lower right-hand corner of each sheet.

1. Page 00112

Paragraph b. refers to FBI purchases of television
equipment and is accurate as to equipment obtained. According to
Bureau records, Purchase Order #21100 was issued to CIA on
4/11/73 and was amended 9/24/73. The items were 1 each WTC-20
@$18, 300 and 1 each WTC-23 @ $18,600. Purchase Order #21469
dated 5/1/73 was issued to CIA for 2 each lens systems totaling $11, 200.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

2. Page 00118

Item 9 lists 50 \"Actuators, Recorders.\" This entry is
partially correct.

Bureau records show that Purchase Order #8989 was
issued to CIA on 11/17/71 for 30 each QTC-lls at $488.25, and 20 each
QTC-12As at $236.25.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

Item 11 lists 1 \"Camera, Video.\" This entry could refer to
that transaction detailed in Purchase Order #18301 issued to CIA on
11/27/72 for 1 each WTC-20 camera in the amount of $18, 400. Tubes
installed in these cameras were of the type mentioned under Item 12
and 13 below.

Item 12 lists 1 \"Tube, Image, Burn-Resistance, Equivalent
of WL 30691.\" This entry is accurate.

TOP SECRET

Purchase Order #16555 was issued to CIA on 9/21/72 in the
amount of $4,639. The video tube was for use in a closed circuit
television camera.

Item 13 lists 2 \"Tube, Image, WL 30691\" as having been
furnished the FBI on 3/26/71 at a cost of $4,607 each. This entry
is probably a duplication of Item 4 on page 00119. Bureau records
show that Purchase Order #5450 dated 5/21/71 was issued to CIA
for this equipment for use in CCTV cameras. No purchase order
to support two such acquisitions (March and May) could be located.

Item 14 lists 2 \"Cameras, Television\" at a unit cost of
$18,300. This entry probably refers to that equipment acquired under
Purchase Order #21100 and is detailed in Paragraph b. page 00112, above.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

3. Page 00119

Item 2 lists 25 \"Actuators, Recorders.\" The entry is
accurate.

Purchase Order #17204 was issued to CIA on 10/18/72 for 25
each QTC-lls @ $591.94. This equipment is identical to that obtained on
Purchase Order #8989 mentioned above.

Item 3 lists \"Tube, Image, Burn-Resistance\" etc., and is a
duplication of Item 12 on page 00118. Note identical dates.

Item 4 lists \"Tube, Image, WL 30691\" and is believed to refer
to the transaction carried as Item 13 on page 00118.

Items 5, 6, and 7 list \"Transmitters, Module, Plug-In,
and Power Supply - UWP-39A.\" These entries are essentially accurate.

Purchase Order #4203 was issued to CIA on 4/6/71 for
2 each transmitters SRT-67 @ $1372.35; 1 each transmitter QRT-10A
@3160.33; 1 each module QWT-18 @ $1247.40; and, 1 each power
supply UWP-39A @ $538.65.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

Item (A) is believed to be accurate and in the absence of
additional detail no serious damage would be suffered by release of
this information.

Item (B) is accurate and as long as target is not specifically
identified no serious damage should be incurred. It should be recognized,
however, that although the concept of intercepting cryptographic
machine emanations would come as no surprise to those familiar with
intelligence work, confirmation of a functioning system could encourage
implementation of countermeasures which would deprive the U.S. of
invaluable information.

Item (C) is accurate except that the equipment has not been
operated for some time. Without specific identification no serious
damage would result from disclosure of this information.

Item (D) is inaccurate to the extent that it states that
\"installation is not fully operational because the full complement
of personnel have not yet arrived.\" Aside from that, disclosure
of information could lead the knowledgeable foreign government to be
certain of Bureau's participation and take whatever diplomatic steps
they felt necessary. Decision to withhold is an operational/political
one rather than one which would affect technical capabilities and, therefore,
the Laboratory is making no recommendations in this regard.

5. Page 00222

Item (E) is accurate and entirely too revealing. If there
is any way this item can be deleted from material yet to be given to
anyone outside the intelligence community, it should be done. As
written, it suggests a concerted effort toward a penetration to be
attempted in the future. Disclosure of this information could easily
negate millions of dollars already spent and literally years of work
already performed - the largest single project ever undertaken by
this Bureau. In view of our responsibilities in the counter-intelligence
field, the FBI, as well as the intelligence community, and perhaps the
free world as well, would suffer incalculable harm from release of this
information. It would also be appropriate for the Intelligence Division
to comment on this item.

Item (F) is accurate and, although its disclosure is
confirmatory no serious technical damage would result from its
disclosure. To our knowledge, there has been no diplomatic
protest, disclosure could precipitate such protest. Intelligence
Division may wish to comment regarding this possibility.

Item (G) asserts that in one case it is known that CIA
equipment was used against a \"domestic target. \" This is insufficient
information to identify this matter.

ARABIC LINGUISTS
(Item 6, pgs. 182 & 202)

With regard to press allegations concerning the use
of polygraph, it was noted that during July 1971 the President
was alleged to be furious with unauthorized disclosure of
classified information relative to the SALT Talks as disclosed
in the New York Times. The President directed a sweeping
investigation to determine the source of the disclosure and
this was conducted under the direction of Mr. Egil Krogh and
others of the White House Staff.

A subsequent article in the Washington Post dated
September 3, 1971 stated that a State Department spokesman
had acknowledged at a news briefing that agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation had polygraphed State Department
employees suspected of leaking information on the SALT Talks
in July. This statement is not accurate and the Director of
the FBI (J. Edgar Hoover) denied this allegation in a letter
to the Washington Post and said that the polygraph examinations
had been conducted by another agency.

As noted in the CIA notes in fact, it was CIA that
conducted the polygraph examination in conjunction with the
State Department and the FBI was not involved in any way in
these polygraph examinations. It is recalled that FBI
officials had been called to a White House meeting headed
by Mr. Krogh in which it was indicated we might have to
conduct some polygraph examinations and were so alerted.
subsequent call from the White House to the FBI instructed
that the FBI polygraph examinations would not be required.

A
In view of above, it does not appear the FBI would
incur any damage to its reputation or recognized use of the
polygraph in carefully selected criminal and security matters
in which we have jurisdiction.

POLYGRAPH
(Item 7, pgs 65-67)

In regard to the CIA notes concerning the subject
of the lending of Arabic linguists to the FBI, the following
is noted:

The FBI's linguistic capacity is limited to those
foreign languages in which translators can be fully utilized
on a full-time basis. When we need translations of foreign
language material beyond our normal translation capacity,
we turn to the governmental linguistic community for
assistance. Such help has been obtained in the past from
such agencies as the Library of Congress, Voice of America,
Foreign Service Institute, Defense Language Institute,
CIA, NSA, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U. S. Information
Agency and Smithsonian Institution. On occasions, we
have also turned to private citizens for help in very
unique situations involving exotic or rare languages.

The massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich
at the 1972 Summer Olympics and other Arab terrorist
acts fomented a situation involving the national security
of the United States. The FBI needed immediate assistance
in the Arabic language field. A program was immediately
instituted to hire our own Arabic translators and, in the
interim period, CIA lent to our Washington Field Office the
necessary Arabic translators to fulfill our responsibilities.

The opening of the People's Republic of China
Liaison Office in Washington also created a need in the
Washington Field Office for Chinese translators with
special talents. Two such translators were borrowed from
CIA and one of them became an FBI employee for a short
time following his retirement from CIA.

All arrangements for the loan of Arabic and Chinese
linguists from CIA were effected by the Intelligence Division and
the Washington Field Office through their liaison with CIA, and
the FBI Laboratory was not directly involved.

In summary, the CIA notes are accurate. It is
not believed, however, that the FBI would incur any
embarrassment or damages as a result of this interagency
cooperation.

Current personnel are unable to verify or

In all likelihood, this contact was made in

This consultation was entirely proper and made

PURCHASE OF CAMERAS

(Item 8, Pg. 00118)

The F. B. I., by purchase order #1793
dated 1/20/72, contracted for the purchase of 10 Tessina
cameras on a transfer of funds basis arranged as a result
of our liaison with the Technical Services Division of CIA.
Cost of these cameras amounted to $7,000.

The Tessina camera is a small, sophisticated
camera which is employed in concealment devices needed
for photographic surveillances.

Although the exact nature of the concealment
devices we employ is not publicized, the disclosure of the
fact that we purchased cameras suitable for this use is not
considered inimical to our operations.

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of
the Intelligence Community, (hereafter referred to as the
Group), held on 3/7/75.

The Group is chaired by Mr. John Clarke, Associate
Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence, and is made
up of representatives of agencies and departments having
membership on the United States Intelligence Board (USIB).
Its purpose is to serve as a coordinating mechanism for future
testimony before various Congressional committees..

At the meeting of the Group on 3/7/75 the following
items were discussed:

Congressman Robert McClory has been designated as
the minority leader of the House Select Committee. Copies of
the annexes prepared by various members of the Intelligence
Community have been delivered to both the majority and minority
leader of the House Select Committee. Congressman McClory. is
very security conscious, is concerned that sensitive relation-
ships are not inadvertently disclosed during forthcoming hearings
and according to Mr. John Clarke appears to have no questions
regarding FBI authority to engage in domestic surveillances.
CIA has prepared a draft letter to Senator Church releasing
CIA employees from any obligations imposed upon them by CIA's
Secrecy Agreement (draft copy furnished the Legal Counsel
Division). Prior to releasing the letter to Senator Church,
CIA is having it reviewed by the White White House to determine if
they have any objections to its content..
2-116:15-50
REC-37

CIA anticipates that staff employees of the Senate
Select Committee (SSC), will have direct access to CIA buildings
but will not have direct access to CIA files or CIA parsome7.1975
Arrangements for the staff of the SSC to interview CIA personnel
will be made through Mr. John Clarke.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
CONFIDEIAT

Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Deputy Attorney
General, and Mr. John Warner, General Counsel, CIA, will
have a meeting with the Counsel of the SSC on Tuesday,
3/11/75, to work out precise wording for a Secrecy Agreement
that all members of the SSC staff have agreed to sign.

On 3/10/75 the staff of the SSC will convene to
develop a list of requirements that they expect to levy on
all agencies making up the Intelligence Community. Hopefully
Mr. Clarke will have some information on these requirements
prior to the time they are levied on the individual agencies.

As a result of Mr. Colby's appearance before the
House Government Information in Individual Rights Subcommittee,
Government Operations Committee, 3/5/75, CIA is getting many,
many, calls from Senators and Congressmen asking how they can
find out whether CIA has a file on them and what its contents
are. Mr. Clarke noted that members of the Group should
anticipate receiving similar calls from Congressmen.

Mr. Hank Knocke, who heads up the CIA task force
responsive to the Rockefeller Commission, advised that staff
members of the Rockefeller Commission have been issued CIA
badges, occupy CIA office space, and have authority to
personally contact any CIA employee without clearing such
contact with CIA officials. In addition, the Rockefeller
Commission staff employees have been granted access to CIA
files. After reviewing these files, if the staff decides to
make certain portions of the files a matter of official
Commission business, CIA has a right to excise the names of
any sensitive sources. In the event information contained in
these files originates with another Agency of the Government
CIA has insisted and the staff concurs that the originating
Agency must be consulted before such information can be
released to the staff.
(0)

Mr. Knocke also advised that it is his understanding
that both Mr. Kelley and Mr. Colby will receive in the mail
shortly a request from the Commission to prepare a joint
response covering the activities of foreign intelligence officials
in the U. S.

CIA as well as the rest of the Intelligence
Community is concerned over requests received by Morton
Halperin under the Freedom of Information Act. Treasury,
National Security Council, Defense Intelligence Agency,
CIA, State Department and the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), have received requests from Halperin.
According to Mr. Clarke, a meeting will be convened by the
OMB involving interested parties in an effort to coordinate
a response. Mr. Colby, in his role as the Director of
Central Intelligence, is very concerned that in responding
to Halperin's requests one Agency does not deny providing
information to Halperin that another Agency expects to give
Halperin. To date the Bureau has not received a request
from Halperin under the Freedom of Information Act. 10 (0)

INQUIRY BY GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE (GAO) AND
THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET (OMB)
CONCERNINGVINTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

APPROPRIATIONS- 1974.
On the afternoon of March 7, 1975, Mr. James F. Hoobler,
Director, Management Programs and Budget Staff, furnished a copy of a
memorandum from GAO to the Deputy Director of the OMB which requested
information concerning appropriations, outlays and legislative authority
for such appropriations and expenditures.

S
With regard to the FBI's Intelligence Division, a response
was requested concerning the amounts of budget authority for fiscal years
1974 and 1975 and actual outlays for fiscal year 1974; an indication of where
in the Foderal budget these amounts or any portion of them appear; any
language in the budget which explains or indicates the purpose or purposes
for which sich amounts will be spent; and the legislative authority for each,
of the listed appropriations and expenditures.

Original Filed it 66-19125-94

The FDI does not receive budget authority or account for
budget outlaye specifically for internal security or intolligence activitios or
for any organizational component handling sich matters. The FBI's budget
request for funds to handle internal security or intelligence matters is set
forth under the budget activity \"fccurity and Criminal Investigations.\"
Based cu manpower utilisation surveys which have been condicted, it is
estimated that approximately 23 percent of the FBI's remorrces go to support
activities under the supervision of the Intelligence Division. It is estimated,
therefore, that in the fiscal year 1974 the FBI's budget authority containod
fanis amounting to some 501 millics and that it had outlays of about $33 million

Mr. Paul. II. O'Neill
Deputy Director
Office of Management and Budget

Dear Mr. O'Neill:

We have recently received a request from a Member of the Senate
Budget Committee for our assistance in obtaining budget data with
respect to various intelligence activities of the Federal Government.
We have the budget data that is publicly available. However, as you are:
aware, most of the requested information is not readily available and
is usually provided to the Congress in limited briefings. We have
discussed this matter with representatives of the Senate Budget Committee.
and it is their desire to obtain the requested data by other than oral
briefings.

The request involves amounts of budget authority for fiscal years
1974 and 1975 by each of the following agencies, and the actual outlays
by each such agency during FY 1974.

1. Central Intelligence Agency

2. National Security Agency

3. Defense Intelligence Agency

4. Army Intelligence

5. Naval Intelligence

6. Air Force Intelligence (including the National
Reconnaissance Office)

of the above-mentioned amounts appear? Indicate to
the closest possible degree of specificity, designating
such amounts by the accounts or line items, or combina-
tions of accounts or line items, under which the
amounts are included, and any language in the budget
which explains or indicates the purpose or purposes
for which such amounts will be spent.

\"What is the legislative authority for each of the
above-listed appropriations and expenditures?\"

We would appreciate your reviewing these items and responding at
your earliest convenience. We have advised members of your staff of
this request. We will be happy to work directly with your staff to meet
this congressional need. To the extent that any of this information is
not available, we will need, in writing, the legislative citations or
precedents for not supplying the data.

Mr. Kelley asked that in connection with future festimony
we prepare two papers. One is to be a dissertation about our procedures
in opening and closing domestic security cases, including the application
of criteria for opening such cases and determining how long the cases
should remain in a pending status The second paper is to involve the
jurisdiction of the President to authorize unusual investigative techniques
in foreign intelligence investigations such as wiretaps, microphones
and surreptitious entries. This should include a definition of his
Constitutional powers and the derivative authority invested in the Attorney
General and the FBI.

In connection with these two papers, it is desired that there be
coordination between the Intelligence Division, Legal Counsel Division
and writers in the External Affairs Division, who should participate in the
basic research and discussions and prepare the final paper outlining the
research and analysis of the other two divisions.

Mr. Kelley's purpose is to have papers available on various topics
such as this which reduce technical dissertations to a style which can be
used for argumentative purposes in an easily understood form. The types
of questions he receives generally do not require a highly technical response
but a concise presentation of the issues involved and the propriety of our
procedures.

@Senate Select Commitee, ON INTELLIGENCE Activities Fo
This Committee which is chaired by Congresswoman Bella S.
Abzug (D-N.Y.) convened on March 5th to hear testimony from Director of
the CIA, William E. Colby. It was brought out at the hearing that the
Central Intelligence Agency had furnished information in their files pertaining
to Congresswoman Abzug the previous evening, March 4th, with the exception
of information which could not be disclosed without compromising a sensitive
source or intelligence gathering procedure. Director Colby also advised
Congresswoman Abzug in response to her inquiry that the source of some
litems that she was in receipt of had been concealed because it was from
another agency. Colby did not disclose the identity of that agency.

ORIGINAL FILED IN

Congresswoman Abzug asked Colby, and he agreed to
communicate with that agency and have them contact Congresswoman Abzug
concerning the aforementioned information. By way of background according
to a memorandum captioned \"Bella S. Abzug (D-N.Y.),\" dated 3-4-75, the
CIA asked for and received permission from this Bureau to release the PORTION
contents of unclassified reports furnished the CIA by the FBI and could be
furnished by the CIA to Congresswoman Abzug. From the remarks made
by Director Colby, it would appear that the topic of discussion between
Congresswoman Abzug and Director Colby pertained to these documents
and that we can expect some communication from the CIA in accordance
with Congresswoman Abzug's request.
RE

During the question and answer portion of Director Colby's
testimony, Director Colby stated that the CIA would obtain information
pertaining to American citizens in only two instances in the future. (1) Infor-
mation developed incidental to their surveillance of a foreign target

Legal Counsel to J. B. Adams Memo
Re: HOUSE GOVERNMENT INFORMATION IN
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS SUBCOMMITTEE

(2) Investigations conducted pursuant to FBI requests. He was asked
what the CIA's response would be to an improper request for investigation
concerning American citizens. He indicated that they would refuse such
a request and had done so in the past. The implication being from the
context of the question that the FBI had made an improper request of
the CIA.

In view of the wide scope of authority enjoyed by
Congresswoman Abzug's Committee and the realistic expectation the
FBI will have to testify before this Committee, it would be to our advantage
for the Intelligence Division, through liaison, with the Central Intelligence
Agency to obtain a transcript of this Committee hearing so that same
might be reviewed and possible questions contained therein concerning
FBI investigations be analyzed and responses prepared.

RECOMMENDATION:

Intelligence Division take action in line with the above.

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting of
the Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on
Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community, (hereafter
referred to as the Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the even-
ing of 3/20/75.

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role as
the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). In attendance were
Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; Deputy AG Laurence
Silberman; Associate Deputy AG James Wilderotter; Mr. John
Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI, as well as officials from
Defense, Treasury and the Energy Research and Development
Administration (formerly the Atomic Energy Commission).

The meeting was called to have all agencies identify
(1) Types of information that could not be disclosed to Con-
gressional Committees, (2) Types of information the disclosure
of which was arguable, and (3) Types of information that could
be disclosed to Congressional Committees. The FBI was asked to
lead off the presentation. The Group was informed that we were
reluctant to discuss sensitive matters in such a large group
Jand we asked that the Group be reduced to a select few people
who would have to have knowledge of sensitive FBI operations.
After some discussion, the White House agreed this was a good
procedure and it now appears that Mr. Buchen of the White House,
one of his associates and probably Mr. Silberman will arrange
at some future date to discuss the sensitive type information
embraced in the above three questions. No definite date was
set for this review and presumably either Mr. Clarke's office
or Mr. Silberman will be in contact with the Bureau regarding
this.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

this paper was on the agenda for this meeting, it was never
discussed because of the length of meeting, concluding at
approximately 8:30 p.m. Following the meeting, Assistant
Director Mintz and Mr. Cregar had a discussion with Mr. Wilderotter.
During this discussion Mr. Mintz pointed out to Mr. Wilderotter
that it was imperative that this Executive Committee clearly
define how responses to the Select Committees would be coordinated
and how matters dealing with policy would be cleared with the
White House. Mr. Wilderotter described the following procedure.
All questions received by agencies of the Intelligence Community
from Select Committees would be furnished to Mr. Clarke. As a
matter of fact, Mr. Wilderotter advised a copy of the questions
received by the Department from the Senate Select Committee
requiring responses from the FBI had already been turned over to
Mr. Clarke by Mr. Wilderotter. Upon receipt of a copy of such
questions, Mr. Clarke would review them and attempt to identify
which questions involve policy matters of interest to the White
House. He would then inform all agencies involved in such a
response that such a question involved policy. Those agencies
would be obliged to discuss the response between themselves and.
arrive at a coordinated answer. That answer would then be
furnished to Mr. Clarke who would in turn make a decision as to
whether it should go forward to the White House forresolution.
Answers to questions which did not involve policy matters would
also have to be furnished to Mr. Clarke to insure that there was
some coordinating mechanism in the Community and to insure that this
mechanism was in possession of all questions and all answers which
might be provided the Select Committees.

Mr. Mintz made it quite clear to Mr. Wilderotter that
this was not the Bureau's understanding of how the coordination
process would work and was of the belief that no other agency
represented on the Executive Committee was aware of this procedure.
Mr. Wilderotter was asked to develop such a procedure for pre-
sentation to the Group to insure everybody was in agreement as to
how this process would work.

On the morning of 3/21/75, Mr. Clarke advised that
as a result of the meeting during the evening of 3/20/75 he was
completely confused and was at a loss as to how the coordination
process was going to work. He advised Mr. Cregar that he would

attempt to get some clarification and hopefully be in a
position to provide some information as to how the White House,
Mr. Silberman and Mr. Wilderotter wanted to proceed.

It is the opinion of both Mr. Mintz and Mr. Wannall
that the Bureau must immediately set up a Task Force to handle
the tremendous amount of information that will be required
from the FBI, including the coordination of our responses with
other agencies who might be involved in such an answer, as well
as to insure that both the Department of Justice and the White
House are fully informed. We can anticipate very short deadlines
and requests for information that are not readily retrievable
from Bureau records without considerable research involving
several divisions in the Bureau.

the coordination of such information responsive to the requests

A. RESPONSIBILITIES AND SUPPORT

In treating with Congressional inquiries, the Director of Central
Intelligence will provide leadership to the Intelligence Community.
The Associate Deputy to the DCI for the Intelligence Community,
supported by the Intelligence Community Staff, will provide the
principal staff direction and congressional liaison for the DCI in these
matters. He will serve as a focal point for coordination among Community
entities and assure communication with the Executive Office as appropriate.
The IC Staff with the assistance of USIB-Agencies will provide legal,.
security, substantive, and registry support structured so as to assure
Cappropriate support to the DCI and the Intelligence Community. The
AD/DCI/IC will chair an Ad Hoc Coordinating Group of USIB as a
principal mechanism for exchanging information and coordinating USIB
activities with respect to the inquiry where needed. The AD/DCI/IC and
the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group will establish periodic and special
time sensitive reporting to keep the DCI, the USIB principals, and involved
Executive Branch agencies advised on USIB Agencies' liaison relationships
with the Select Committees and on substantive exchanges in response to
Select Committee inquiries. Where useful, common standards and procedures
will be developed by the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group.

B. COORDINATION

1. Physical security is proceeding well. The Chairman of the Security
Committee of USIB has been assigned as the principal Intelligence Community
officer on physical security and clearance matters. Agreements have been
reached with the Senate Select Committee on physical security standards.
These standards have been provided to the House Select Committee Staff.
The Senate has arranged for central facilities which meet the physical
security standards and has appointed a full-time security officer who will
provide certification of personnel clearances. The House at the present
time is not planning central facilities and we understand will be dispersed
in at least three different locations.

Discussion of classified information will occur outside of the
security-approved Committee rooms and particularly in the offices of the
members of the Select Committee. Agreement has been reached that the FBI
will approach the House and Senate Staff Directors and offer technical sweep
services for the Congressional offices involved.
NW 88608 Docld:32989530 Page 18
ANCLOSE:
62:116395-44

2. Personnel security investigations on Select Committee Staff are
under way by the FBI. It is understood that upon completion of Staff
investigations, the Select Committee Chairman will certify to the DCI
the Top Secret clearances of Committee Staff. The DCI, through his
Intelligence Community Staff, will pass along the certification to the
security elements of the respective agencies. Compartmented clearance
arrangements and certification also have been agreed with the Senate Select
Committee Staff. Similar arrangements have been discussed with the House
Select Committee Staff.

3. Secrecy agreements for the Senate Select Committee Staff employees :.
are being drafted and the AD/DCI/IC, supported by the CIA General Counsel
and the Associate Deputy Attorney General, will negotiate similar arrange-
ments with the House. The DCI policy is to insist upon secrecy agreements..

4. Arrangements will be established by the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group for the recording of documents, testimony and transcripts, and for
procedures to protect sources and methods which may be contained in the
material flowing to the Seleci Cuimiliees from all agencies. A cenirai
index service will be provided by the Intelligence Community Staff to serve
the DCI and USIB Agencies. The following describes the general content
of this central index.

At 2:30 p.m. on June 2, 1975, a conference was held
with the Deputy Attorney General attended by K. William O'Connor,
Kevin Maroney, Philip White, and Robert McDermott of the Department.
Bureau representatives were Mr. Callahan, Mr. Adams, Mr. Wannall and me.

Mr. O'Connor discussed the request by the Senate Select
Committee for access to the 39 page report by former Assistant Attorney
General Petersen concerning COINTELPRO. Though objections were
presented by the Bureau representatives that the report should not be
furnished to the Committee, and its enclosures, particularly the legal
memoranda should not be made available, the Deputy Attorney General
decided and instructed that the 39 page report should be made available
to John Elliff on Tuesday, June 3, 1975, for his review, at which time he
would be permitted to take notes, but he would not be furnished a copy of
the document. The Deputy further instructed that should Mr. Elliff request
the attachments to the report, Mr. O'Connor should offer as an alternative
the memoranda which initiated each of the COINTELPROS.

Reference is made to your letter dated April 9,
1975, enclosing a resolution adopted by the State Bar of
California condemning the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) for placing an informant on the staff of a legal
service agency to communicate information learned in that
capacity to the FBI and our response dated April 28, 1975.

Contact with the State Bar of California has
enabled us to identify the situation to which they were
referring.
*
Between April, 1968, and November, 1968, one
Rudolph Leamer Muse was operated as an informant by our
New Orleans, Louisiana, Division. Muse furnished information
regarding black extremist activities and he was paid for
services rendered. Muse was unemployed when initially
volunteering his assistance to the FBI and subsequently, on
May 10, 1968, began working as an investigator for the
New Orleans Legal Assistance Corps (NOLAC), an organization
funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity.

Information in the files of our New Orleans Division
indicates during June, 1968, Euse advised it had become
necessary to tell his supervisor at NOLAC of his relationship
with the FBI. His supervisor became aware of Muse's assoc-
iation with black nationalist groups and attempted to discharge
him. To avoid discharge, Muse told his supervisor he was
cooperating with the FBI. Subsequently Muse's supervisor
from NOLAC contacted the New Orleans Division and advised
he wanted to assure the FBI that the relationshi

Muse and the FBI would be maintained by him and would go
no further. Muse's supervisor said he was cognizant of
the importance of Muse's cooperation with the FBI remaining
confidential.

The New Orleans Division of the FBI never
conducted any investigation regarding NOLAC and Muse
never furnished information concerning its activities.

I hope this information will clarify the issue
for you. If I may be of further assistance in this matter,
please contact me.

A copy of this letter is being provided to the

NOTE:
}
The resolution of the State Bar of California (SBC)
referred to above did not identify the specific incident in
which they were interested so Congressman Wiggins' letter was
acknowledged and we indicated additional details would follow.
On 4/25/75 San Francisco advised the basis for the SBC resolution
was articles contained in the 2/7/75 issues of the San Francisco
Examiner and Oakland Tribune. In these articles Muse was not
mentioned by name but the details corresponded with his case.
On 4/28/75 Supervisor Ernest Wall, New Orleans, advised Muse
was identified by name in articles concerning this incident
in the 2/2/75 issue of the New Orleans Times Picayune and the
2/25/75 issue of the New Orleans States Item. Since Muse
revealed his relationship with the FBI and has been publicly
identified by name and appears to be no privacy issue or need
to protect the confidentiality of our files, Congressman Wiggins
should be advised of the complete details in this matter. As'
the SBC urged issues such as this be considered by the select
committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, a
copy of this communication is being furnished for the information
of the Legal Analysis Section and Project Senstudy 75 in
Division 5.

Principal-s-of-the-US-I-B-Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group
: Ninth Meeting, 4 June 1975

1. A meeting of the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group
was held on 4 June 1975 at 10:00 a.m. A list of attendees
is attached.

2. The meeting was opened by Dr. Clarke who described
the current activities of the Senate Select Committee in-
accelerating their official interviews with knowledgeable-
officials across the Community and the criticality of firming
up agreements on how these interviews are to be handled.
This has not been forthcoming despite White House interest.
House Select Committee procedure is not yet clear.

3. The second item raised by the Chairman was the
list of category II \"abuses\" which had been developed at
the direction of the Policy Steering Group. The set developed
was the result of discussions with Mr. Schwartz, Counsel to
the Senate Select Committee, who plans to present a complete
list of \"category II\" items to the Committee on Friday, 6
June. At that point, it is expected \"notices\" would go out
to the Community agencies advising them so that agreed
interview procedures will apply. It is also anticipated
that the presence of private as well as Agency counsel will
be addressed. The Policy Steering Group has accepted the
principle of dealing with these identified category II\"
subjects by assigning responsibility for gathering $211638--1
comprehensive and paper preparation to specific individuals
within the Community agencies. Dr. Clarke is the focalor RE ORDED
point for gathering the names of individuals who will assume
these responsibilities. To date, individuals had been named 1.6.1975
for all subjects except those to be handled by CIA.

RE: SUPERSEDED SECTIONS OF THE
MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS

Reference is made to the SSC memorandur, with
attached appendices, dated April 30, 1975, requesting
certain documents and other information from the FBI.

Part one of referenced memorandum requested this
Bureau to make available for review various superseded
sections of the Manual of Instructions (MOI). Appendix A
attached to referenced memorandum set forth the sections
requested for review. Mr. Mark Gitenstein, SSC Staff
Member, has advised FBI Special Agent Paul V. Daly that
revisions to the MOI should cover the period January 1,
1960, to the present.

These superseded sections are now ready for
review at FBI Headquarters by appropriately cleared
personnel of the SSC Staff. It should be noted that for the
period January 1, 1960, to the present, there were no
revisions of MOI Sections 95 and 97.

Re: Superseded Sections of the
Manual of Instructions

NOTE:

Pursuant to a prior SSC request, we furnished them
current MOI Sections 36, 84, 86, 87, 88, 95, 97 and 122.
Due to the sensitive nature of Sections 105, 107 and 130,
these were made available for review only at FBIHQ.

Listed below are the Intelligence Division
representatives and the MOI sections reviewed for this
project:

Section 36-Espionage James W. Johnson CI-1
Section 84-Registration Act Dennis R. Dickson CI-3
Section 86-Sabotage Louis J. Brune IS-2
Section 87-Investigations of William N. Preusse IS-2
Subversive Organizations and Thomas J. McNiff
Individuals
Section 88-Sedition George J. Lex IS-2
Section 105-Internal Security- James W. Johnson CI-1

Section 107-Internal Security Edward P. Grigalus IS-2

intelligence Assets Dennis R. Dickson CI-3
Section 122-Extremist Matters Robert D. Shea IS-1

Section 130-Extremist Informants Robert D. Shea IS-1
and Sources

As previously noted, there were no MOI revisions
during the period of interest to Section 95-Treason and
Section 97-Voorhis Act.

The revisions of the MOI requested by SSC consists
of approximately 2,200 pages and is approximately 9\" in
height. Due to the bulkiness of these revisions, they are
not being attached to this memorandum.

RE: REQUEST PERTAINING TO ELECTRONIC
SURVEILLANCE

Reference is made to SSC letter to the Attorney General,
with attached appendices, dated May 14, 1975, requesting certain
documents and other information from the FBI.

In Appendix D, captioned \"Request Pertaining to
Electronic Surveillance,\" the SSC desired a response to the
following request:

Item 15. \"All July and August memoranda from former
Special Agent (SA) Leo T. Clark to the Assistant Special Agent
in Charge (ASAC) or the Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the
Newark, New Jersey, Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), captioned 'Protection of the President - White House
Inquiry.'\"

In regard to the aforementioned, a thorough review of
the files of the Newark Office of the FBI did not reveal the
existence of a file bearing the caption, \"Protection of the
President - White House Inquiry.\" However, this review did
disclose the existence of a file bearing the caption, \"Protection
of the President. A thorough review of this file failed to
uncover any memoranda emanating from former SA Leo T. Clark at
any time.

In addition, a thorough review of other files main-
tained at the Newark Office believed relevant to the subject
matter of this inquiry, did not reveal any memoranda, letters
or other type communications prepared by former SA Clark.

A thorough review of pertinent FBIHQ files discloses
no nemoranda emanating from former SA Clark regarding this
ratter.

SUBJECT: SUGGESTED NAME CHANGE
XCRIME RECORDS DIVISION. DATE: 10-16-72
:

By memorandum dated 10-4-72, attached, it was
indicated that
has suggested
a name change for the Crime Records Division to Office
of Public Information or some other more meaningful designation.

It was pointed out that
suggestion
was in line with informal discussions you (Mr. Bishop)
have had with members of your staff concerning a possible
name change for the Division.

In this connection, Mr. Gray has noted that
he \"can think of many reasons for changing the name.
What have been the nature of the reasons for change discussed?\"

With the formation of the Computer Systems Division
and the resultant reassignment of the personnel and
the work of the Uniform Crime Reporting Section, including
the National Crime Information Center/Computerized Criminal
Histories file from Crime Records to Computer Systems,
the title \"Crime Records,\" as
has indicated,
is no longer meaningful insofar as the work of this
Division is concerned.

\"Office of Püblic Information,\" which was
suggested by
would inaccurately reflect
the activities and responsibilities ies of this Division
and could result in confusion with the Office of Public
Information in the Department of Justice. This, of
course, would be undesirable.

M. A. Jones to Mr. Bishop Memo
RE: SUGGESTED NAME CHANGE CRIME RECORDS DIVISION
: :

It is noted that this Division, which is presently
comprised of the Crime Research Section, and the Correspondence
and Tours Section, is primarily responsible for conducting
extensive rèsearch pertaining to crime, crime prevention,..
and other related matters in the law enforcement field.
This Division is involved in the review and préparation
of replies to correspondence regarding FBI Jurisdiction
and operations received from law enforcement, other Government
agencies, and the general public in those instances where
the Bureau has a responsibility to disseminate such information.
....
::.
.....

\"The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin,\" which is the
official publication of the FBI, is prepared and distributed
by Crime Records, as well as numerous pamphlets for the
instruction and information of Bureau employees, the law
enforcement profession and the general public. This Division
is responsible for supervision of tours of Bureau facilities
for Government officials, law enforcement authorities,
and the general public; directs the program of distributing
informative and illustrative material on Bureau fugitives
to various media for the purpose of effecting the location
and apprehension of these criminals with the help of citizen
cooperation; and coordinates and supervises the Bureau's
interests in the utilization of radio, television, and
publication outlets to enhance the discharge of our responsi-
bilities in the law enforcement field by acquainting the
public with the FBI's operations and activities.

In addition, this Division has the custody of
a number of research and reference files which are maintained
in a current status and which are essential to the Division
in the fulfillment of its responsibilities to the Bureau.
:
Further, this Division supervises the \"Ten-Most-
Wanted Fugitives\" Program, as well as \"The FBI\" television
series, both of which involve research for their sustenance
and success.

Pursuant to your instructions, Assistant Director Bishop is
being temporarily attached to the Training Division at Quantico for special
assignment until the effective date of his retirement, 2-1-73.

Mr. Bishop will be assigned to the research and development of
a major case practical problem for use in the National Academy. This
is extremely important because our experience indicates that most of the
officers attending the Academy are unable to understand and handle the
ramifications of major cases. Mr. Bishop, with his extensive field back-
ground, plus his familiarity with news media problems, is ideally suited
to handle this assignment.

If he has time, Mr. Bishop will also analyze and develop
meaningful practieal cases which will enable new agents to meet present-
day needs.

I have arranged with Mr. Jenkins for suitable office facilities
to be used by Mr. Bishop at Quantico and have instructed Bishop to report
to Mr. Jenkins on Monday, 12-4-72.

is being diverted from his current

By letter 7/7/75 to the Honorable Frank Church,
we noted that the Senate Select Committee had in its possession
certain materials, which were compiled by the Commission on
CIA Activities Within the United States, for the preparation
of its report to the President, which materials most probably
contained information regarding FBI operations of the utmost
sensitivity. In order to avoid any inadvertent compromise of
such information, we requested an opportunity to meet with
Senators Church and Tower at the earliest convenience to
discuss areas of this Bureau's activities which might warrant
special consideration. Senator Church agreed that the above
matter would be discussed with Director Kelley at the latter's
appearance before the Executive Session of the Senate Select
Committee meeting scheduled for 7/16/75.

For your additional information, this Bureau had
earlier ascertained that the Senate Select Committee has had
access to a 693-page document prepared by CIA listing instances
wherein CIA believed its operations may have exceeded its
mandate. A review of this document by Bureau personnel indi-
cated that some of these operations involve matters involving
this Bureau of an extremely sensitive nature. In response to
a request of CIA for copies of pertinent material contained
in the above 693-page document, CIA on this date furnished
copies of the material requested.

3 JUL 22 1975

In anticipation of the Director's appearance before
SSC on 7/16/75, the above material furnished by CIA consisting
of approximately 174 pages was reviewed. This material is
found to contain numerous references, in sanitized form, to

Set out below is information concerning an
interview of FBI SA William D. Campbell by SSC Staff Members.
Campbell is currently assigned to FBI Headquarters. The
details of the interview are as furnished by Campbell.

On advance notice from lir. Michael Epstein, SSC
Staff Member, Campbell was advised that he was to be interviewed
at 11:00 a.m., June 27, 1975, in the SSC offices. Campbell
vas informed by the Legal Counsel Division of the FBI that
he was being released_from any applicable employment agreement
for purposes of the SSC interview concerning the former FBI
investigations of Martin Luther King, Jr., Stanley David
Levison and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
It was explained to Campbell that he had a right to counsel;
however, the FDI was unable to provide private counsel.
Campbell was also told that there were certain privileged
areas concerning which he would not be required to answer
questions. These areas concerned information thich night
divulge the icontities of FBI sources; information relating
to sensitive methods and techniques; information which might
adversely affect ongoing FDI investigations; and information

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SA BY SSC

Campbell advised he was on a squad in the security area,
that his Supervisor was E. H. Belter and that the Security
Coordinating Supervisor was L. W. R. Oberndorf, now deceased.

Epstein then asked that they get to the point and
inquired of Campbell as to when he had heard about the King
case. Campbell responded that sometime early in 1964 he
heard of the case and recalled it was shortly after the
assassination of President Kennedy, and King had been named
Man of the Year (\"Time\" Magazine), that Campbell became
knowledgeable under the following circumstances. Campbell
was summoned to the office of the SAC either by a fellow SA,
Bill Bergeron, or by Supervisor Belter, specific individual
not recalled. Present in the office was the SAC at the time,
Marlin Johnson, the then FBI Assistant Director William C.
Sullivan, Bergeron and probably several others, names not
recalled. The following was related by Campbell in response
to Epstein's questions concerning what tock place at the
conference

After some opening remarks by the SAC, Sullivan
advised that he did not want any of the information they
were to discuss to leave the room. Sullivan said that he
had information indicating that King was associating with
communists and that it was possible that King's movement was
being infiltrated. As a result, Sullivan said he wanted a
technical installation on King in an effort to verify this
information.

3
At some later date, Campbell was assigned to
monitor the technical installation on King in which a radio
transmitter was used. He could not recall whether the
equipment was signed out to him but he did take the equipment
home and on a Sunday afternoon he took a bus to Union Station.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE; INTERVIEU OF FBI SA BY SSC

Hó walked around for a short time and then went by cab to
the Willard Hotel and checked in under an assumed name
(name not recalled). These actions were taken by him as
a security precaution. He did not recall who made his
reservation at the hotel. The first night King did not
enter the room which Campbell was monitoring. Campbell
could not recall the names of the individuals who occupied
the room he vas monitoring but did recall that they were
associated with the King party. The next day, Campbell and
a fellow SA, John Dorys, noved to a different room. He
could not recall how the arrangements for the rove were made.

Campbell and Dorys monitored King for about two
days, stayed one extra day at the hotel and then chocked
out. Lither Campbell or Borys remained in the room at all
times. One of them would take the logs and tapes out of
the hotel each day and turn then over to someone from IFO,
details not recalled. At no time did Campbell ever enter any
roon in the hotel that was occupied by King or any member of
King's party. The tape recorder they utilized was manually
operated and they attempted to run it at all times when
someone was in the room being monitored. Campbell knew of
no physical or photographic surveillance on King during that
time. Campbell also advised that he could not recall any
instructions concerning listening only to certain types of
conversations.

Epstein inquired as to whother Campbell kept a
card at WFO showing his location. He responded that it was
the normal practice to place a card in the usual repository
when one was away from the office. In this particular case,
if Campbell did leave a card, he would have probably placed
a notation on it such as \"Special - Sec Supervisor Belter
for contact.\"

SEMATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGE.CE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: LITERVIEW OF FBI SA BY SSC

In response to direct questioning, Campbell advised
that he had never seen any paper (memoranda, etc.) dealing
with this case other than the logs previously mentioned.

Epstein inquired as to whether Campbell had ever
seen the tapes again after he had departed the hotel. Campbell
advised that sometime later, possibly one or two months, he
was asked to review the tapes and logs in an effort to obtain
additional information. He did this at the FBI Laboratory
and was assisted by SA John Matter, retired in the technical
enhancement techniques, such as filtering. Campbell was not
directed to concentrate on any one part of the tapes but
reviewed all of them. He did not type any of the information
overheard and if any such typing was done, it was probably
done in the Intelligence Division. Campbell has not seen
the tapes since that time.

On Epstein's inquiry, Campbell advised he first
heard about the planned interview of him from SA Paul V. Daly
of the FBI's Legal Counsel Division and did not discuss the
King case with Bergeron, Matter or Borys after that contact.
Campbell did not know whether or not the tapes are still in
existence.

Miss Deoreo inquired as to whether it was the
normal practice to erase tapes. Campbell answered that in
this type of an investigation he was sure only new tapes were
used. He explained he was certain that tapes were new when
he found them still wrapped in cellophane and they had the
appearance of new tapes. She also inquired as to how he
secured the key for the second room in the hotel and whether
he had to re-register. He answered that he did not recall
but felt certain he did not re-register and that some other
SA from UFO probably obtained the key for him. During the

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SA BY SSC

monitoring, no persons other than Campbell and, Borys entered
the monitoring room. Additional responses to questions from
Epstein were as follows. Campbell utilized only one radio
receiver and listened to only one radio microphone. He
could not recall if there were any others in use. He and
Borys took turns listening to the transmitter. Campbell
did not remove the transmitter when he left the hotel as he
never entered any of the rooms assigned to the King party.
Campbell did not know any details concerning Mr. Sullivan's
remarks about King's association with communists. Campbell
did not attend all the meetings at WFO concerning the King
installation. It was his best recollection that the monitoring
was done in rooms one floor above the rooms occupied by the
King party.

At the end of the interview, Epstein indicated he
had one final question which was, as best Campbell could
remember, \"Is there anything else about this case that you
know that has not come out because I did not ask the right
question or did not ask a question in the right way?\" Campbell
replied that he felt that Epstein had done a good job in
asking the questions.

NOTE:

Assistant Director Mintz briefed Campbell prior to
his interview. Campbell was accompanied to the SSC offices
by Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project but
Phillips was not called upon for any consultation.

When
Epstein then stated lets get to the point.
did you hear about the King case. I responded that some-
time early in 1964
recalled since it was shortly after
President Kennedy was shot and King was named man of the
year I was summons to the SAC's office either by my
associate Bill Bergeron or my supervisor Mr. Belter not
specifically recalled. The SAC, Marlin Johnson, Assistant
Director William Sullivan, Bergeron and probably several
others not recalled were in attendance. The following is
a narrative of information I furnished in response to
Epstein's questions.

The SAC made several remarks and Assistant Director
Sullivan then stated that he did not want any information
discussed to leave the room. Sullivan stated he had informa-
tion that indicated King was associating with communists and
it was possible his movement was being infiltrated. Sullivan
said he wanted a technical installation on King in an effort
to verify this information.

At some later date I was assigned to monitor the
installation which was a radio transmitter. I could not
recall if the equipment was signed out to me or not but I
took the equipment home and on a Sunday afternoon I caught a
bus to Union Station, I walked around for a short time and then
by cab went to the hotel and checked in under an assumed
name (name not remembered) I did not recall who made my
reservations. The first night King did not enter the room
we were monitoring. (I did not recall the names of
individuals who occupied room but they were associated with
King party.) The next day we (John Borys of WFO and myself)
moved to a different room. I could not recall how the
arrangements for the move was made. We then monitored King
for about two days, stayed one extra day at the hotel, and
checked out. Either Borys or myself stayed in the room at
all time. One would take the logs and tapes out of the
hotel each day and turn them over to someone from WFO (details
not recalled). At no time did I ever enter any room in the
hotel that was occupied ed by King or any member of his party.
The tape recorder was manually operated and we attempted to
run it any time someone was in the room. I know of no physical
or photographic surveillance on King during this time.
had no instructions that I can recall concerning only listening
to certain types of conversation.

I

Epstein asked if I kept a card at the office
showing my location. I responded that it was the normal
practice to place a card in file when one was away from
the office. In this case, if I placed a card in file I
probably would place a notation like \"Special - See
Supervisor Belter for contact.\"

I had never seen any paper, memos, etc. (other
than logs) dealing with this case.

Epstein asked if I ever saw the tapes again
after departing the hotel. I stated that sometime after
(possibly one or two months) I was asked to review the tapes
and logs in an effort to obtain additional information. I
did this at the FBI Laboratory and was assisted by SA John
Matter, retired, in the technical enhancement techniques -
such as filtering. I was not directed to concentrate on
any one part of the tapes but reviewed all of the tapes.

it was probably typed in the Intelligence Division.

I have

I first heard about my interview from Mr. Daly of
the Legal Division and did not discuss this case with
Mr. Bergeron, Mr. Matter or Mr. Borys after that contact.
I do not know if the tapes are still in existance.
DE Oreo
Dorio asked if it was the normal practice to
erase tapes. I stated that in this type investigation I
was sure only new tapes were used. I was certain the tapes
were new if they were still wrapped in cellophane and they
had the appearance of new tapes. She also asked how I got
the key for the second room at the hotel and did I have
to re-register. I stated, I did not recall but felt sure I
did not re-register and some agent from WFO probably got
the key to me. No other person entered the rooms except
Borys and myself where the monitoring was taking place.

Other responses to questions from Epstein were:
We only had one radio receiver and only listened to one
radio microphone, I could not recall if there were others.
Borys and myself took turns listening to the transmitter.
I did not remove the transmitter when I left the hotel as I
never entered any of the rooms assigned to the King party.

One final question from Epstein. Is there anything
else about this case that you know that has not come out
because I did not ask the right question or asked a question
in the right way. I advised I felt he had done a good job
in asking the questions.

Additional answers to questions. I did not
know any details concerning Mr. Sullivan's remarks about
King's association with communists. I did not attend all of
the meetings at WFO concerning the King installation. My
best recollection was that the monitoring was in rooms one
floor above the rooms occupied by King.

replying, of consulting with an FBI representative who would
accompany him to the interview. The representative would
not be present during the actual interview but would morely
be available nearby in the ovent consultation was desired.

The details of the interview, as voluntarily
furnished by Conrad, are as follows.

Conrad was interviewed in SSC quarters for the
approximate period 10:10 a.m. to 10:45 a.m., July 9, 1975,
by SSC Staff Members Michael Epstein and Mary DeOrco. No
mention of Conrad's rights was made. The following details
are not necessarily in chronological order.

Conrad was questioned concerning his career in the
FBI and the positions which he held. He replied that he
entered the FBI in 1934 and was assigned to the Laboratory
where he spent his entire FDI career. During the 1940's, he
was placed in charge of the Radio Engineering Section (RF)..
In 1955, he became the Number One Man, the equivalent of being
the Deputy AD in the Laboratory. In 1961, he was elevated to
the position of AD, which he held until his retirement in
mid-1973.

Conrad vas queried as to whether the Laboratory
was broken dom into various sections at the time he was AD.
He responded that there were four sections in the Laboratory:
Document, Physics and Chemistry, RE, and Cryptanalysis-Translation.
He was asked as to whether the sections were further broken
down into units and was asked for any such specific breakdown
in the RF.. His answer was that while there were unit breakdowns,
he did not recall the specific breakdown within the RE. He
was asked as to the basis for unit breakdowns and advised it
vas based upon sensitivity and expertise of the work; both
factors entered into consideration with the greater weight placed
upon the expertise factor.

SEVATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: INTERVIE OF FORMER FBI AD BY SSC

Conrad was told that the SSC was focusing on an
allegation that some tapes were made of a conversation of
Martin Luther King, Jr., and that these tapes were mailed
outside of the FBI. Conrad was also told that the SSC had
been advised that Conrad had been requested to make copies
of such tapes for the indicated purpose of mailing outside
the FBI. Conrad was then asked what he knew about this
matter. His answer was that he did not know or recall
anything that would fit the description above. Conrad asked
Epstein if the latter could indicate a time frame which
might assist Conrad in his recall. Epstein said they were
referring to the early 1960's, after which Conrad responded
that that was a long time ago and Conrad was just unable to
recall anything on the allegation. Conrad was asked if he
recalled making copies of a tape dealing with King without
knowing it was for the purpose of the tapes being mailed.
His response was \"No.\"

Conrad was asked if he had known that the FBI had
technical coverage of King. His response was, \"Hot specifically.\"
He was then asked what he meant by \"specifically\" and this
point was pressed by the interrogators. Conrad responded
that he recalled that FBI Director Hoover had announced
publicly that the FBI had in effect a number of wire taps,
thus indicating that a number of FBI subjects who were under
investigation were thus covered through such means. However,
Conrad did not know or recall that King was actually one of
the subjects of such coverage.

Conrad was asked whether he recalled, aside from
the King case, whether any recordings were sent to the
Laboratory for processing or copying when they related to
civil rights matters. His response was, \"No.\"

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI AD BY SSC

Conrad was asked who was in charge of the RE and
* responded by asking for time frame He was told the
reference was to the early 1960's and Conrad responded that,
because of the turnover of personnel, he could not respond
to any specific times. He was then asked who was in charge.
at the time Conrad retired in 1973 and he gave the name of
Wayne Bradley (retired). He was asked how long Bradley was
the Section Chief of RE and Conrad answered that he could
not remember.

In
Conrad was asked whether it was common to make
copies of tapes derived from technical coverage. He responded
that it was done on occasion and explained that tapes would
sometimes be sent to the Laboratory in order to obtain more
coherent copies through a process known as filtering.
such instances, filtered copies were produced in the
Laboratory. When asked where this was done, Conrad said it
was done in the RE. He was asked whether all tapes derived
from technical coverage were sent to the Laboratory and his
response was \"No.\" He was asked if all technical coverage
tapes were maintained by the Laboratory and his response
was \"No.\" When asked. under what conditions they would be
sent to the Laboratory, Conrad advised that they would be
sent to the Laboratory when it was necessary to have them
filtered. In response to inquiry as to what the mechanics
were of getting the tapes to the Laboratory, Conrad said there
was no single procedure. They might be sent by a field office
directly to the laboratory with a request for assistance in
making the tapes more readable; or, the assistance of this
nature might originate with an FBI Headquarters official.

Conrad was asked for the detailed mechanics of the
routing requests for filtering and he responded that he did
not see how this bore on the King matter. He was then asked
whether a record was always made of requests for filtering,

NW 88608, Docld:32989617 Page 19

RO: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI AD BY SSC

and he responded that, if the request was from the field,
there would normally be a cover communication which would
be the permanent record. However, if the request was from
a Headquarters official, there might not always be a written
record. He was asked how the material would get to a specific
person in the Laboratory and he responded by saying that it
might be routed directly by the sender or routed to the
Laboratory generally, and then from the central routing
point in the Laboratory it would be sent to either RE or the
specific person who would handle the matter. Conrad was
asked hor a router would know where to send such an item and
he responded that there would be information in the cover
communication which would assist in this routing.

Conrad was asked whether it was necessary to
account by inventory for all tapes used in making copies of

This memorandum reports the receipt of a legal
memorandum prepared by Mr. Edmund Cohen, Office of the General
Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, entitled \"Authority of
Congress to Release Classified Data.\" Copies of this legal
memorandum have been furnished to Mr. Anthonin Scalia, Assistant
Attorney General, and Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel
to the President.

Memorandum Cregar to W. R. Wannall dated 4/14/75 discussed
an article contained in the 4/10/75 edition of \"The Washington Post\"
wherein Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Select
Committee, stated he reserved the right to make public any documents
the Committee received. This memorandum also noted that Mr. James
Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, advised that
The White House was preparing a letter to Senator Church recognizing
that Congress can, at its discretion, declassify material it
receives, but strongly urging that such declassification action
not be taken unilaterally by the Senate Select Committee without
approval of the agency originating the information.

As an aid to the preparation of such a letter, the
Office of CIA's General Counsel has prepared a paper entitled
\"Authority of Congress to Release Classified Data.\" Copy attached.
It was made available to all members of the Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group for Congressional Review of the Intelligence Committee for
information and any comments recipients desired to make.

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel

SUBJECT : Authority of Congress to Release Classified Data
:

1. I have found no express authority for Congress to publicly release
information classified by the executive branch pursuant to an Executive
order issued by the President. Moreover, on a number of occasions Congress
has mandated that matters pertaining to national defense or foreign policy
be kept secret,
:

--Congress has made it a crime for one lawfully having possession,
access or control of documents relating to national defense or infor-
mation relating to the national defense which the possessor has
reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States
or to the advantage of any foreign nation to communicate, deliver,
or transmit same to any person not entitled to receive it. 18
U.S.C.A. 793(d),

--Congress has made it a crime to disclose to an unauthorized per-
son or publish any classified information obtained by the processes
of communications intelligence. 18 U.S.C.A. 798(a).

--Congress has made it a crime to photograph or sketch vital military
or naval installations or equipment requiring protection against gen-
eral dissemination of information. 18 U.S.C.A. 795. It is also a
crime to publish or disseminate photographs, maps, or drawings of.
such defense installations without first obtaining permission of the
commanding officer or higher authority. 18 U.S.C.A. 797..

--Congress, in order to prevent public disclosure of certain activities,
has given various officials the power to keep confidential certain funds
expended for national security or foreign relations purposes. Such
authority is given, for example, to the President (22 U.S.C.A. 2364),
to the Secretary of State (31U.S.C.A. 107), and to the Director of
Central Intelligence (50) U.S.C.A、403j).
::

NW.88608 DocId:32989532 Page.......

--Congress has provided that meetings of the Senate Committee on
the Budget may be closed to the public if it is determined by a record
vote of a majority of the members that the matter to be discussed

...will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in the
interest of national defense or the confidential conduct of
the foreign relations of the United States. 2U.S.C.A..
190a-3.

--Congress, after requiring that the Secretary of State transmit forth-
with to the Congress the text of any international agreement, other
than a treaty, to which the United States is a party, goes on to pro-
vide that

...any such agreement the immediate public disclosure
of which would, in the opinion of the President, be prej-
udicial to the national security of the United States shall
not be so transmitted to the Congress but shall be trans-
mitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate
and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Rep-
resentatives under an appropriate injunction of secrecy to
be removed only upon due notice from the President.
1U.S.C.A. 112b.

--Finally, Congress, in enacting the Freedom of Information Act,
expressly exempted from disclosure matters which are

...specifically authorized under criteria established
by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest
of national defense or foreign policy. 5U.S.C.A.
552(b)(1).

2. Despite this apparent lack of authority to release classified data
and the existence of the above-mentioned statutes, Congress is constitutionally
immunized, at least in part, against any consequences flowing from release
and disclosure of classified information. Article I, § 6 of the Constitution
states in respect to Senators and Representatives that:

...for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall
not be questioned in any other Place.

NW 88608 Docld:32989532 Page 6
2.

3. A long line of Supreme Court cases, beginning with Kilbourn v.
Thompson, 103 U.S. 168 (1990), has held that the privilege or immunity
relating to speech or debate should be given a broad and liberal construc-
țion, In Kilbourn the court stated:

It would be a narrow view of the Constitutional provision
to limit it to words spoken in debate. The reason of the
rule is as forcible in its application to written reports
presented in that body by its committees, to resolutions
offered, which, though in writing, must be reproduced
in speech, and to the act of voting.... In short, to things
generally done in a session of the House by one of its
members in relation to the business before it. (At p. 204.)
:

4. The court, moreover, has resisted arguments that an unworthy
purpose should destroy the privilege. In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S.
367 the court reaffirmed its earlier holding in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch
87 (1810), stating:

...that it was not consonant with our scheme of govern-
ment for a court to inquire into the motives of legislators,
has remained unquestioned. (At.p. 377.)

The distance to which the court was willing to go to uphold this principle
was seen in United States v. Johnson, 383 U.S. 169 (1966). In that case
a former Congressman was convicted for conspiracy to defraud the U.S.,
in part on evidence that, in pursuance of a conspiracy designed to give
assistance to certain savings and loan associations which had been indicted
en mail fraud charges, he was paid to give a speech on the floor of the House.
The Supreme Court granted a new trial holding that a prosecution which
draws in question the legislative acts of the defendant member of Congress
er his motives for performing them \"necessarily contravenes the Speech or
Debate Clause.\" (At p. 185.)

5. The court addressed the issue of classified information in Gravel v.
United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972), a case which arose when Senator Gravel,
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds of the Senate Public
Works Committee, convened a night meeting of the Subcommittee and there
read extensively from a copy of the Pentagon Papers which bore a Defense
security classification of Top Secret Sensitive. He then placed the entire
47 volumes of the study in the public record. Senator Gravel claimed that
Article I, section 6 protected him from criminal or civil liability and from

NW-88608-DocId:32989532-Page-7-
3

questioning elsewhere than in the Senate, with respect to the events occur-
'ring at the Subcommittee hearing at which the Pentagon Papers were intro-
duced into the public record. The court stated: \".../T/o us this claim is
incontrovertible.\" (Atp. 615.)

6. The court further noted that:

The Speech or Debate Clause was designated to assure
a co-equal branch of the government wide freedom of
speech, debate, and deliberation without intimidation
or threats from the Executive Branch. It thus protects
Members against prosecutions that directly impinge
* upon or threaten the legislative process. We have no
doubt that Senator Gravel may not be made to answer--
either in terms of questions or in terms of defending
himself from prosecution--for the events that occurred
at the subcommittee meeting. (At p. 616.)

7. From the above, together with the positive phrasing of Article 1,
§ 6 of the Constitution, it would appear that any Member may make any state-
ment he desires on the floor of the Congress or in one of its committees. Such
statement shall be absolutely privileged, notwithstanding that it was based
on information secured from classified Central Intelligence Agency material
either furnished the Member in confidence or containing any restrictive
notice as to use or dissemination. This privilege would operate if the Member
were to read the information verbatim into the record on the floor or into
the record of hearings before a congressional committee. It would still be
privileged when it appeared, verbatim, in the Congressional Record or in
the published hearings of a congressional committee. The only sanction,
apart from the individual conscience and sense of responsibility of the Member,
would have to come from Congress itself, which has the power to discipline
any Representative or Senator who improperly disclosed classified information.

8. One additional wrinkle might be noted. Although Congressmen
would be immune from liability for introducing classified information into
a committee report and immune from liability for ordering it printed and
disseminated to the public at large, the Public Printer and the Superintendent
of Documents may not be immune from suit for printing and disseminating
such reports to the public. The court examined this question in Doe v.
McMillan, 412 U.S. 306(1973), a case in which petitioners claimed that a
report issued by the House Committee on the District of Columbia, containing
NW-88608 Docld:32989532 Page 8
4

documents relating to disciplinary problems of certain specifically named
students, violated statutory, constitutional and common-law rights to pri-
vacy. The Supreme Court refused to determine whether dissemination to
the public would serve the important legislative function of informing the
public concerning matters pending before Congress for the purpose of
holding Members of Congress liable. However, it remanded the case to
the Court of Appeals, in part to undertake just such a review in order to
determine whether the Public Printer and the Superintendent of Documents.,
who were without blanket immunity, could be held liable..
:

9. The discussion thus far has dealt only with congressional immunity
for releasing classified information in Congress. No such immunity exists
in the case of disclosures made by congressmen outside of Congress. Thus,
in Long v. Ansel, 69 F.2d 386 (Ct. App., D.C. 1934), affd. 293 U.S. 76
(1934), and in McGovern v. Martz, 182 F. Supp. 343 (US Dist. Ct., D.C..
1960) it was held that if a Senator or Representative is alleged to have com-
mitted libel by republishing and disseminating remarks made in the Congress,
such republication and dissemination is not within the Speech or Debate
privilege even if such privilege would have been applicable to the original
publication of the remarks. Again, in Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606
(1972), and in Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306 (1973) the court noted that
the Speech or Debate Clause does not protect \"à private republication of
documents introduced and made public at a committee hearing, although the
hearing was unquestionably part of the legislative process.\"

10. From the above it is apparent that a Member is not privileged to
circulate CIA documents to his constituents, to the press, or by reading to:
a meeting or on radio or television. Such action could well make the member
liable for prosecution under the espionage laws, but in any event would
expose him to the same liability for these actions as any other citizen. As
a practical matter, however, the prosecution of a Member for unauthorized
disclosure of classified CIA material, or disciplinary action by Congress
itself, is very unlikely.

drills are rarely, if ever, held in communi-
ties or in public buildings (schools are an
exception).
A recent federally sponsored study gives
these estimates of death and injury should
a temblor of more than 7 or 8 on the Rich-
ter scale occur in or near San Francisco or
Los Angeles:
San Francisco-as many as 10,000 persons
dead and 40,000 injured. (Should a major
dam break, the death toll could rise to
60,000.) Another 56,000 could be leit home-
less (not including dam evaulters).
Los Angeles-as many as 20,000 deaths and
up to 600,000 injured. Additional deaths pos-
sible due to major dam failure-up to 14,000.
Homeless (not including dam evacuees), up
to 180,000.
At the very best, Californians are fatalistic
about earthquakes, accepting that they will
come, and hoping they will be out of the
affected area when it happens.
\"You don't know when it is going to be or
how it's going to be,\" said one West Los An-
geles resident. \"I should put money into
making my house earthquake-proof when I
could be in some skyscraper swaying when it
happens? Who cares?\"
In San Francisco, a college professor re-
cently asked 125 residents in a random
sampling what they would do if an earth-
quake comes. Sixty per cent said, in effect,
\"Start praying. What else is there to do?\"
What can be done? In fact, quite a lot-
and some of it is being accomplished in the
areas of building code upgrading, land-use
planning, emergency preparedness, earth-
quake prediction, and public education. But
the effort of a few agressive legislators,
state and local officials, and private citizens
is frustrated by the low level of priority
generally asstened to earthquake protection.
The \"kill ratio\" of past California earth-
quakes is extremely low compared to, say,
traffic accidents. About 000 persons have died
as the results of quakes since the turn of
the century compared to an average annual
highway toll of 4,800. Thus there are those
who argue against expenditures of time and
effort on something as mercurial and unpre-
dictable as an earthquake.
California's new governor, Elmund G.
Brown, Jr., is sald to be one of those. Accord-
ing to a recent news story, Brown surgested
that money being allocated for safe buildings
might be used to improve the quality of edu-
cation, to rehabilitate housing for the poor,
or to create construction Jobs.

GRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATI
After the San Frenando quake, there was
a flurry of studies, hearings, plans and legis-
lation.
In Los Angeles, the building code require-
ments were toughened. Explained Bob Wil-
liams, general manager of Los Angeles' De-
partment of Building and Safety: \"We
doubled the loading strength requirements
and required standards twice as strong in re-
inforced concrete and reinforced masonry.\"
Los Angeles' building code is in some re-
spect tougher than the Uniform Building
Code to which most jurisdictions in the
state adhere. One official, Tong Beach build-
ing director Edward M. O'Connor, a leading
proponent of better preparedness, contends
that the Uniform Building Code falls short.
\"It does not fulfill the purpose of the
code: to preserve life, limb, property and the
public welfare in the event of an earth-
quake,\" he said.
Changes in the uniform code come slowly.
They are modeled after recommendations
by the Callfornia Structural Engineers As-
sociation, composed of professional engineers
who help design buildings.
The recommendations usually represent
a balance of conservative and liberal strains
within the association, and, according to
some observers, are strongly influenced by
economic considerations.
The drafters of the uniform code are still
wrestling with one of the central lessons of
the San Fernando earthquake the fact that
major buildings are being constructed with
little knowledge or consideration of soil and
geological conditions and how they might
respond to ground shocks.
Geologists and seismile experts admit they
know very little about what causes earth-
quakes or precisely how buildings are affected
by local or even distant shocks. Now, for the
first time, California is placing instruments
that measure motion in key buildings
around the state. But they must await an-
other earthquake to produce usable data.
In the meantime, seismic considerations
are working their way slowly-some say too
slowly-into building requirements.
New laws ban construction directly over
active faults, require satisfactory geologic
studies before new hospitals are built, re-
quire that a \"seismic safety element\" be in-
cluded in local planning, and require the
correction of unsafe dam conditions.
This legislation added up to the most pro-
gressive package of earthquake measures in
40 years, but it was not accomplished without
resistance. The restriction on building on or
near faults, for example, inspired a storm of
protest from real estate developers and in-
dividual lot owners that eventually forced
a modification softening the restriction.
A hospital law passed in 1972 requires that
detalled geological and soil reporis for pro-
posed hospital construction be reviewed by
state geologists.
James Flosson, director of the state De-
partment of Mines and Geology, promptly
ran into problems.
\"The reports the first few months were a
disgrace to the profession,\" Flosson said. \"Wo
Insisted that they be redone, and done again
until they were right. I've had my head
bloodied many times as a result. I've been
threatened, told my career would be ruined-
a few geologists tried to get me fired. But we
stood by our guns and now the quality of
the reports is excellent.\"
Another area of controversy is highrise
safety. Berkeley architect Karl V. Steinbrugge
believes the modern steelframe construction
will withstand Intense shocks. But Henry J.
Degunkolb, a San Francisco structural en-
gloser and frequent critle of safety standards,
sald:
\"I would not find it unreasonable to ex-
pect
there will be 15 to 30 total collapses
with another 50 to 100 severely damaged\" in
San Francisco.
While there is disagreement about high-
April 29, 1975
rise collapse, there is a broad consensus that
most existing high rises are vulnerable to ex-
tensive internal damage from unbolted
equipment and, most significantly, from fire.
The dangers are serious enough to have
prompted major changes recently in fire reg-
ulations for all future buildings.
All future high rises (above 75 feet) will be
built with automatic governors that bring
elevators instantly to ground level, and, most
importantly, with sprinkler systems at every
level.
All but a minuscale number of the nearly
2,000 high rises presently in Los Angeles and
San Francisco lack sprinkler systems.
Requirements that they be installed were
written into a state law last year, but efforts
to draft regulations ran into fierce opposition
from builders, the Chambers of Commerce
and other businessmen.
The battle is still being fought.
San Francisco's disaster plan is advanced
over those of other municipalities, but it sui-
fers from lack of a central communications
network, insufficient coordination among de-
partments and inadequate practical exer-
cises, according to a city planning depart-
ment study.
\"All it is is a paper organization,\" said
Alfred Goldberg, head of the city's building
'department.
Goldberg's concerns are echoed by James
Halgwood, state emergency services officer in
charge of helping to create state-level dis-
aster plan for Southern California.
Commented Halgwood: \"I don't think most
elected and appointed officials understand
they have a real responsibility to have their
jurisdictions prepared. They are only doing a
barebones job.\"

The following represents the writer's recollection
of testimony given this date before the Senate Select Committee
(SSC) pursuant to subpoena. The session commenced at 10 a.m.
former
5/21/75 in Room 607, Caroll Arms Hotel.
Present was Senator
Robert Morgan (North Carolina); Lester B. Seidel, Staff Member;
Mr. Jack Smith, Staff Member; Mr. John Bailey, Assistant
Minority Counsel, and a male reporter. Senator Morgan placed
the writer under oath. Approximately four or five minutes later
Senator Morgan excused himself with a general statement to
the effect he had other pressing matters. The entire proceedings
with only two exceptions were conducted by Lester B. Seidel.

Seidel explained the writer was entitled to counsel,
had the privilege of invoking provisions of the Fifth Amendment,
and would have the privilege of making an opening and closing
statement. Seidel inquired whether the writer understood his
Crights and the Committee's rules and regulations, a copy of
which he had made available.

The writer acknowledged receipt of the Committee's
rules and regulations as furnished by Seidel at 9:31 a.m.
5/21/75. He also acknowledged he had been informed of the right
to couriForuminasmuch as this Committee was not understood

to constitute a grand jury and in the absence of any charges
or allegations of a violation of law on his part, he did not
insist on the presence of counsel.
Seidel was advised that
advised as a former Special Agent the
writer had contacted the Bureau's Legal Counsel Division and
as of this date had been advised by Mr. Paul Daly thereof that
he had been cleared by the Attorney General (AG) to testify
to matters relating to investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley
Levison.

\"Seidel was advised that during his interview of the
writer in Atlanta, Georgia, on 5/12/75 he had asked a question
as to how long after the assassination of King did the telephone
surveillance continue on the King residence. On 5/12/75 the
writer responded it was his recollection this coverage continued
until a short time subsequent to the assassination. Following
that interview, the writer recalled that either shortly before
or shortly after that case was assigned to the writer, the King
family had moved from one residence to another and that
continuation of the telephone surveillance from the former
residence to the latter one was not authorized. Secondly,
Seidel on 5/12/75 had asked when the King and SCLC cases were

assigned to the writer, the writer recalled such assignment
was in the early part of 1965; that it was now the writer's
recollection this assignment was made in May, 1965.

Set forth below are questions asked by Seidel (unless
otherwise indicated) and the writer's answers. These questions
and answers are not set forth chronologically.
Q. Why was continuance of the telephone surveillance
not continued to the Kings' new residence?
A.
Continuance was not authorized by the AG.
\"Q. What telephone surveillance was there conducted by
Atlanta of Stanley Levison?
A. There was no such coverage per se only such as afforded
by contacts made of King or members of the SCLC staff by
Levison.

Q. Was there telephone surveillance of Levison in New York?
\"A. Any contacts of King by Levison while in New York would
have been covered.
Q. Did the New York Office maintain telephone surveillance
of Levison?
A.
I do not directly know.
Q. During the Atlanta interview you indicated you had read
New York reports concerning Levison. Is that correct?

A. Yes.
↑ Q. During Atlanta interview you indicated you presumed
these reports set forth information concerning Levison from
a telephone surveillance.
A. Yes.
Is that correct?

Q. What was the basis for your presumption?
A. The appropriate administrative portion of such report
would have so indicated.
Q. What evidence of CP connections did your investigation
develop concerning Levison?
\"A. None.
Q. What information did you have establishing CP connection
re Levison?
A. Such information as was set forth in what was then referred
to as a characterization of Levison. Such characterization was
a part of each report submitted to the Bureau.
Q. What was the nature of this characterization?
A.
I do not remember the precise language. It is my recollection
the statement was brief and set forth information establishing
past and/or present CP affiliation by Levison.
Q. Where did you obtain this characterization?
Α.
A. A characterization of an individual or organization at
that time was prepared by the field office concerned, submitted

to Bureau Headquarters for its approval, and such was made
available to offices having a need-to-know this information.
Q. What was the source of this information regarding Levison.
A.
I do not recall that I was ever, apprised thereof. A
characterization would not indicate the source of the information,
unless public source information was utilized, otherwise the
reliability or lack thereof of the source or sources would be
indicated but not their identity.
\"Q. What prompted you today to amend your answer on May the 12th
75 as to how long telephone surveillance continued on the King
A
residence? Did you seek the advice or an answer from someone?
ONLY
\"A. To the extent that subsequent to May the 12th I conferred
with a former Agent, Charles Harding, prior te

prior to that time-which-it
to that question
had concerned me, that my initial answer for some reason did not
impress me as being completely correct. I mentioned this to
Harding and he informed me that my answer was incorrect and
mentioned the change in the King residence and the fact coverage
had not been thereafter authorized. When he informed me of
this I immediately récalled the change in residence which
previously had escaped my memory.
Q. Why would Harding know this information?

Q.
Is such writing available to this Committee?
A.
I consider it a personal item for my personal use.
I realize that you have the perogative of subpoenaing it.
In the absence thereof, I prefer not to make it available.
\"Q. How long after King's assassination did the telephone
surveillance of SCLC continue?
A. I cannot be certain. It continued for a period of time
which may have been one, two, possibly three months. I simply
do not remember.
Q. Who handled SCLC and Levison case after you left the Bureau?
A. Richard Hamilton.
Q. When did he assume these cases?
\"A. I cannot recall precisely. I am not even sure whether they
had been administratively reassigned to him prior to my departure.
Q. Who else besides Stanley Levison was in contact with King
who you understood to have some type of CP connections?

was none..
Q. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location
to use against King or SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious
entry to obtain it?
A. No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say
this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late
1950s concerning such a technique had changed.
Q. (By.Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy
had changed?

I feel compelled to apologize if I appear particularly

I can offer at this moment is that conceiably some field offices

Following a few very general concluding comments
by Seidel, the writer was given the opportunity to make a
statement. At this point Seidel was advised it was the writer's
understanding that the procedures of this Committee provided for
a witness to subsequently have opportunity to review the transcript
thereof, and that the writer would like to avail himself of
this opportunity. Inquiry was made as to whether this could be
accomplished via registered or certified mail to preclude unnecessary
expense to the Government.

prior to that time-which-it
to that question
had concerned me, that my initial answer for some reason did not
impress me as being completely correct. I mentioned this to
Harding and he informed me that my answer was incorrect and
mentioned the change in the King residence and the fact coverage
had not been thereafter authorized. When he informed me of
this I immediately récalled the change in residence which
previously had escaped my memory.

residence was made?
\"A. He was in a relief supervisory capacity at that time.
Q. Why did you rely on Harding's recollection? Is his recollection
better than yours?

than mine. What he said to me merely served to jog my memory
upon which I based my earlier statement today.

my questions were taken from prepared notes.
A. Yes.
\"Q. You recall that I told you that I would make notes during

notes (to which he answered in the affirmative).
Q. Did you make any recording of that interview at the time?
A. I did not.

In the absence thereof, I prefer not to make it available.

A. To determine communist influence of that organization.
\"Q. What is your recollection of the Bureau's efforts to
influence any political campaign.
۱۰
A. I have no such recollection.

kitchen floor.
Q. Kitchen floor?
A. Yes.
Q. What surreptitious entry was made in respect to the King
residence or SCLC headquarters?

was none..
Q. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location
to use against King or SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious
entry to obtain it?
A. No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say
this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late
1950s concerning such a technique had changed.
Q. (By.Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy
had changed?

activity had to be approved by the Bureau, with reference to

I can offer at this moment is that conceiably some field offices
imtially
other than Atlanta were involved therein. If this was the
case, Atlanta may well have been included therein subsequent

Following a few very general concluding comments
by Seidel, the writer was given the opportunity to make a
statement. At this point Seidel was advised it was the writer's
understanding that the procedures of this Committee provided for
a witness to subsequently have opportunity to review the transcript
thereof, and that the writer would like to avail himself of
this opportunity. Inquiry was made as to whether this could be
accomplished via registered or certified mail to preclude unnecessary
expense to the Government.

had concerned me, that my initial answer for some reason did not
impress me as being completely correct. I mentioned this to

kitchen floor.

Q. Kitchen floor?
A. Yes.

Q. What surreptitious entry was made in respect to the King
residence or SCLC headquarters?

Q. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location
to use against King or SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious
entry to obtain it?
A. No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say
this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late
1950s concerning such a technique had changed.

Q. (By.Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy
had changed?

May 21, 1975

The following represents the writer's recollection of testimony given this date before the Senate Select Committee (SSC) pursuant to subpoena. The session commenced at 10 a.m. former 5/21/75 in Room 607, Caroll Arms Hotel.
Present was Senator Robert Morgan (North Carolina); Lester B. Seidel, Staff Member; Mr. Jack Smith, Staff Member; Mr. John Bailey, Assistant Minority Counsel, and a male reporter. Senator Morgan placed the writer under oath. Approximately four or five minutes later Senator Morgan excused himself with a general statement to the effect he had other pressing matters. The entire proceedings with only two exceptions were conducted by Lester B. Seidel.

Seidel explained the writer was entitled to counsel, had the privilege of invoking provisions of the Fifth Amendment, and would have the privilege of making an opening and closing statement. Seidel inquired whether the writer understood his rights and the Committee's rules and regulations, a copy of which he had made available.

The writer acknowledged receipt of the Committee's rules and regulations as furnished by Seidel at 9:31 a.m. 5/21/75. He also acknowledged he had been informed of the right to counsel but inasmuch as this Committee was not understood

to constitute a grand jury and in the absence of any charges or allegations of a violation of law on his part, he did not insist on the presence of counsel.

Seidel was advised as a former Special Agent the writer had contacted the Bureau's Legal Counsel Division and as of this date had been advised by Mr. Paul Daly thereof that he had been cleared by the Attorney General (AG) to testify to matters relating to investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr., Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison.

\"Seidel was advised that during his interview of the writer in Atlanta, Georgia, on 5/12/75 he had asked a question as to how long after the assassination of King did the telephone surveillance continue on the King residence. On 5/12/75 the writer responded it was his recollection this coverage continued until a short time subsequent to the assassination. Following that interview, the writer recalled that either shortly before or shortly after that case was assigned to the writer, the King family had moved from one residence to another and that continuation of the telephone surveillance from the former residence to the latter one was not authorized. Secondly, Seidel on 5/12/75 had asked when the King and SCLC cases were

assigned to the writer, the writer recalled such assignment was in the early part of 1965; that it was now the writer's recollection this assignment was made in May, 1965.

Q. Can you give an example of such reference?

A. There is only one particular conversation that comes to mind at the moment and I have no recollection with whom the conversation was held during which reference was made to a wonderful sermon they had preached together on somebody's kitchen floor.

Q. Kitchen floor?

A. Yes.

Q. What surreptitious entry was made in respect to the King residence or SCLC headquarters?

A. During the period I was concerned with these cases there was none..

Q. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location to use against King or SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious entry to obtain it?

A. No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late 1950s concerning such a technique had changed.

Q. (By.Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy had changed?

A. During my period with the Bureau, from the beginning, such activity had to be approved by the Bureau, with reference to the period of time the policy had changed to the extent that obtaining authority was virtually impossible.

Q. Prior to 1965 in what way. were you involved in any surreptitious entry?

A. Mr. Seidel, as I stated earlier I have been informed that I was released by the AG to testify before this Committee concerning King, SCLC, Stanley Levison, and matters related thereto.

Q. Did you develop any information establishing CP connection on the part of King?

A. Not beyond his affiliation with Levison and the other individuals previously mentioned.

YQ. What was the objective of the investigation of King and SCLC?

A. To determine possible communist influence of King and SCLC.

Q. If, as you state, you did not develop information that King was a communist, was not this investigation in vain?

\"A. Not in my opinion. It is correct it did not establish that King was a CP member. It did establish that he was in contact with individuals then having past or present CP affiliation which was the objective of the investigation.
See ITEM III. of attached pages.

Q. Do you remember during 1963 King alleged that Bureau Agents were not responsive to civil rights complaints in the vicinity of Albany, Georgia, and other South Georgia locations?

A. Yes, I recall news media information concerning such allegations.

Q. In response to these allegations by King, do you remember that Mr. Hoover became very concerned with King's allegations?

the
A. Yes. I definitely remember news media indicating that Mr. Hoover was extremely upset.

Q. You have stated you were assigned to King and SCLC case in May, 1965, is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You previously stated these cases were initiated 12 months or perhaps a little longer prior to your receiving them. Is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Was there not then a connection between Director Hoover's concern with King's statements in 1963 regarding lack of attention to civil rights matters in South Georgia by the Bureau and the initiation of the investigation of King and SCLC?

A. Yes
I did not discuss that matter with Mr. Hoover or with any Bureau official..

Q. Do you deny there was any such connection?

A. I cannot deny that there might have been such a connection. This was a situation in which I recall the news media on more than one occasion suggested such to be the case.

Q. From 1965 until 1971 was there any electronic surveillance of any other individual or organization in addition to King, SCLC, and SNCC?

A. To the best of my recollection there were none except as may have pertained to some strictly criminal investigations with which I had no connection.

Q. What about prior to 1965?

A. There was one concerning an individual or individuals having KLAN-King connections believed to have been involved in an earlier church bombing, I believe in Birmingham, involving the death of several children.

\"Q. During our interview in Atlanta you stated you did not have any contact with members of the news media or clergy regarding King or SCLC. Is that correct?

A. Yes, I did not have any such contact.

५९. What discussion was had with members of the Atlanta Police Department concerning King, SCLC, and Levison, and what was the extent of their electronic coverage regarding these matters?

- A. During the period of time I was concerned with King, SCLC, Levison, I had no discussion with any member of the Atlanta Police Department concerning these matters. Bureau instructions regarding these matters or that any discussion was on a strictly need-to-know basis and I have absolutely no recollection that members of the Atlanta Police Department fitted into this category.

I do not have any knowledge as to what electronic surveillance may ever have been conducted by the Atlanta Police Department.

Q. While in Atlanta you were assigned to what was referred to as the Security and Racial Squad, is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Essentially this squad was concerned with security matters, racial matters, is that correct?

A. Yes and it was also concerned with civil rights violations and election law violations.

Q. In regard to civil rights and election law matters, did you ever develop any information pertinent to the CP?

A. No.

Q. What Agents do you remember were assigned to that squad? Charles Harding, Arthur Murtagh?

A. Yes. Those two, Alden Miller, Richard Hamilton, Richard Davis, Donald Burgess, Randall McGough, Timothy Dorsch, Charles Haynes.

Q. Who monitored the King and SCLC surveillance?

A. A number of different gentlemen, some of whom were periodically transferred.

Q. Who were some of those?

A. Donald Burgess, Richard Davis, Brian O'Shea, now deceased.

Q. Who served in a supervisory capacity before Charles Harding?

\"A. Henry Rouse.

Q. Where is he now?

A. I understand he retired, I do not know where he is located.

Q. What was your involvement with the Bureau's program referred toras COINTELPRO?

A. Mr. Seidel, as I endeavored to explain on May 12, your use of that particular terminology did not register with me at all.

\"Q. Recently testimony was given be one or more Bureau officials indicating this program began during the late 1950s and continued to a fairly recent date. Did not your reports regarding King, SCLC, or Levison include in their caption COINTELPRO?

A. It is not my recollection that they did.

'Q. What about a Klan organization?

A. I did at various times handle investigations concerning individual Klan members. I'did not handle the Klan as an organizational matter. It is my recollection that in reporting on the activities of an individual Klan member the character of the case would have been indicated as Ku Klux Klan Racial Matter.

I feel compelled to apologize if I appear particularly dense as to the utilization of this phrase COINTELPRO. If it was a program operating over a period of years the only explanati on I can offer at this moment is that conceiably some field offices other than Atlanta were involved therein. If this was the case, Atlanta may well have been included therein subsequent to my departure.

Q. (John Bailey) When the telephone surveillance was discontinued on the King residence and on SCLC who took care of that.

A. I do not know.

It should be noted the Committee took a five minute break approximately 12:05 to 12:10 p.m. ofter which questioning Continued.

Following a few very general concluding comments by Seidel, the writer was given the opportunity to make a statement. At this point Seidel was advised it was the writer's understanding that the procedures of this Committee provided for a witness to subsequently have opportunity to review the transcript thereof, and that the writer would like to avail himself of this opportunity. Inquiry was made as to whether this could be accomplished via registered or certified mail to preclude unnecessary expense to the Government.

Seidel responded at some length referring to (Section 6b?) of the Committee's rules and regulations which permitted

such review in the Committee's office. Any expense thereof to be borne by the witness. He explained it was not his perogative to amend the Committee's rules and regulations.

The writer apologized for asking the question and submitted that had he been furnished a copy of the Committee's rules and regulations for a period of time longer than 29 minutes before this Committee convened, it would not have been necessary to have asked the question.

The aforementioned session terminated shortly past 1 p.m.

Q.
Is such writing available to this Committee?
A.
I consider it a personal item for my personal use.
I realize that you have the perogative of subpoenaing it.
In the absence thereof, I prefer not to make it available.
\"Q. How long after King's assassination did the telephone
surveillance of SCLC continue?
A. I cannot be certain. It continued for a period of time
which may have been one, two, possibly three months. I simply
do not remember.
い
Q. Who handled SCLC and Levison case after you left the Bureau?
A. Richard Hamilton.
Q. When did he assume these cases?
\"A. I cannot recall precisely. I am not even sure whether they
had been administratively reassigned to him prior to my departure.
Q. Who else besides Stanley Levison was in contact with King
who you understood to have some type of CP connections?
A. There was Hunter Pitts O'Dell, Bayard Rustin, and Harry
Wachtel.

A. It did not develop any such information.
Q. How did you know of whatever their CP affiliation may
have been?
A.
In the same manner as in regard to Levison.
\"Q. What investigation did Atlanta conduct of O'Dell, Rustin,
and Wachtel?
\"A. There was no active ongoing investigation conducted of
these individuals other than during such periods when they were
in contact with King or members of SCLCX

residence or on such occasions when she might have been present
in SCLC headquarters.

airtels, letters, memoranda?
A.
I am certain there were airtels, letters, possibly
teletypes in the file..
g
Q. What was the fist of such communications?
\"A. Advisement that such installation had been authorized,
instructions to initiate the coverage.
1
Q. Who installed the surveillances, Al Miller; was he not a
technician, a wireman?
A. Your answer to that question is not entirely correct.
Alden Miller was an Atlanta Agent who had certain technical
ability. It is my recollection the surveillance was installed
by an Agent who was not from the Atlanta Office. I do not
remember his name.
Q. Did you monitor any of these surveillances?
\"A. No.
Q. Did you monitor any such surveillance during this period
of time?
A. Yes. I recall on two occasions filling in for another

I did not monitor the King or SCLC telephone surveillance.
Q. What was the nature of the investigation of SNCC?

To determine communist influence of that organization.
A.
\"Q. What is your recollection of the Bureau's efforts to
influence any political campaign.
۱۰
A. I have no such recollection.
\"Q. What about efforts to disrupt the political campaign of
Senator Andrew Young?

during this period?
A. There were two Sullivans in an official capacity with the
Bureau.

which we are presently concerned.

Q. Can you give an example of such reference?
A. There is only one particular conversation that comes to
mind at the moment and I have no recollection with whom the
conversation was held during which reference was made to a
wonderful sermon they had preached together on somebody's
kitchen floor.
Q. Kitchen floor?
A. Yes.
Q. What surreptitious entry was made in respect to the King
residence or SCLC headquarters?
A. During the period I was concerned with these cases there
was none..
Q. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location
to use against King or SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious
entry to obtain it?
A. No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say
this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late
1950s concerning such a technique had changed.
Q. (By.Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy
had changed?
A. During my period with the Bureau, from the beginning, such
activity had to be approved by the Bureau, with reference to

concerning King, SCLC, Stanley Levison, and matters related
thereto.
Q. Did you develop any information establishing CP connection
on the part of King?
A. Not beyond his affiliation with Levison and the other
individuals previously mentioned.
YQ. What was the objective of the investigation of King and

SCLC?

Q. If, as you state, you did not develop information that King
was a communist, was not this investigation in vain?
\"A. Not in my opinion. It is correct it did not establish that
King was a CP member.
It did establish that he was in contact
with individuals then having past or present CP affiliation which

concern with King's statements in 1963 regarding lack of
attention to civil rights matters in South Georgia by the Bureau
and the initiation of the investigation of King and SCLC?

I did not discuss that matter with Mr. Hoover or
any Bureau official..

members of the Atlanta Police Department fitted into this category.

In regard to civil rights and election law matters, did
you ever develop any information pertinent to the CP?

A.
I understand he retired, I do not know where he is located.
Q. What was your involvement with the Bureau's program referred
toras COINTELPRO?
A. Mr. Seidel, as I endeavored to explain on May 12, your
use of that particular terminology did not register with me
at all.
\"Q. Recently testimony was given be one or more Bureau officials
1
indicating this program began during the late 1950s and
continued to a fairly recent date. Did not your reports
regarding King, SCLC, or Levison include in their caption
COINTELPRO?
A.
It is not my recollection that they did.
'Q. What about a Klan organization?
A.
I did at various times handle investigations concerning
individual Klan members. I'did not handle the Klan as an
organizational matter. It is my recollection that in reporting
on the activities of an individual Klan member the character
of the case would have been indicated as Ku Klux Klan Racial
Matter.

I can offer at this moment is that conceiably some field offices
imtially
other than Atlanta were involved therein. If this was the
case, Atlanta may well have been included therein subsequent
to my departure.
Q. (John Bailey) When the telephone surveillance was discontinued
on the King residence and on SCLC who took care of that.

It should be noted the Committee took a five minute
break approximately 12:05 to 12:10 p.m. ofter which questioning.

Following a few very general concluding comments
by Seidel, the writer was given the opportunity to make a
statement. At this point Seidel was advised it was the writer's
understanding that the procedures of this Committee provided for
a witness to subsequently have opportunity to review the transcript
thereof, and that the writer would like to avail himself of
this opportunity. Inquiry was made as to whether this could be
accomplished via registered or certified mail to preclude unnecessary
expense to the Government.

ON AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT NATIONAL SECURITY
INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

ecurity Juridiction

The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize investigative
efforts to authenticate Hoover memoranda dated 8/24-25/36.

Document Section, FBI Laboratory, determined the type appearing
on Hoover memorandum dated 8/25/36 was prepared on a Remington typewriter
with an elite type used since October, 1935. Hoover memorandum to Tamm dated
9/10/36, was prepared on an IBM typewriter with pica-style type used since 1930.

The letterhead used on both Hoover memoranda of 8/24-25/36 was
authorized FBI stationery effective August 14, 1936.

On 3/10/75, Mr. Donald B. Schewe, Assistant Librarian, Reference
Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, New York, advised that
The White House Ushers Appointment Book contained entries showing that
on Thursday, August 24, 1936, from 9:20 a.m. to 10:12 a.m., President
Roosevelt met with Mr. Hoover in his residence at The White House prior to
leaving for his office. Schewe pointed out that this meeting was significant
since President Roosevelt met Mr. Hoover immediately after returning from
an extended trip, a departure from his usual practice. There was no entry
on 8/25/36, other than the President's departure for the Dakotas at 10:40 p.m.

On 4/2/75, review of Cordell Hull Papers, Library of Congress,
reflected that a Desk Diary (container #68, folder #295, microfilm #38) of
Secretary Hull contained an entry on 8/25/36 that the Secretary had luncheon
with the President between 1:00p.m. to 3:15 p.m.

Detailed memorandum attached.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TAMM
FROM JOHN EDGAR HOOVER
DATED SEPTEMBER 10, 1936;
CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM BY
February 27, 1975

JOHN EDGAR HOOVER DATED AUGUST 25, 1936.

On this date, SA Alonzo L. Lacey of the Intelligence
Division delivered the above-captioned memoranda to the Laboratory
with a request to determine the make of typewriter employed in
the preparation of the memoranda and the date of introduction
of the type styles employed. The purpose of this investigation
was to ascertain whether or not the type styles on the typewriters
used to write the memoranda were in use on the dates appearing
on the memoranda.

It was determined that the \"Memorandum For Mr. Tamm
from John Edgar Hoover dated September 10, 1936\" was prepared
on an IBM typewriter equipped with a pica style of type which
has been in use since 1930. The typewriting comprising the
\"Confidential Memorandum by John Edgar Hoover dated August 25,
1936\" was determined to have been prepared on a Remington
typewriter equipped with an elite style of type that has been in
use since October, 1935.
:
The memoranda were returned to SA Lacey.:

RECOMMENDATION:

The result of this examination be forwarded to the

RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT FRANKLIN D.
ROOSEVELT LIBRARY, HYDE PARK, NY
ON 3/10-12/75

On 3/10/74, Mr. DONALD B. SCHEWE, Assistant
Librarian in the Reference Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt
Library, Hyde Park, NY, was advised of our interest in
locating any communications bearing upon a conversation.
between former President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT and former
Secretary of State CORDELL HULL in the latter part of
August, 1936. Mr. SCHEWE was advised that this conversation
was concerned with the security of the US and that Mr. J.
EDGAR HOOVER of the FBI may have participated in this
conversation. Mr. SCHEWE was also advised that Mr. ROOSEVELT
allegedly reduced the subject matter of above conversation
to a memorandum and that we were interested in locating.
this memorandum or some information bearing upon above
conversation. Arrangements were made to meet with Mr. SCHEWE
at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, NY,
on 3/12/75. Mr. SCHEWE indicated that in the meantime
he would conduct some research in this matter.

On 3/12/75, Mr. SCHEWE advised that he had
conducted some research relative to our telephone call
on 3/10/75, and inquired if we could be more specific
with regard to the dates of the information desired.
\"SCHEWE was advised that to the best of our knowledge the
conversation we were interested in involving FRANKLIN D.
ROOSEVELT (FDR), HULL and Mr. HOOVER, occurred on
approximately 8/24-26/36 and that the conversation concerned
the internal security of the US.
:
::
Mr. SCHEWE, at this point, furnished a Xerox
copy of a \"buck slip\" dated 8/24/36, (copy of which is
attached) on White House stationery, classified \"Confidential
and addressed to the Secretary of State from FDR\".
Mr. SCHEWE stated that \"buck slips\" are nothing more
than a cover memorandum utilized to transmit communications
which are attached thereto. It is to be noted that this
\"buck slip\" indicates that attached to it was a memorandum
for the Secretary of State, unsigned, undated and
recommending coordination of activities of all agents
of the Government in foreign countries. SCHEWE advised
NW-88608 Docld:32989628 Page.10
62-7163.95-
ENCLOSURE
that the synopsis of this memorandum which appears on.
the \"buck slip\" was the usual practice at that time to
identify the documents attached to it. SCHEWE added.
that this was the only document he was able to locate
which may have some bearing on the desired information.
SCHEWE stated that the possibility exists that the
referred to memorandum may be located among the collection
of papers of CORDELL HULL which are now stored at the
Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

Mr. SCHEWE then exhibited to interviewing personnel
the White House Ushers Appointment Book which was
hand-written and kept on a daily basis. This appointment
book contained the following pertinent information:

Thursday, August 13, 1936, at 9:50 AM
FDR departed the White House for a visit
to the flood areas in NY, Ohio and Pennsyl-
vania.

Thursday, August 24, 1936, FDR returned
to White House at 8:45 AM.
9:20 AM FDR met with Mr. HOOVER from
9:20 AM to 10:12 AM.
-
(Note * There is no entry in this book
for Aug. 24, 1936, indicating that Mr.
HULL was there. Mr. SCHEWE advised that
it is interesting to note that. FDR met
Mr. HOOVER in his residence in the White
House on 8/24/36, prior to leaving for
his office in the White House. SCHEWE
also pointed out that this meeting was
significant since FDR met with Mr. HOOVER
on 8/24/36, immediately after returning
from an extended trip. This, according
to SCHEWE was a departure from FDR's
usual practice.

There was no record in the White House
Usher's Appointment Book for 8/25/36, which would indicate
that FDR met with either Mr. HULL or Mr. HOOVER on that
date. This book indicates that FDR departed the White
House on Tuesday, 8,/25/75, at 10:40 PM for a trip to the
draught areas, in upper Maine, South Dakota and North
NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 11

that the synopsis of this memorandum which appears on.
the \"buck slip\" was the usual practice at that time to

that this was the only document he was able to locate

Dakota, as well as a visit to Mt. Rushmore. FDR did not
return to the White House until Sunday, Sept. 6, 1936,
at 10:02 AM.

The White House Usher's Appointment Book
further reflects that FDR, during the period July 10,
1936, to Aug. 10, 1936, was away from the White House
campaigning. FDR returned to the White House on
8/10/36, and remained there until 8/13/36, when he
again departed on a trip and returned on 8/24/36.
FDR also departed from the White House on 8/25/36,
and returned on 9/6/36.

Mr. SCHEWE also produced to interviewing
personnel the appointment book of FDR's private secretary,
GRACE TULLY for the pertinent period. This appointment book
reflects all of FDR's office appointments. A review
of this appointment book fails to reflect that FDR met
or had an appointment with Mr. HOOVER in his office
during the period 8/13/36 to 9/6/36. However, this
appointment book does reflect that during this period
FDR did have a meeting with CORDELL HULL on 8/25/36,
at 1:00 PM.
:

Mr. SCHEWE further advised that he personally
reviewed the following and was unable to locate any
documents or references which could possibly shed some
light on the matter of interest to us:

1.) Papers kept in FDR's safe.

2.) Papers kept by his secretary in a separate
White House safe.

3.) Papers kept in FDR's official presidential
file.

4.) Papers kept in FDR's alphabetical file
maintained by his secretary..

5.) Individual agencies files.

6.) J. EDGAR HOOVER'S file.

NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 12

7.) Attorney General's file.

8.) Assistant Attorney General's file.

9.) National Security file.

10.) Internal Security file.

11.) FBI file.

In conclusion, Mr.SCHEWE stated that after
reviewing all of the above data, he concluded that the
pertinent document of interest to us is not at the FDR
Library at Hyde Park, NY. SCHEWE added that if any
such document is at the Library, it is misfiled and
as there are approximately 21 million pages of manuscripts
and documents at the Library, it would be impossible
to locate same.
:
:
It is to be noted that on the enclosed
\"buck slip\" there are four penciled notations, i.e.
285-C, X20, X285 and X67. SCHEWE stated that these
notaions are part of the FDR Library cross-reference
system. SCHEWE added that he checked these references
and could locate nothing further regarding the matter
of interest to us. SCHEWE stated that these references
pertained to the enclosed \"buck slip\".

The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize investigative
efforts to authenticate Hoover memoranda dated 8/24-25/36.

Document Section, FBI Laboratory, determined the type appearing
on Hoover memorandum dated 8/25/36 was prepared on a Remington typewriter
with an elite type used since October, 1935. Hoover memorandum to Tamm dated
9/10/36, was prepared on an IBM typewriter with pica-style type used since 1930.

The letterhead used on both Hoover memoranda of 8/24-25/36 was
authorized FBI stationery effective August 14, 1936.

On 3/10/75, Mr. Donald B. Schewe, Assistant Librarian, Reference
Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, New York, advised that
The White House Ushers Appointment Book contained entries showing that
on Thursday, August 24, 1936, from 9:20 a.m. to 10:12 a.m., President
Roosevelt met with Mr. Hoover in his residence at The White House prior to
leaving for his office. Schewe pointed out that this meeting was significant
since President Roosevelt met Mr. Hoover immediately after returning from
an extended trip, a departure from his usual practice. There was no entry
on 8/25/36, other than the President's departure for the Dakotas at 10:40 p.m.

On 4/2/75, review of Cordell Hull Papers, Library of Congress,
reflected that a Desk Diary (container #68, folder #295, microfilm #38) of
Secretary Hull contained an entry on 8/25/36 that the Secretary had luncheon
with the President between 1:00p.m. to 3:15 p.m.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TAMM
FROM JOHN EDGAR HOOVER
DATED SEPTEMBER 10, 1936;
CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM BY
February 27, 1975
JOHN EDGAR HOOVER DATED AUGUST 25, 1936.

On this date, SA Alonzo L. Lacey of the Intelligence
Division delivered the above-captioned memoranda to the Laboratory
with a request to determine the make of typewriter employed in
the preparation of the memoranda and the date of introduction
of the type styles employed. The purpose of this investigation
was to ascertain whether or not the type styles on the typewriters
used to write the memoranda were in use on the dates appearing
on the memoranda.

It was determined that the \"Memorandum For Mr. Tamm
from John Edgar Hoover dated September 10, 1936\" was prepared
on an IBM typewriter equipped with a pica style of type which
has been in use since 1930. The typewriting comprising the
\"Confidential Memorandum by John Edgar Hoover dated August 25,
1936\" was determined to have been prepared on a Remington
typewriter equipped with an elite style of type that has been in
use since October, 1935.
:
The memoranda were returned to SA Lacey.:

RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT FRANKLIN D.
ROOSEVELT LIBRARY, HYDE PARK, NY
ON 3/10-12/75

On 3/10/74, Mr. DONALD B. SCHEWE, Assistant
Librarian in the Reference Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt
Library, Hyde Park, NY, was advised of our interest in
locating any communications bearing upon a conversation.
between former President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT and former
Secretary of State CORDELL HULL in the latter part of
August, 1936. Mr. SCHEWE was advised that this conversation
was concerned with the security of the US and that Mr. J.
EDGAR HOOVER of the FBI may have participated in this
conversation. Mr. SCHEWE was also advised that Mr. ROOSEVELT
allegedly reduced the subject matter of above conversation
to a memorandum and that we were interested in locating.
this memorandum or some information bearing upon above
conversation. Arrangements were made to meet with Mr. SCHEWE
at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, NY,
on 3/12/75. Mr. SCHEWE indicated that in the meantime
he would conduct some research in this matter.
L

On 3/12/75, Mr. SCHEWE advised that he had
conducted some research relative to our telephone call
on 3/10/75, and inquired if we could be more specific
with regard to the dates of the information desired.
\"SCHEWE was advised that to the best of our knowledge the
conversation we were interested in involving FRANKLIN D.
ROOSEVELT (FDR), HULL and Mr. HOOVER, occurred on
approximately 8/24-26/36 and that the conversation concerned
the internal security of the US.
:
::

Mr. SCHEWE, at this point, furnished a Xerox
copy of a \"buck slip\" dated 8/24/36, (copy of which is
attached) on White House stationery, classified \"Confidential
and addressed to the Secretary of State from FDR\".
Mr. SCHEWE stated that \"buck slips\" are nothing more
than a cover memorandum utilized to transmit communications
which are attached thereto. It is to be noted that this
\"buck slip\" indicates that attached to it was a memorandum
for the Secretary of State, unsigned, undated and
recommending coordination of activities of all agents
of the Government in foreign countries. SCHEWE advised
NW-88608 Docld:32989628 Page.10
62-7163.95-
ENCLOSURE

that the synopsis of this memorandum which appears on.
the \"buck slip\" was the usual practice at that time to
identify the documents attached to it. SCHEWE added.
that this was the only document he was able to locate
which may have some bearing on the desired information.
SCHEWE stated that the possibility exists that the
referred to memorandum may be located among the collection
of papers of CORDELL HULL which are now stored at the
Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

Mr. SCHEWE then exhibited to interviewing personnel
the White House Ushers Appointment Book which was
hand-written and kept on a daily basis. This appointment
book contained the following pertinent information:

Thursday, August 13, 1936, at 9:50 AM
FDR departed the White House for a visit
to the flood areas in NY, Ohio and Pennsyl-
vania.

Thursday, August 24, 1936, FDR returned
to White House at 8:45 AM.
9:20 AM FDR met with Mr. HOOVER from
9:20 AM to 10:12 AM.
-

(Note * There is no entry in this book
for Aug. 24, 1936, indicating that Mr.
HULL was there. Mr. SCHEWE advised that
it is interesting to note that. FDR met
Mr. HOOVER in his residence in the White
House on 8/24/36, prior to leaving for
his office in the White House. SCHEWE
also pointed out that this meeting was
significant since FDR met with Mr. HOOVER
on 8/24/36, immediately after returning
from an extended trip. This, according
to SCHEWE was a departure from FDR's
usual practice.

There was no record in the White House
Usher's Appointment Book for 8/25/36, which would indicate
that FDR met with either Mr. HULL or Mr. HOOVER on that
date. This book indicates that FDR departed the White
House on Tuesday, 8,/25/75, at 10:40 PM for a trip to the
draught areas, in upper Maine, South Dakota and North
NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 11

Dakota, as well as a visit to Mt. Rushmore. FDR did not
return to the White House until Sunday, Sept. 6, 1936,
at 10:02 AM.

The White House Usher's Appointment Book
further reflects that FDR, during the period July 10,
1936, to Aug. 10, 1936, was away from the White House
campaigning. FDR returned to the White House on
8/10/36, and remained there until 8/13/36, when he
again departed on a trip and returned on 8/24/36.
FDR also departed from the White House on 8/25/36,
and returned on 9/6/36.

Mr. SCHEWE also produced to interviewing
personnel the appointment book of FDR's private secretary,
GRACE TULLY for the pertinent period. This appointment book
reflects all of FDR's office appointments. A review
of this appointment book fails to reflect that FDR met
or had an appointment with Mr. HOOVER in his office
during the period 8/13/36 to 9/6/36. However, this
appointment book does reflect that during this period
FDR did have a meeting with CORDELL HULL on 8/25/36,
at 1:00 PM.
:

Mr. SCHEWE further advised that he personally
reviewed the following and was unable to locate any
documents or references which could possibly shed some
light on the matter of interest to us:

1.) Papers kept in FDR's safe.
..

2.) Papers kept by his secretary in a separate
White House safe.

3.) Papers kept in FDR's official presidential
file.

4.) Papers kept in FDR's alphabetical file
maintained by his secretary..

5.) Individual agencies filės.

6.) J. EDGAR HOOVER'S file.
NW 88608 Docld:32989628 Page 12
3

7.) Attorney General's file.

8.) Assistant Attorney General's file.

9.) National Security file.

10.) Internal Security file.

11.) FBI file.

In conclusion, Mr.SCHEWE stated that after
reviewing all of the above data, he concluded that the
pertinent document of interest to us is not at the FDR
Library at Hyde Park, NY. SCHEWE added that if any
such document is at the Library, it is misfiled and
as there are approximately 21 million pages of manuscripts
and documents at the Library, it would be impossible
to locate same.
:
:

It is to be noted that on the enclosed
\"buck slip\" there are four penciled notations, i.e.
285-C, X20, X285 and X67. SCHEWE stated that these
notaions are part of the FDR Library cross-reference
system. SCHEWE added that he checked these references
and could locate nothing further regarding the matter
of interest to us. SCHEWE stated that these references
pertained to the enclosed \"buck slip\".

On 2/6/75 Mr. Kelley and I met with Senator Church
and Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee.
Senator Church pointed out that he intended to run the Committee in
a very responsible manner, had no intention of destroying or impairing
the effectiveness of the intelligence community and, in fact, hoped that
the efforts of the Committee would help to reestablish public confidence
in the intelligence agencies.

Parameters have not been drawn but Senator Church feels that
the Committee will confine its activities largely to inquiries into domestic

SUBJECT: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM,
INTERNAL SECURITY,
DISRUPTION OF HATE GROUPS

Re Bureau letter to Atlanta dated 9-2-64.

To implement a counterintelligence program as
outlined in referenced letter, this office has been and will
continue to penetrate klan and hate organizations with
continued informant coverage. This is the first step to learn
the complete organizational structure, members, their activities,
sympathizers and followers, action they plan, including actions
of violence and distruction of property.
:
Once their activities, etc., are determined through
informant coverage proper action can be taken to disrupt and
neutralize their activities and efforts can be directed to
frustrate their plans. In addition, those specifically
responsible for unlawful actions are determined through informant.
coverage.

Informant coverage will be specifically concentrated
on the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan since this is the
largest and most important of the klan groups in Mississippi.
Other pertinent organizations considered for counterintelligence
action are:

Mississippi Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
United Klans of America, Inc.,
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Americans for the Preservation of the White Race.

NW 88608 Docld:32989629 Page 5
......

The pertinent individuals to first consider are the
They

are:
:
SAMUEL BOWERS, Laurel Mississippi, Imperial Wizard
JULIUS HARPER, Crystal Springs, Mississippi, Grand
Dragon
BILLY BUCKLES; Roxie, Mississippi, Grand Giant
A.-C. HARRINGTON, Ruth, Mississippi, State Organizer
ERNEST GILBERT, Brookhaven, Mississippi, Chief of
the Klans Bureau of Investigation(KBI)
PAUL FOSTER, Natchez, Mississippi, State Chaplain
ACE WEATHERS, Hattiesburg; Mississippi, Contact
Leader for the County and Secretary

Informant coverage will be supplemented by technical
installations where practical. Specifically, it has been
learned through an informant that a klan group holds meetings
in a building especially built for this purpose in Copiah
County. These meetings are held on a weekly basis. The
building is in a rural area several miles from the nearest town
and has access by only one road. During meetings guards are
placed at strategic points outside the building to insure
complete privacy. An appropriate survey is being made to
determine the feasibility of a technical installation in this
building. The Bureau will be advised by separate communication
regarding this. Other logical points are being determined for
this type of coverage.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE ACTION

1. Liaison is established with the governor's office
to bring pressure to bear on local officials, such as mayors,
chiefs of police, sheriffs, etc., to solve recent bombings,
church burnings, and other acts of violence.

EXAMPLE:

Jackson teletype to the Bureau dated 10-21-54
captioned UNSUBS; EXPLOSION ON LAWN OF RESIDENCE OF MATOR
JOHN NOSSER, NATCHEZ, MISSISSIPPI, 9-25-64, stated that an
Investigator of the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol(MHSP)
advised he was instructed by Governor PAUL-BJOHNSON to
inform Adams-County Sheriff ODELL-ANDERS that the governor
was seriously considering sending the National Guard into
Adass County to close down all gambling and liquor activity
in the county. Sheriff -ANDERS advised he is in the process
of contacting all gambling and liquor establishments in Adams
County to inform operators that if pertinent information regarding
Natchez bombings are not in his possession by October 15 he
will close all such establishments on October 16..

The Jackson Office will, in each instant that presents
itself in other localities and counties, arrange for similar
action and follow through on each.

2. Repeated contacts and constant interviews of
known and suspected klan members are being conducted each
Saturday. This has been done since July, 1964, and is being
continued. This has a three fold purpose. It lets the klansmen
know the FBI is interested and will be around. It also enables
FBI to know their whereabouts on that day, become better
acquainted with their habits and gain more background information
regarding the person being interviewed. In several instances
during such interviews it has been possible to convert certain
klensmen into informants. During interviews of klansmen who
are completely unco-operative and who want to know how we got
their name and why they are being interviewed we can flip
through the cards and pick out a name of another klansman who
is completely unco-operative. This is a disruptive tactic
which can breed suspicion among themselves.

3. Consideration is being gien to invite the State
Police to make raids at known klan meetings.
The 2000 a
of course, will not be invited to participate since
most likely in on the klan meetings. MHS? Investigators at
McComb have indicated they seemed interested in this sort of
thing and it is believed this will have the backing of the
governor since he has indicated such to them. This type of
thing, of course, will be used at places where technical
installations are not feasible or productive.

4. Will participate with the governor in press
releases on the arrests of klansmen when appropriate. This
has been done in the recent arrests in McComb, Mississippi,
in connnection with recent bombings in that area.
..
2.

5. Information has been developed through an informant
that a faction of the klan is interested in putting another
man in office rather than the present person. More information
is being obtained on this so as to exploit all possibilities
and create dissention among the leaders, and by doing so the
opportunity may present itself to have the informant put in a
high office.

The above is some of the potential counterintelligence
action contemplated by this office. It is being studied on a
day to day basis. The Bureau will be furnished with complete
details on all the above plans as the opportunities are made
and present themselves, prior to any specific action being
taken by this office.

ACTION GROUPS

Recent actions of violence in McComb, Mississippi,
were for the most part believed to be carried out by an \"action
group\". As a result of an intensive investigation and informant
coverage, 11 men were arrested. One had a membership card in
the Ku Klux Klan and another a card for membership in the
\"Americans for the Preservation of the White Race\". Some

Memorandum

TO : DIRECTOR, FBI DATE: 10/12/64

FROM: SAC, CHARLOTTE

SUBJECT: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM
INTERNAL SECURITY
DISRUPTION OF HATE GROUPS

ReBulet 9/2/64 to Atlanta and other offices.
It is noted this letter lists as one of the target organizations,
as No. 7 on page 2, the Independent Klavern, Fountain Inn, S. C.-
Since this organization is no longer active or in existence, it
is suggested it be deleted from this list.

Since the major organization in Charlotte Division
is the United Klans of America, Inc., of which Birmingham is
origin, a copy of this letter is being designated to Birmingham
for information.

The following represents the consensus of Charlotte
Agents familiar with Klan activity:

1. Disruptive activity should not be undertaken at
a particular Klavern, as a general rule, unless there is
sufficient well established informant coverage to be able to
tell the effect of the action when instituted. Such action
would probably serve to \"tighten up\" the organization and make
it more difficult to get an informant in thereafter,
;

2. It is considered doubtful that newspaper publicity,
of only a generally unfavorable nature against the Klan organi-
zation, is effective in reducing new applicants or causing any
large number of present members to drop out. The \"Charlotte
Observer,\" which has wide distribution throughout North and
South Carolina, published in August and September, 1964, a series
of articles, copies of which were sent the Bureau by Charlotte
letter of 9/15/64. These arifeles ridiculed the United Klans

NW 88608 Docid:32989629-Page-10-

of America, Inc., in North Carolina, and published both photos
and names of a number of members. So far as has been learned
from informants, this had very little adverse effect upon the
organization. It was alleged that two to five members were
discharged from their jobs, or warned about continuing member-
ship, but the identities of these alleged persons is not known.
North Carolina Grand Dragon JAMES R. JONES has stated, both
publicly and privately to informants, that this publicity was
very valuable to the growth of the organization. One informant
reported that the day after the articles published his name as
a local leader, three persons contacted him and applied for
membership, stating they had not previously known whom to contact.

It is considered that publicity of this type generally
deters from joining only those persons who would not be
interested in joining in the first place. It is believed that
a large proportion of those persons who are potential members
are seeking status and recognition, and publicity is no deterrent
to them; it makes them feel important and members of an important
group.

The major apparent effect of the series of newspaper
articles referred to has been a tightening up of security, and
refusal of leaders to allow newspaper photos of individual
Klansmen to be taken at public rallies.

3. Disruptive activity, wherever possible, should be of
a nature which does not expose the fact that the Bureau, or the
\"Federal Government\", is behind the activity. It is believed
that open action, to a large extent, can backfire and create
resentment and sympathy. It must be remembered that Klan
membership, in many sections, does not by any means carry the
odium that alleged Communist membership or sympathy does in
almost any section of society.

4. Along this same line, there is probably no point in
trying disruptive activity, at least not at this stage, on a
local Klan group which is small, inactive, and peaceful. Any
such activity which is not completely discreet and concealed
would likely have the effect of stirring it up.

5. By letter of 9/26/64, Charlotte furnished the Bureau
a sample of a lapel pin which was adopted at the Imperial

NW 88608 Docid:32989629 Page 11

Klonvocation of United Klans of America at Birmingham on
9/5-6/64. This is to be sold to members for $2 each and
there is apparently considerable demand for it. Since it is
not apparent to the unitiated that it has anything to do
with \"the Klan,\" it is expected that members will wear it.
openly as a secret recognition signal. If it does become
widely adopted and worn, consideration should then be given to
giving widespread publicity to the fact of what it represents.
This should have the result of discouraging some persons who
do not want their Klan membership publicly known.

6. It is considered that possibly the most effective
way of discouraging membership, or causing existing members
to withdraw, is to establish that someone in the organization
is getting rich off it, or embezzling the proceeds. Charlotte
is endeavoring to develop information along these lines, but
nothing specific has yet been developed.

7.
**
The following are suggested tactics that appear
useful on a selected basıs against individual Klansmen,
particularly those whose employers might object to their Klan
membership:

a. Anonymous letter or phone call to the employer
telling of the Klan membership.

b. Enter on behalf of the member a subscription to
the \"Fiery Cross,\" United Klans of America publication, and have
it mailed to his employment.

C. When a particular member is away from home at a
Klavern meeting, have a female phone his home and indicate he
was to meet her and is late. This might have the effect of
making it difficult for him to get away from home at night
thereafter. This should be limited to particular individuals
who are considered potential ones to stir up trouble in a Klavern.

8. ROBERT-ECHOLS SEOGGINS, Aka., Charlotte file-105-991
Bureau file-157-1530, is South-Carolina Grand-Dragon of United
Klans of America. Charlotte reports by SA JOHN-ALDEN MUNN,
1/31/64 and 3/27/64, show that he is receiving over $300 per
month from the Veterans Administration as a-100 percent
disabled veteran. At the same time he operates a plumbing
business and is active in United Klans of America, making
public speeches, etc. Charlotte furnished extra copies of
those reports to the Bureau, with the suggestion furnishing
them to VA be considered.

It is suggested consideration be given to asking the
VA to re-evaluate his disability rating, in view of his employment
and activities. It is believed this should be done on a SCG
level, to reduce the possibility of-SCOGGINS learning that such
a suggestion came from the FBI.

9. \"Action Groups.\" No particular such groups, given
to violence, are known within Klan organizations in Charlotte
territory. As the Bureau is aware, United Klans of America has
instituted what it calls \"Security Guards,\" who wear military
type uniforms and have military ranks. These function at
public rallies for the purpose of keeping order, watching for
\"spies,\" etc. It is expected that if violence is undertaken,
these will probably be the ones to do it, but no such under-
takings have been learned.

Specific individual recommendations for counter-
intelligence action will be submitted by subsequent letters as
developed.

ReBulet to Atlanta and Other Offices, 9/2/64.

Set out below are an analysis and recommendations
under captioned program.

NATIONAL STATES RIGHTS PARTY (NSRP)
:
The Arkansas branch of NSRP has been inactive
in the State of Arkansas for the past year with the excep-.
tion of placing on the Arkansas ballot candidates for
President and Vice President of the United States, It is
not recommended that any action be taken against this gro up
at this time.
:
ASSOCIATION OF ARKANSAS KLANS
OF THE KU KLUX KLAN
(AAK)

The AAK in Arkansas is made up of three klaverns
Iccated at Little Rock, Texarkana, and Pine Bluff; and
it has no affiliation with any national klan group. There
are no \"action\" groups within any of these three klaverns.
The three klaverns do not own or lease any property for
meeting places. The four Little Rock members usually
meet in the home of a member. The Texarkana Klavern has
not held any klavern meetings as such in several months.
The Pine Bluff Klavern meetings vary from residences to
business places of klavern members.

State meetings are held at irregular intervals
on an average of about once per month or less. There is
no regular meeting place for the state meetings, which are
held in various Arkansas towns including towns in which
there are no klaverns. The state meetings are attended

NW 88608 Docld:32989629 Page 14

V
by from one to five members of each of the three
klaverns and are well covered by informants. The State
Grand-Dragon-BILL-WILLIAMS has continually cautioned
members against violence and any type of illegal activities.
None of the klaverns have engaged in violence.

1. LITTLE ROCK KLAVERN

Of the four members who attend weekly meetings
JOR JY FARMER, who is considered the
head of this snail group, draws a pension from the Federal
Government and, according to informants, is afraid to
engage in any illegal activity or to let his name be used
in connection with the klan for fear of losing his pension.
The two informants maintain the full confidence of the
other two members. In recent months the klavern ran a
series of small ads in a Little Rock daily newspaper in
an effort to renew interest and gain new members. The
klavern received a number of responses, but no action
whatsoever has been taken by the klavern to take in any
new members. The klavern has no crganized activity other
than the weekly meetings described by informants as
being \"bull sessions\" with the principal topic being.
politics.

No recommendation for counterintelligence is
being made concerning the Little Rock Klavern.

2. TEXARKANA KLAVERN
:
This klavern has not held any klavern meetings
as such in several months, and it appears that the
principal reason for the lack of meetings was the inter-
view of members and leaders concerning the assassination
of President KENNEDY. Klavern representatives regularly.
attend state meetings, one reason being that State Grand
Dragon BILL WILLIANS, who officiates at state meetings,
is a member of the Texarkana Klavern. Of the five or
six members who from time to time attend state meetings,
two are informants. On 10/1/64
advised that the
Grand Dragon had stated that hereafter Texarkana Klavern
members will meet with the Bivins
Klavern of the AAK.

Grand Dragon. WILLIAMS, according to informants,
is active in politics in Bowie County, Texas, is a former
member of the Board of Regents of Texarkana Junior College,
Texarkana, Pewas, and in recent months as
for election to the Board of Regents of that college and
defeated as a candidate for the City Council of Texarkana,
Texas. He cannot afford to become involved in any illegal
activities because of his activities in legitimate enter-
prises. He has continually cautioned Texarkana Klavern
members as well as members of other klaverns attending
state meetings against any violence and/or illegal
activities.

No recommendation is being made for counterintel-
ligence against the Texarkana Klavern except as it is
effected by a recommendation set out hereafter under the
Pine Bluff Klavern.

3. PINE BLUFF KLAVERN

The Pine Bluff Klavern has a membership of approxi-
mately twenty to twenty-five. It meets once a week in
different business locations of its members, and average
weekly attendance is twelve. Among the twelve, one.or
two informants meet with them and furnish full coverage
of their activities.

The klavern's main activity has been to dis-
courage integration by legal means and to get members
elected to school board positions. The klavern collected
the funds and donated the money for the campaign expense
of two of its members who ran for a position on the Pine
Bluff School Board and the Dollarway School Board. These
two members made a miserable showing and were defeated.

The klavern was behind and organized the National
Patriots League (NPL) to further its non-integration
program publicly. The Exalted Cyclops, or president, of
the Klavern is chairman of the NPL. The NPL actually is
a front organization for the klavern. The main activity
of the NPL vas to organize a private country club, which
is known as the Butran Country Club. The purpose of the

NW 88608 Docld: 32989629-Page 16

club was to build a swimming pool for white only.
construction of the pool itself was complotce but not
sufficiently to place it in use this se
Kont
in Butram Country Club is $25. The majority of the
members are not aware of the fact that the klavern was
behind its organization. Membership in the Butram Country
Club was easily obtained as the public pool for whites
and public pool for Negroes were both closed during the
summer of 1964 when Negroes attempted to integrate the
white pool. This left no public pool open in Pine Bluff.
Re, vice president of the klavern, donated the
land for the Butram Country Club; as he owns land sur-
rounding the club, he will benefit financially from the
sale of this land for building lots. The NPL has also
distributed a limited number of leaflets publicly dis-
couraging peope from patronizing certain restaurants and
businesses which had hired or served Negroes,
: Members of the klavern were responsible for
forming a John Birch Society Chapter in Pine Bluff, and
a klavern member is leader of this chapter. Approximately
eight to ten people attend the monthly meetings of the
John Birch Society Chapter; and of the men who attend,
all are klavern members with the exception of one man.
Members of the klavern completely control and dominate
the John Birch Society Chapter in Pine Bluff. They,
however, only conduct John Birch Society business. Like-
wise, the members of the klavern further the John Birch
Society program through the klavern.

Members of the klavern are working individually
in politics for the re-election of Governor ORVAL-E.
FA-UBUS and for the election of BARRY-GOLDWATER:

The klavern has not advocated any violence but
on occasion has cautioned its members against violence.
As an example, klavern members were cautioned to stay.
away from Ray's Truck Stop, a location which Negroes were
attempting to integrate, in the spring of 1964 so that
no violence would occur.

Members of the klavern recently distributed a
Ku Klux Klan (KKK) leaflet seeking new members and
NW-88608-Docld:32989629-Page-17-
-4-

stating requests for applications be directed to P. O.
Box 1182, Pine Bluff. In this leaflet it was pointed
out that the KKK was striving for a lawful settlement
of the difficulties brought on by the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored People (NAAC) and
that it is opposed to violence. This leaflet further set
forth that this was a chartered, legalized movement and
it is no more illegal to be a member of it than to be a
member of other organizations.

At various times in the past the klavern has
attempted to organize \"action\" groups within the klavern,.
but on each occasion the project has died from lack of
interest.

In line with Bureau policy of dissemination of
information, the main activities regarding the Pine Bluff
Klavern have been disseminated confidentially to Chief
Lof Police NORMAN.D. YOUNG, Pine Bluff, (NA) on a regular
basis. Chief. YOUNG-has exerted every effort to keep down
the possibility of violence. Through his confidential
scurces he is also well aware of the identities of the
klavern members and their activities. He personally
has warned particur klavern members against any violence
and has stated they will be met with immediate arrest
if any violence occurs. As an example, Chief-YOUNG was
advised through his own confidential source of the time
and location of the klavern meeting on the night of
October 5, 1964. Chief YOUNG sent a lieutenant of his
department in uniform to check the location, record
license numbers, and to be seen checking the meeting so
that the klavern members would know that he was checking
on them. This has had a strong influence on making the
klavern follow a line of legal activity. It has also
resulted in the more responsible leading citizens of the
community being made aware of certain klavern members,
causing these klavern members to be discredited in the
eyes of the public. This was borne out in the recent
school board election on 9/29/64 when two klavern members,
one of whom is J. F. BUTRAM, were miserably defeated.

The klavern has during the past few months
urged its members to solicit and obtain new members.
The ineffectiveness of their program is shown by the

At this time the following are the only specific
counterintelligence action being recommended:
1

1. An anonymous letter be mailed to the National
Office of John Birch Society, Belmont, Massachusetts,
pointing out that the KKK is in full control of the John
Birch Society Chapter in Pine Bluff. In this letter
specifically mention the name of one or two of the more
leading klan members who are also leading the John Birch
Society in Pine Bluff.
:
The
2. An anonymous letter be mailed to CHARLES-D:-
CUTHBERTSON, Exartes-Cyclops of the Pine Bluff Klavern,
and a copy mailed to BILL WILLIAMS, State-Grand Dragon
with the letters to be mailed to the Post Office Box in
Pine. Bluff and in Texarkana, Arkansas, of the AAK.
letter should be a complaining letter from a member who
was active in the past and who recently found one of the
KKK leaflets in his automobile which leaflet encouraged
membership. The letter would let them know why he has
not rejoined; it would point out that he dropped out
because of such leadership as JBUTRAM, who has used
the klan for personal gain as BUFRAM had a residence on
his property remodeled at klavern expense and then made
the klavern stop holding meetings there; that BUTRAM
has now donated land for the Butram Country Club so that
he can sell his surrounding land for building lots at
an
exorbitant price. The letter should also set forth
the fact he heard SUTRAM was discharged from the Army
for mental deficiency (moron). This letter should be
mailed from Little Rock.

Interviews of klan members and leaders in the
past (for example, at the time of the assassination of
President KENNEDY and on particular bombing matter cases)
-6-

NW 88608 Docld:32989629 Page 19

have had deterring effect on the kian. For example,
the Texarkana Klavern has not held a klavern meeting
as such since that tire. One Little Rock member has
dropped out as a result of being intorviswod; and,
according to an informant, this member is a \"changed
nan,\" meaning that he is not as radical as previously.
In interviews with members of the Pine Bluff Klavern,
i agents have not met with any hostility and have been
treated cordially and with respect. Individual members
during these interviews have indicated they are opposed
to violence and advocate proceeding in a legal manner.
A number of the members have said that through political
pressure and voting are the only ways any change can
be made. However, they have stated they are still avid
segregationists and do not condone race mixing in any
manner。

When and if it appears that interest may be
renewing in the AAK in Arkansas, consideration will be
given to another interview program. It is noted, that
particular klan members are interviewed on a spasmodic
basis in regard to leads from surrounding field offices
on bombing matter cases, and this has had a tendency to
deter any violent activity on the part of klavern members.

NATIONAL STATES RIGHTS PARTY (NSRP)

The Arkansas branch of NSRP has been inactive :
in the State of Arkansas for the past year with the excep-
tion of placing on the Arkansas ballot candidates for
President and Vice President of the United States. It is
not recommended that any action be taken against this group
at this time.
:
ASSOCIATION OF ARKANSAS KLANS
OF THE KU KLUX KLAN
(ΑΑΚ)

The AAK in Arkansas is made up of three klaverns
located at Little Rock, Texarkana, and Pine Bluff; and
it has no affiliation with any national klan group. There
are no \"action\" groups within any of these three klaverns.
The three klaverns do not own or lease any property for
meeting places. The four Little Rock members usually
meet in the home of a member. The Texarkana Klavern has
not held any klavern meetings as such in several months.
The Pine Bluff Klavern meetings vary from residences to
business places of klavern members.

State meetings are held at irregular intervals
on an average of about once per month or less. There is
no regular neeting place for the state meetings, which are
held in various Arkansas towns including towns in which
there are no klaverns. The state meetings are attended

The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize investigative
efforts to authenticate Hoover memoranda dated 8/24-25/36.

Document Section, FBI Laboratory, determined the type appearing
on Hoover memorandum dated 8/25/36 was prepared on a Remington typewriter
with an elite type used since October, 1935. Hoover memorandum to Tamm dated
9/10/36, was prepared on an IBM typewriter with pica-style type used since 1930.

The letterhead used on both Hoover memoranda of 8/24-25/36 was
authorized FBI stationery effective August 14, 1936.

On 3/10/75, Mr. Donald B. Schewe, Assistant Librarian, Reference
Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, New York, advised that
The White House Ushers Appointment Book contained entries showing that
on Thursday, August 24, 1936, from 9:20 a.m. to 10:12 a.m., President
Roosevelt met with Mr. Hoover in his residence at The White House prior to
leaving for his office. Schewe pointed out that this meeting was significant
since President Roosevelt met Mr. Hoover immediately after returning from
an extended trip, a departure from his usual practice. There was no entry
on 8/25/36, other than the President's departure for the Dakotas at 10:40 p.m.

On 4/2/75, review of Cordell Hull Papers, Library of Congress,
reflected that a Desk Diary (container #68, folder #295, microfilm #38) of
Secretary Hull contained an entry on 8/25/36 that the Secretary had luncheon
with the President between 1:00p.m. to 3:15 p.m.

Detailed memorandum attached.

Dear Mike:

This will confirm our telephone conversation con-
cerning the procedure whereby we will make available to
you, or your designee, copies of draft reports relating
to the Justice Department. As we discussed, the pur-
pose is so that any classi classification (or other such
problems, e.g., the identity of informers) which may be
inadvertently raised in our reports can be identified.

The first two drafts relating to the FBI are ready.
They are:

1. \"The Use of Informers in FBI Domestic
Investigations\"; and

2. \"Domestic CIA and FBI Mail Opening Programs\".
(Substantial portions of which relate to the
FBI.)

I would appreciate it if someone very promptly could con-
tact Frederick D. Baron, my assistant (224-1746), who
will arrange the details of location and time for the
review.

Thank you very much-for-the-two-letters you sent
to Jim Adams about the remarks made by Senator Morgan.
I have seen him briefly since he made these remarks and
plan to see him next week again to talk over the reason for
these remarks at some length. As noted in his response to
you, apparently he has come to this feeling as a result of the
so-called \"unchallenged\" matters which he has had reported
to him as a member of the Senate Select Committee. It is
true that some mistakes of the Bureau were brought out, but
the over-all performance of the Bureau has, as you said, been
well above that which could even be expected of us and cer-
tainly has been most contributory to the safety of this nation
throughout the years. To categorize us as \"rotten to the core\"
and to indicate that we are a great threat to the United States
miss the mark tremendously and are completely without foun-
dation. I will so inform him, but apparently he has made up
his mind and there is little likelihood that we will have a
convert.

Again, thank you and I hope that you persist in yourgy
efforts to come to our support when our credibility has been

As you may recall, in a November 28, 1975,
memorandum from the Director, FBI, to the Assistant Attorney
General, Office of Legislative Affairs, captioned \"Watergate
Reorganization and Reform Act of 1975, S.495, 94th Congress,
1st Session,\" we deferred to the Department the question of
whether there should be a special prosecutor as envisioned
'by that bill.

On Friday, February 6, 1976, the Attorney
General of the United States testified before the Senate
Government Operations Committee. The Attorney General
stated he did not agree with Senator Church's proposal
that a special prosecutor should be appointed to investigate
past activities of the CIA and the FBI.

To advise that Senate Select Committee (SSC) Executive
Session was held on 2/13/76, where the role of the FBI in past
\"domestic intelligence investigations\" as well as the role that
the FBI should play in intelligence type investigations of
domestic subversive organizations in the future was discussed.
SSC requested copy of instructions sent to field by FBIHO
regarding Privacy Act matters which has a bearing on
investigations of domestic groups.

DETAILS:
Reference is made to Cregar to Mr. Wannall memorandu
dated 2/9/76, concerning SSC Executive Session held on 2/6/75,
at which time it was decided that an additional Executive Session
would be held at a future date, regarding \"domestic intelligence
investigations.\"

An SSC Executive Session was held from approximately
10:55 a.m., until 12:45 p.m., 2/13/76. Representing the SSC
were Chief Counsel Frederick A. O. Schwartz, Jr., who acted as
Chairman, John Elliff, Mark Gitenstein and Michael Epstein.
No
U.S. Senators were present. BuSTa104epresentatives offering
testimony were Assistant Director W. Raymond
Inspector-Deputy Assistant Director Hunter Helgason,
Section Chiefs Joseph G. Deegan and Robert L. Shackelord of
the Intelligence Division and Inspector John B. Hotis,
Legal Counsel Division.
Oct14395-1391
FEB 24 1976

At the outset of the Session, Mr. Schwartz explained
that this was a continuation of the Executive Session on 2/6/76
in an effort to assist the SSC in drafting legislation outlining
the Bureau's responsibility for domestic intelligence investiga-
tions which goes beyond criminal investigations. He noted
that at the closing of the past Executive Session,
Mr. Shackelford had stated the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA)

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75

and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) had been involved in
planning or organizing numerous large demonstrations in the
country and he desired to continue this discussion. A list of
major demonstrations with resulting damages and arrests which
occurred in the U.S. during the past ten years involving
subversive groups was furnished by Mr. Shackelford. A
discussion followed regarding the role of the FBI in gathering
intelligence information concerning the demonstrations as well
as the dissemination of the information which had been obtained.
Mr. Schwartz questioned the authority of the FBI in investigating
infiltrated groups such as the National Peace Action Coalition
(NPAC) and the Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ)
even though both groups were either dominated or influenced
by the CPUSA or the SWP.

A discussion then followed as to what effect the
enactment of the Privacy Act has on the investigation by the
FBI of domestic subversive groups. A request was made
concerning instructions which have been sent to the field by
FBIHQ concerning this matter.

The Session then turned to investigation of extremist
groups and the use of informants in these groups to obtain
advance information to prevent acts of violence. Specific
cases of this type were read into the record by Mr. Deegan.
Mr. Gitenstein questioned the authority of the Bureau to
place informants into these extremist groups without the
ingredient of violence present.

This Executive Session was adjourned at approximately
12:45 p.m. and no request was made at that time for another
Executive Session.

OBSERVATIONS:

From statements made by Mr. Schwartz and other SSC
staff members present, with the possible exception of Mr. Mark
Gitenstein, it appeared that these individuals continue to be
opposed to legislation authorizing Bureau investigations int he
domestic intelligence area unless the threat of violeme is
imminent. Mr. Gitenstein in his discussion concerning the use

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75

of informants in extremist groups appeared to want to
include in the record acts of violence which have been
prevented because of infiltration by informants in these
groups. It does appear, therefore, that he may be more
favorably inclined towards the Bureau's position in these
matters.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the SSC Unit, Intelligence Division, communicate
with a member of the SSC staff regarding Privacy Act material
and/or instructions desired by the Committee.

in fact separate from the United Klans of America (UKA) and
form the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (CKKKK). He
formed the CKKKK on his own initiative; however, we utilized
this opposing Klan organization through Dorsett as a means
of disrupting and causing confusion and dissension within the
Klan.

The Attorney General

The handling agent assisted Dorsett in
preparing a letter announcing his resignation from the UKA
and his formation of the CKKKK. This letter invited Dorsett's
friends in the Klan to join him in the CKKKK. A total of
41 chapters of the CKKKK were chartered; however, all of them
did not become effective operating chapters.

The documents delivered to the SSC were excised to
delete Dorsett's name as an informant. Charlotte airtel dated
August 22, 1967, and C. D. Brennan memorandum to W. C. Sullivan
dated August 24, 1967, set forth the recommendation and
approval for the mailing of a letter from Dorsett to all Klan
units in North Carolina announcing his resignation from the UKA
and the formation of the CKKKK. Dorsett's name is deleted from
these documents; however, it is clear that the informant was
preparing the letter. Charlotte airtel to the Director
September 13, 1967, refers to the August 22, 1967, Charlotte
airtel and states that the referenced airtel recommended Bureau
approval for a letter to be mailed over the signature of
Reverend George F. Dorsett under the above conditions.
name is not deleted from this document. From the above
documents Dorsett's identity can readily be established as the
FBI informant.

Dorsett's
In the December 6, 1975, issue of the \"Charlotte
Observer\" a daily Charlotte, North Carolina, morning
newspaper there is a front page article captioned \"FBI Started
41 North Carolina Klan Units, Morgan Says.\" In this article,
North Carolina Senator Robert Morgan, member of the SSC, said
the FBI organized 41 KKK units in North Carolina during the 1960's
as part of its campaign against the white supremacist group.
Morgan was also quoted as saying, \"The vast majority of
people in the Klan in North Carolina were law-abiding citizens.

The Attorney General

There may have been some violence, but we're not even sure
about that now.\" Morgan is further quoted as saying, \"There
is nothing basically wrong with having an informer in any
organization but when these informers do more than just listen,
when they instigate trouble, that's wrong.\" Morgan also said
the FBI financed the operations of the Federally organized
Klaverns.

As set forth in the enclosed memorandum, Mr. Dorsett
was interviewed on December 12, 1975, by Charlotte, North
Carolina, FBI Agents at which time he expressed his concern
for his personal safety and for his family as well, as well as
concern for the safety of his personal property.

As stated above this matter is considered to be a
most serious breach of the confidentiality that must be afforded
the material and information that this Bureau has furnished to
the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It is
respectfully requested that the enclosed memorandum be
delivered to Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the SSC,
personally. Please advise what action is taken concerning
this matter.

This is to call attention to the following incident

be afforded the material and information that this Bureau has
furnished to the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence:

The December 10, 1975, issue of the \"Greensboro Daily

article captioned \"Greensboro Man Named As FBI Klan Informant,\"
by Jack Betts, Daily News Washington Bureau. The article
states in part:

\"Washington - A Greensboro man long active in the
Ku Klux Klan has been identified as an informant for the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's campaign to disrupt the
KKK in North Carolina during the latter 1960's.

\"A Senate Intelligence Committee source said Tuesday
that George F. Dorsett, former Imperial Kludd (National Chaplain)
of the United Klans of America, was a paid FBI informant who,
with the FBI's assistance, broke away from the Klan in 1967 to
form a rival group.

Recommend entire document be classified \"Secret,\"
XGDS 1, 2, 3.

Portions recommended for excision from attached have
been underlined in red or bracketed in rea in left margin.

Generally, criteria for excision were:
1. Information which could identify sources or
sensitive techniques
2. Names of individuals or organizations whose
privacy requires protection
3. Information which would reveal our overall success
or lack of success in a given investigative area
4. Information from \"Third Agencies\" or friendly
foreign agencies
5. Identities of Bureau personnel below the Section
Chier level

The adequacy of Personnel Sections, in general,
disclose the extent of our commitment in specific areas of
counterintelligence activity. We have given the Committee
Administrative Division figures regarding total manpower
involved in security investigations but, to my knowledge, we
have not given them a breakdown as to here these personnel
are assigned. A policy decision is necessary as to whether we
Vant to pinpoint, through release of \"Adequacy of Personnel\"
sections of these inspection reports, precisely how much or
ho little manpower we have on specific types of investigations.

It is questionable whether the information regarding
criminal cases in the San Francisco report is germane to the
Committee's inquiry. It would not seem improper to me to
delete all references to criminal matters and merely substitute
a page saying that \"pages to
relate to criminal
investigations.\"

ELLSBERG CASE 4-A-3

SECTION CHIEF W. R. WANNALL whw
NATIONALITIES INTELLIGENCE SECTION
:
1. Initial investigation by Bureau opened 1/20/70 based on informa-
tion from step-mother of subject's former wife to the effect that subject, with
his children, took papers from his office at Rand Corporation in Santa Monica,
California, and copied them with intent that they be made available for Senators
Fulbright and Goodell. This information had come to knowledge of Carol
Ellsberg through the Ellsberg children. Initial investigation continued through
9/25/70 when basic facts were presented to Department of Justice with note that
no further action would be taken in the absence of a specific request from the
Department. No such request was received.

On 6/13/71 \"The New York Times\" commenced publishing a series
of articles purporting to report on the history of the U. S. decision-making process
concerning Vietnam policies for the period 1945-1967. \"The New York Times\"
claimed the articles were based on a study. later identified as a 47-volume history
entitled \"United States - Vietnam Relations During the Period 1945-1967, \"
commonly known as the \"McNamara Study.\" The \"McNamara Study\" was
prepared beginning in 1967 and was classified \"Top Secret.\"

On 6/15/71 the Attorney General requested FBI to conduct all necessary
investigation into the matter relating to the publication of classified information
by \"\"The New York Times.\" Our 1970 investigation and initial reports from
sources obtained in instant matter pinpointed Ellsberg as the prime suspect
responsible for the leak of classified data to news media. Extensive investigation
at Los Angeles pinned down the identities of individuals present in October,
1969, when Ellsberg duplicated classified documents available to him through his
employment at Rand Corporation in Santa Monica. Also revealed were his own
statements to his former wife that he, in fact, was converting the classified
documents to his own use to furnish them to various Congressional figures. The
Los Angeles investigation has resulted in Ellsberg's current indictment alleging
violation of Section 793(e), Title 18, U. S. Code (unauthorized possession of
documents involved and unlawful retention of same) and Section 641, Title 18
(conversion of the documents to his own use). The Los Angeles investigation was
the sole basis for this indictment and served as the basis for current imprisonment
on charge of contempt of court of Anthony J. Russo who was present on one
occasion when Ellsberg allegedly duplicated material in his possession.

Investigation at Washington, D. C., has pinned down Ellsberg's access
to the documents in question and has additionally revealed his early change from
\"hawk\" to \"dove.\" It has also revealed his contacts with individuals at high
levels in Federal Government attempting to persuade them to put before American
public details of decisions underlying the U. S. policy in Vietnam.

Investigation at Boston has uncovered activity by Neil and Susan
Sheehan, employees of \"The New York Times, \" in late March, 1971. This
activity has included extensive details of sessions where duplication of portions
of the \"McNamara Study\" were involved. Revealed have been details identifying
the printing companies utilized by the Sheehans, considerable travel between
these companies and apartments available to or utilized by Ellsberg. We have
uncovered extensive detail of Ellsberg's contacts from his Cambridge,
Massachusetts, residence with members of the news media. Also revealed has
been contact by Ellsberg with factions of the New Left and anti-Vietnam peace groups.

We have recently expanded our investigation in attempt to uncover details
of dissemination of the \"McNamara Study\" by Ellsberg to other newspapers in
which articles appeared attributed to the \"McNamara Study.\" This investigation
has revealed at least three newsmen from the Washington, D. C., bureaus of
the newspapers involved were in the Boston and/or Cambridge area during the week
immediately prior to Ellsberg's surrender on 6/28/71. We have learned that at
least one newspaper had been contacted by an unknown individual in Boston who had
offered the \"McNamara Study\" instructing that if the newspaper involved wished to
avail itself of the offer, the classified documents could be picked up in Boston
after contacting a given telephone number in that area for more detailed instructions.
We are pursuing this facet of the investigation vigorously to pin down exact activities
of the newspaper personnel involved and when this is done, we contemplate
interviewing them for additional details.

Extensive investigation has been afforded the possibility that Ellsberg
benefited from considerable assistance from other individuals in his attempt to
disseminate the \"McNamara Study\" to the news media. Along these lines we have
detected early reports of Ellsberg's cooperation with elements of the War Resistors
League and have identified individuals in that organization described by Ellsberg
as the principal influences on his change to a militant opposition to the U. S. -
Vietnam policies. Investigation is continuing along these lines to establish if any
individuals in these dissident groups may have assisted Ellsberg in his alleged
violations of the statutes noted.

A relative of Mr. Haldeman at the White House, France Raine, reported
that while attending a football game in Los Angeles in October, 1970, he overheard
a conversation between two men sitting near him whom he believed to be prominent
3
NW 88608 Docld:32989638 Page 15

-3
-
in the Business Executives Movement for Vietnam (BEM). This conversation
involved the plan on the part of an unidentified individual to leak secret informa-
tion to the press in the Spring of 1971, with the unidentified individual being
mentioned as being an employee of Rand Corporation and having formerly served
as an advisor to Dr. Kissinger at the White House. Also mentioned by the
conversants was the plan on the part of two White House aides to resign their
positions sometime during the Summer of 1971 and to make anti-Administration
revelations at that time regarding U. S. Vietnam policy. Ellsberg was known to
have appeared on at least two occasions as a speaker for BEM functions in
Los Angeles and Washington, D. C. A close associate of his in Los Angeles was
a former leader of the BEM chapter in that city. We have intensified our investiga-
tion of BEM and conducted extensive investigation to pin down identities of persons
seated near Raine during the game in question. We are continuing our investigation
along these lines to pinpoint a possible conspiracy existing as early as October,
1970, with ramifications of anti-Administration activity and revelation of classified
information.

We have recently received from Attorney General clarification of the
areas in which we can conduct investigation in this matter and, as a result, are
extending our interviews into news media circles where we feel we can uncover
individuals who will cooperate with us in revealing details of the Ellsberg
revelations and any conspiracy that may have existed involving him and others to
expose to public scrutiny the classified information involved in this case.

2. At the outset of this investigation Assistant Director Brennan spoke
at a Division Chiefs' Conference and also directly to the Section Chief, Nationalities
Intelligence Section, regarding the possibility of a wide-scale conspiracy in which
Ellsberg could be involved. His observations along these lines were recorded in
a memorandum to all Division Chiefs dated 7/23/71 and captioned \"Re: Organizations
Survey (Priorities and Manpower).\" In this memorandum he commented upon the
fact that the Ellsberg case might be a landmark in historical significance in view
of the long-range potential regarding Governmental operations and the FBI's role
in rel ation thereto. He stated that the leak in this case represented a deliberate
and determined effort on the part of certain individuals to seriously disrupt and
destroy the Government's capacity to carry out effectively its foreign policy in
various areas.

Mr. Brennan noted that the past 15 to 20 years had witnessed the evolution
of a new breed of fanatics who were determined to disrupt and destroy Governmental
operations and to alter this country's foreign policy. He further noted that the
movement supported by these fanatics bordered on treason which must be dealt
with if our current form of Government is to survive.

During the early stages of the investigation in this case it became
quite evident that Ellsberg had received assistance in getting into the hands
of various newspapers the \"McNamara Study.\" He admitted as much on
6/28/71 in responding to questions raised by reporters when he surrendered
himself at the Boston Courthouse following issuance of a complaint charging
him with violating the Espionage Statute. Accordingly, the thrust of our
investigation has been directed toward identifying any individual or individuals
or organization that may have assisted or conspired with Ellsberg. It was
noted that developments had indicated that at least part of the \"McNamara Study\"
was reportedly in the possession of the Institute for Policy Studies and that
while a page-by-page review of the Bureau's file on that Institute had not
revealed any information concerning Ellsberg, we had developed material in the
Ellsberg investigation showing connections between him and some of the Institute
employees.

On 7/6/71 the Director prepared a memorandum for Messrs. Tolson,
to
excising Sullivan, Brennan and Bishop to advise that the Honorable H. R. Haldeman,
Assistant to the President, had called the Director about the Ellsberg case.
The Director stated that Mr. Haldeman said the President wanted a report
on the case immediately to bring him up to date and then to keep him filled in,
and that the President was particularly interested in the complicity of individuals.
:
On 7/6/71 with the Director's approval a conference was held with
Departmental attorneys during which Assistant Attorney General Robert C.
Mardian explained that information coming to his attention from Departments
of Defense and State officials indicated that a group at each of these Departments
may be involved in a ring to pass out classified information. He said that while
this may or may not be related to the Ellsberg case he was most desirous of
getting a complete rundown on Ellsberg's background to determine if any of his
associates may have come under suspicion in connection with other leaks. He
also said the President was vitally concerned not only with the Ellsberg case but
with all aspects of leaks of classified information of the Executive Branch.

We have not developed any hard evidence confirming that a wide-spread
organized conspiracy exists to leak Government information. We are aware,
however, of one thread common to certain of these leaks. That is, individuals
such as Ellsberg, who were either bitterly opposed to the U. S. - Vietnam policy
or in disagreement with other major foreign policy issues, have set themselves
up above the law, claiming the right to decide what should be released to the
public regardless of Executive Branch classification assigned to information.
Many of these individuals in common with Ellsberg have been affiliated with one
or more of the so-called \"think tanks,\" such as Rand Corporation, have served
NW 88608 Docld:32989638 Page 17
کی

:,
in a number of sensitive positions in the Executive Branch of the Government
and to a large extent are acquainted with one another, at least on a professional
basis. Communications to appropriate field offices dated 7/7 and 12/71 contained
instructions regarding the necessity for exploring the various facets of this
situation.

The conspiracy aspects of the Ellsberg case as revealed to date are
set forth in Item 3 below.
...
3. Speculation that Daniel Ellsberg conspired with others in obtaining,
reproducing and disclosing the \"McNamara Study\" has some basis in public
remarks made by him on 6/28/71 indicating that \"It is implicit that other
individuals helped out in various ways, \" and that he and the press share the
responsibility for the newspapers' obtaining the study. We have, however,
pursued the possibility of conspiracy from every conceivable angle and while
investigation has produced some circumstantial evidence to support this theory,
we have not found grounds to indicate existence of an over-all plot or conspiracy,
threading its way throughout Ellsberg's actions.
:
Count One of a two-count indictment returned by a Federal grand jury
on 6/28/71 charges Ellsberg with unauthorized possession, access to, and
control over copies of what, in effect, was the \"McNamara Study,\" from about
September, 1969, to approximately October, 1969, while Count Two of this
indictment charges that during the same approximate time span Ellsberg
willfully, knowingly and unlawfully converted to his own use copies of these
documents. We have established Ellsberg legally had access to the Study in the
course of his employment with Rand Corporation at Santa Monica, California,
but that he also obtained and had in his possession 18 volumes of a preliminary
draft of the Study for at least nine months without the knowledge of the Top Secret
Control Officer at Rand in Santa Monica. Failure of Rand employees in Washington.
D. C., and at Santa Monica to adhere to established, in-house security procedures
accounts for the fact Ellsberg was able to conceal his possession of these 18
volumes, and while over-all possession by Ellsberg of the Study and its
preliminary draft volumes continues to be closely examined, no evidence exists
of conspiracy at this point of the case.........

Count Two of the aforementioned indictment, relating to conversion
of these documents, is founded on information that Ellsberg reproduced a large
quantity of classified documents in October, 1969, at the office of one Lynda Sinav.
in the Los Angeles area. Ellsberg's two children, present at this reproduction
session, have identified individuals who assisted Ellsberg in this task, but
:
NW 88608 Docld:32989638 Page 18

6
i
interviews of these persons have developed nothing to indicate they were aware
of the nature of the items being reproduced or of what use Ellsberg intended
to make of the copies reproduced. Anthony Russo, a fellow employee of
Ellsberg's at Rand in Santa Monica, would have been in an excellent position to
have been aware of the ultimate purpose of Ellsberg's actions but has refused to
talk to the Federal grand jury in Los Angeles, and is currently in jail for
contempt of court relating to this refusal.

Subsequent to the duplicating of documents in October, 1969, Ellsberg,
by his own statements, claims to have made efforts to furnish copies of these
documents to Senator J. William Fulbright and former Senator Charles E. Goodell,
: and Senator George S. McGovern may also have been approached by Ellsberg
concerning making these documents public. Representative Paul N. McCloskey,
Jr., is also known to be in possession of documents which he publicly admits
were given to him by Ellsberg. Data available concerning this phase of Ellsberg's
actions also fails to indicate he acted in concert with anyone.

On 6/13/71 \"The New York Times\" published the first of a series
of articles purporting to have been based on the \"McNamara Study, '\" and a
number of other newspapers in the U. S. subsequently printed similar articles.
Investigation has placed Neil Sheehan, a reporter for \"The New York Times,\" in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, during March and April, 1971, under an assumed
name, and we have determined Sheehan and his wife engaged in a number of
frantic copying sessions of documents during the period 3/21-23/71. Four
blurred Xerox copies discarded during this duplicating have been identified by
the National Security Agency as being reproductions of pages appearing in the
\"McNamara Study.\" It is highly probable Sheehan and Ellsberg cooperated closely
in actions which enabled \"The New York Times\" to obtain the documents utilized
in articles published by this newspaper and we have recently uncovered evidence
indicating representatives of at least three other newspapers which have published
articles based on the \"McNamara Study\" were in the Boston area in June, 1971,
for the apparent purpose of obtaining copies of these documents. A source closely
connected with one of these newspapers has advised that his newspaper obtained
the documents after receiving a telephone call from an unknown individual who
instructed that a reporter from the newspaper go to Cambridge and make the
necessary arrangements to obtain them by calling a certain, unidentified telephone
number. Investigation subsequently placed this reporter in Cambridge, but we
have, to date, been unsuccessful in determining who furnished him with the
material in question. While the newspapermen thus involved may have cooperated
with Ellsberg in various ways in order to obtain the desired documents,
available evidence does not suggest they conspired with him in carrying out the
disclosure of these documents, but rather took advantage of his offer to furnish
them with the material.
NW 88608 Docld:32989638 Page 19

eake
We are, however, vigorously pursuing all leads relating to the
possession by \"The New York Times\" and other newspapers of the \"McNamara
Study\" and have proposed that the field be authorized to immediately initiate
interviews with friendly newsmen concerning this matter. We believe this area
of investigation offers excellent possibilities of effecting a major breakthrough
in this case.
:
There remains the suggestion Ellsberg may have received the coopera-
tion of or conspired with various New Left, anti-draft, anti-Vietnam war
elements, and this possibility has received the most penetrating examination.
We know Ellsberg to have been friendly with a number of individuals connected
with the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) in Washington, D. C., and evidence
exists that the IPS has been in possession for some time of documents which may
be identical with the \"McNamara Study.\" We have also learned, in tracing the
development of Ellsberg's thinking from \"hawk\" to \"dove,\" that from August,
1969, he became increasingly associated with a number of the more prominent
anti-war exponents in this country, many of whom occupy important posts at
Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We are in the
process of tying together all of this data, in an effort to surface, if possible,
any possible connection between these elements and Ellsberg in the disclosure
of the highly classified \"McNamara Study,\" but information available to date
does not, as yet, substantiate or corroborate existence of a conspiracy in this
regard.

4. With particular regard to the President's concern expressed by
in. Mr. Haldeman to the Director, mentioned hereinbefore, with respect to the
:
:
complicity of individuals, and the instructions of the Attorney General that the
Bureau in each leak case identify the individuals responsible, it is quite clear
that we must resolve all allegations, especially those pertaining to possible
conspiracies, during the course of our inquiries. As noted in Item 1, our
inquiries have expanded to include not only the leak to \"The New York Times\"
but to encompass the eight other newspapers which carried portions of the
\"McNamara Study.\". Since its inception, the Ellsberg case has required expanding
supervisory attention here at the SOG.. Nine men are currently committed to the
case. There are no indications at this time that less supervisory attention will be
needed in the near future. In fact, all indications are that there may have to be
more commitments in this regard, particularly if the Department refers additional
leak matters to us for the intensive investigative attention which has been
requested in the past.

A successful investigation followed by a successful prosecution would
certainly have a very important impact on Governmental processes, particularly
:
NW 88608 Docld:32989638 Page 20

8
within the Executive Branch of our Government. When the Supreme Court
refused to grant injunctions sought by the Executive Branch against newspapers
publishing the \"McNamara Study, \" this upheld the freedom of the press. The
question has not yet been litigated with respect to the right of the Executive
Branch to protect its secrets through its classification system.

Unless Ellsberg is prosecuted successfully, anyone within the
Executive Branch would apparently have the right to decide on his own initiative
what information he wishes to place in the public domain by turning the informa-
tion over to the newspapers. Much of the sensitive negotiations of the Executive
Branch with foreign countries is dependent upon the secrecy with which they
are carried out. If through a classification system or some other means the
Executive Branch is not able to preclude the unauthorized disclosure of its
secrets it is felt the Branch will be weakened to the extent that it cannot effectively
function on the national scene certainly, and probably on the domestic scene in
some instances. Thus, the structure of the Executive Branch might well collapse.

inter
An unsuccessful prosecution would buttress the considerable support,
particularly from the news media, for Ellsberg's contention that his disclosure
of the classified documents was basically motivated by conscience and by deep
concern that the public should be informed. It is closely related to the viewpoint
held by a small but growing minority that an individual is free to follow the dictates
of his conscience and to be the final arbiter of the validity of our criminal and
civil statutes. If this thesis were to be supported, then it could apply to murder
and bombings of Government and private institutions where such acts are dictated
by conscience. It could follow that the Legislative, Executive and Judicial
functions of the Nation are exercises in futility. This would be a road to anarchy.

From the above, it would appear that the outcome of the Ellsberg
case would have a direct bearing on the Executive Branch of our Government and
could affect the entire Governmental structure.
:
5(a). At the outset of the investigation, Assistant Director Brennan
instructed the Section Chief to afford special attention to this case and to let
him know of any manpower needs. He emphasized the importance of the case in
his mind and wanted it handled as a special.

Within a day or two Mr. Brennan introduced the Section Chief to
Departmental attorney James McGrath, who is a special assistant to Assistant
Attorney General Mardian. Mr. Brennan advised the Section Chief that McGrath
was the coordinator for Mardian of the various groups under Mardian engaged
in consideration of phases of the Ellsberg case. For example, he explained that
NW 88608 Docld:32989638 Page 21

9
;
one group headed by Departmental attorney John Martin, analyzed all investigative
results received by the Department in an effort to establish whether a case was
being made. Mr. Brennan advised the Section Chief that Mr. McGrath would be
in a position to furnish any information required by the Section Chief from the
Internal Security Division and instructed that copies of daily teletypes received
from our various offices be furnished through Mr. McGrath to the Internal Security
Division as they came in.
..5(b). Approximately two weeks after this case was instituted, the
Section Chief asked Mr. Brennan if he would brief both the Section Chief and the
Section Number One Man on his concept of the magnitude of this case and its
various ramifications. This was done and Mr. Brennan again emphasized the
need for following all facets on a special basis.

Following the conference with Departmental attorneys 7/6/71,
mentioned hereinbefore, Mr. Brennan summoned Inspector D. E. Moore and
Section Chief Wannall to his office and instructed that a \"book\" be prepared on
Ellsberg covering his activities and associates during a period of a couple of
years. He explained what he wanted in this book and provided for an Agent from
Research Section to be assigned full time on its compilation.

On 7/15/71 Mr. Brennan instructed that a copy of each teletype received
at the SOG on this case be furnished to him.
: On 7/28/71 Mr. Brennan summoned Inspector D. E. Moore, Section
Chief, Section Number One Man, and all Agents working on this case to his
office for a conference. In compliance with his request, he was briefed on
investigative results to date. He asked if serious consideration had been given
to the possibility that Ellsberg himself was not directly involved in turning over
the \"McNamara Study\" to \"The New York Times, \" and instructed that we look
into this phase of the matter very carefully.

On 8/2/71 Mr. Brennan summoned to his office the Section Chief and
Case Supervisor Wagoner for the purpose of introducing them to Mr. G. G
Liddey of the White House. He explained that Mr. Liddey was coordinating all
White House interest in this matter. Mr. Liddey pointed out that the White
House wanted this case handled as a \"Bureau special\" and that a letter from the
White House to that effect would be forwarded.

:
5(c). At the present time there are nine Agent Supervisors assigned
to this matter.

Investigation was instituted 6/15/71 and from then until 6/23/71
manpower assignments were handled within the Section.
2
On 6/23/71 two additional Agents were placed in the Section on a loan
basis and they were assigned to operational desks, as Agents permanently assigned
to those desks from within the Section were assigned to the McLek case.
:
On 6/28/71 an Agent was assigned on a loan basis from Extremist
Intelligence Section and this loan Agent has been rotated on a weekly basis
since. He has been utilized to cover an operational desk while one of the
regularly assigned Agents in the Section (H. J. Morgan) has been assigned
full time to this case.

On 7/8/71 an Agent from Research Section was assigned full time to
prepare a \"book\" on Ellsberg and has worked on this exclusively with the
exception of an ammual leave period of 8/2-13/71. IHe has not participated in any
other phase of the case on a day-to-day basis.

On 7/8/71 one man on weekly rotating basis was assigned temporarily
from the Espionage Section and continues to the present time. This loan Super-
visor has been utilized to cover an operational desk within the Section while the
regularly assigned Supervisor on the desk (J. R. Hagy) has been utilized full time
on instant case.

On 7/29/71 an Agent from within the Section (L. E. Belanger) was
assigned part time to handle special aspects of the Ellsberg case,

The following represents the writer's recollection
of testimony given this date before the Senate Select Committee
(SSC) pursuant to subpoena. The session commenced at 10 a.m.
former
5/21/75 in Room 607, Caroll Arms Hotel. Present was Senator
Robert Morgan (North Carolina); Lester B. Seidel, Staff Member;
Mr. Jack Smith, Staff Member; Mr. John Bailey, Assistant
Minority Counsel, and a male reporter. Senator Morgan placed
the writer under oath. Approximately four or five minutes later
Senator Morgan excused himself with a general statement to
the effect he had other pressing matters. The entire proceedings
with only two exceptions were conducted by Lester B. Seidel.

Seidel explained the writer was entitled to counsel,
had the privilege of invoking provisions of the Fifth Amendment,
and would have the privilege of making an opening and closing
statement. Seidel inquired whether the writer understood his
Crights and the Committee's rules and regulations, a copy of
which he had made available.

The writer acknowledged receipt of the Committee's
rules and regulations as furnished by Seidel at 9:31 a.m.
5/21/75. He also acknowledged he had been informed of the right
to courriForuminasmuch as this Committee was not understood

to constitute a grand jury and in the absence of any charges
or allegations of a violation of law on his part, he did not
insist on the presence of counsel.
Seidel was advised that
advised as a former Special Agent the
writer had contacted the Bureau's Legal Counsel Division and
as of this date had been advised by Mr. Paul Daly thereof that
he had been cleared by the Attorney General (AG) to testify
to matters relating to investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley
Levison.

\"Seidel was advised that during his interview of the
writer in Atlanta, Georgia, on 5/12/75 he had asked a question
as to how long after the assassination of King did the telephone
surveillance continue on the King residence. On 5/12/75 the
writer responded it was his recollection this coverage continued
until a short time subsequent to the assassination. Following
that interview, the writer recalled that either shortly before
or shortly after that case was assigned to the writer, the King
family had moved from one residence to another and that
continuation of the telephone surveillance from the former
residence to the latter one was not authorized. Secondly,
Seidel on 5/12/75 had asked when the King and SCLC cases were

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 3

assigned to the writer, the writer recalled such assignment
was in the early part of 1965; that it was now the writer's
recollection this assignment was made in May, 1965.

Set forth below are questions asked by Seidel (unless
otherwise indicated) and the writer's answers. These questions
and answers are not set forth chronologically.

Q. Why was continuance of the telephone surveillance
not continued to the Kings' new residence?
A. Continuance was not authorized by the AG.

\"Q. What telephone surveillance was there conducted by
Atlanta of Stanley Levison?
A. There was no such coverage per se only such as afforded
by contacts made of King or members of the SCLC staff by
Levison.

Q. Was there telephone surveillance of Levison in New York?
\"A. Any contacts of King by Levison while in New York would
have been covered.

Q. Did the New York Office maintain telephone surveillance
of Levison?
A. I do not directly know.

Q. During the Atlanta interview you indicated you had read
New York reports concerning Levison. Is that correct?

A. Yes.
↑ Q. During Atlanta interview you indicated you presumed
these reports set forth information concerning Levison from
a telephone surveillance. Is that correct?
A. Yes.

Q. What was the basis for your presumption?
A. The appropriate administrative portion of such report
would have so indicated.

Q. What evidence of CP connections did your investigation
develop concerning Levison?
\"A. None.

Q. What information did you have establishing CP connection
re Levison?
A. Such information as was set forth in what was then referred
to as a characterization of Levison. Such characterization was
a part of each report submitted to the Bureau.

Q. What was the nature of this characterization?
A. I do not remember the precise language. It is my recollection
the statement was brief and set forth information establishing
past and/or present CP affiliation by Levison.

Q. Where did you obtain this characterization?
Α. A. A characterization of an individual or organization at
that time was prepared by the field office concerned, submitted

to Bureau Headquarters for its approval, and such was made
available to offices having a need-to-know this information.

Q. What was the source of this information regarding Levison.
A. I do not recall that I was ever, apprised thereof. A
characterization would not indicate the source of the information,
unless public source information was utilized, otherwise the
reliability or lack thereof of the source or sources would be
indicated but not their identity.

\"Q. What prompted you today to amend your answer on May the 12th
75 as to how long telephone surveillance continued on the King
A
residence? Did you seek the advice or an answer from someone?
ONLY
\"A. To the extent that subsequent to May the 12th I conferred
with a former Agent, Charles Harding, prior te
P
thereto
prior to that time-which-it
to that question
had concerned me, that my initial answer for some reason did not
impress me as being completely correct. I mentioned this to
Harding and he informed me that my answer was incorrect and
mentioned the change in the King residence and the fact coverage
had not been thereafter authorized. When he informed me of
this I immediately récalled the change in residence which
previously had escaped my memory.

Q. Why would Harding know this information?

NW 886.14 Docld:32989606 Page 6
:

A. For a period of time he was in a supervisory capacity.
Q. Was he in a supervisory capacity when the change in
residence was made?
\"A. He was in a relief supervisory capacity at that time.

Q. Why did you rely on Harding's recollection? Is his recollection
better than yours?
A. I am not suggesting his recollection is better or worse
than mine. What he said to me merely served to jog my memory
upon which I based my earlier statement today.

Q. You recall when I interviewed you in Atlanta most of
?
my questions were taken from prepared notes.
A. Yes.

\"Q. You recall that I told you that I would make notes during
the interview in order that I might later refresh my recollection
?
as to your testimony.
A. Yes, and Mr. Seidel, you recall that I did not take any
notes (to which he answered in the affirmative).

Q. Did you make any recording of that interview at the time?
A. I did not.

Q. Did you make any subsequent written recording of the
interview?

I realize that you have the perogative of subpoenaing it.
In the absence thereof, I prefer not to make it available.

do not remember.

Q. Who handled SCLC and Levison case after you left the Bureau?
A. Richard Hamilton.

Q. What was the fist of such communications?
\"A. Advisement that such installation had been authorized,
instructions to initiate the coverage.

Q. Who installed the surveillances, Al Miller; was he not a
technician, a wireman?

by an Agent who was not from the Atlanta Office. I do not
remember his name.

Q. Did you monitor any of these surveillances?
\"A. No.

Q. Can you give an example of such reference?
A. There is only one particular conversation that comes to
mind at the moment and I have no recollection with whom the
conversation was held during which reference was made to a
wonderful sermon they had preached together on somebody's
kitchen floor.

Q. Kitchen floor?
A. Yes.

Q. What surreptitious entry was made in respect to the King
residence or SCLC headquarters?

was none..

Q. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location
to use against King or SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious
entry to obtain it?
A. No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say
this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late
1950s concerning such a technique had changed.

Q. (By.Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy
had changed?

King was a CP member. It did establish that he was in contact

any Bureau official..

indicating this program began during the late 1950s and
continued to a fairly recent date. Did not your reports
regarding King, SCLC, or Levison include in their caption
COINTELPRO?
A. It is not my recollection that they did.

'Q. What about a Klan organization?
A. I did at various times handle investigations concerning
individual Klan members. I'did not handle the Klan as an
organizational matter. It is my recollection that in reporting

of the case would have been indicated as Ku Klux Klan Racial
Matter.

I feel compelled to apologize if I appear particularly
dense as to the utilization of this phrase COINTELPRO. If it
was a program operating over a period of years the only explanati on
I can offer at this moment is that conceiably some field offices
imtially
other than Atlanta were involved therein. If this was the
case, Atlanta may well have been included therein subsequent
to my departure.

Q. (John Bailey) When the telephone surveillance was discontinued
on the King residence and on SCLC who took care of that.
A. I do not know.

It should be noted the Committee took a five minute
break approximately 12:05 to 12:10 p.m. ofter which questioning.

Following a few very general concluding comments
by Seidel, the writer was given the opportunity to make a
statement. At this point Seidel was advised it was the writer's
understanding that the procedures of this Committee provided for
a witness to subsequently have opportunity to review the transcript
thereof, and that the writer would like to avail himself of
this opportunity. Inquiry was made as to whether this could be
accomplished via registered or certified mail to preclude unnecessary
expense to the Government.

Seidel responded at some length referring to (Section

Is that correct?

Q. What was the basis for your presumption?
A. The appropriate administrative portion of such report
would have so indicated.

Q. What evidence of CP connections did your investigation
develop concerning Levison?
\"A. None.

Q. What information did you have establishing CP connection
re Levison?
A. Such information as was set forth in what was then referred
to as a characterization of Levison. Such characterization was
a part of each report submitted to the Bureau.

Q. What was the nature of this characterization?
A.
I do not remember the precise language. It is my recollection
the statement was brief and set forth information establishing
past and/or present CP affiliation by Levison.

that time was prepared by the field office concerned, submitted

to Bureau Headquarters for its approval, and such was made
available to offices having a need-to-know this information.

Q. What was the source of this information regarding Levison.
A.
I do not recall that I was ever, apprised thereof. A
characterization would not indicate the source of the information,
unless public source information was utilized, otherwise the
reliability or lack thereof of the source or sources would be
indicated but not their identity.

\"Q. What prompted you today to amend your answer on May the 12th
75 as to how long telephone surveillance continued on the King

with a former Agent, Charles Harding, prior te
P
thereto
prior to that time-which-it
to that question
had concerned me, that my initial answer for some reason did not
impress me as being completely correct. I mentioned this to
Harding and he informed me that my answer was incorrect and
mentioned the change in the King residence and the fact coverage
had not been thereafter authorized. When he informed me of
this I immediately récalled the change in residence which
previously had escaped my memory.

Q. Why would Harding know this information?

A. For a period of time he was in a supervisory capacity.

Q. Was he in a supervisory capacity when the change in
residence was made?
\"A. He was in a relief supervisory capacity at that time.

Q. Why did you rely on Harding's recollection?
better than yours?
Is his recollection

A.
I am not suggesting his recollection is better or worse

than mine. What he said to me merely served to jog my memory
upon which I based my earlier statement today.

Q. You recall when I interviewed you in Atlanta most of

my questions were taken from prepared notes.
A. Yes.

\"Q. You recall that I told you that I would make notes during
the interview in order that I might later refresh my recollection

as to your testimony.
A. Yes, and Mr. Seidel, you recall that I did not take any
notes (to which he answered in the affirmative).

Q. Did you make any recording of that interview at the time?
A. I did not.

Q. Did you make any subsequent written recording of the
interview?

I consider it a personal item for my personal use.
I realize that you have the perogative of subpoenaing it.
In the absence thereof, I prefer not to make it available.

\"Q. How long after King's assassination did the telephone
surveillance of SCLC continue?
A. I cannot be certain. It continued for a period of time
which may have been one, two, possibly three months. I simply
do not remember.

Q. Who handled SCLC and Levison case after you left the Bureau?
A. Richard Hamilton.

Q. When did he assume these cases?
\"A. I cannot recall precisely. I am not even sure whether they
had been administratively reassigned to him prior to my departure.

Q. Who else besides Stanley Levison was in contact with King
who you understood to have some type of CP connections?
A. There was Hunter Pitts O'Dell, Bayard Rustin, and Harry
Wachtel.

Q. What was the fist of such communications?
\"A. Advisement that such installation had been authorized,
instructions to initiate the coverage.

Q. Who installed the surveillances, Al Miller; was he not a
technician, a wireman?

Alden Miller was an Atlanta Agent who had certain technical
ability. It is my recollection the surveillance was installed
by an Agent who was not from the Atlanta Office. I do not
remember his name.

Q. Did you monitor any of these surveillances?
\"A. No.

Q. Did you monitor any such surveillance during this period
of time?

conversation was held during which reference was made to a
wonderful sermon they had preached together on somebody's
kitchen floor.

Q. Kitchen floor?
A. Yes.

Q. What surreptitious entry was made in respect to the King
residence or SCLC headquarters?
A. During the period I was concerned with these cases there
was none..

Q. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location
to use against King or SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious
entry to obtain it?
A. No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say
this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late
1950s concerning such a technique had changed.

Q. (By.Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy
had changed?

was a communist, was not this investigation in vain?

King was a CP member.
It did establish that he was in contact

I did not discuss that matter with Mr. Hoover or
any Bureau official..

need-to-know basis and I have absolutely no recollection that
members of the Atlanta Police Department fitted into this category.

Q. Where is he now?
A.
I understand he retired, I do not know where he is located.

indicating this program began during the late 1950s and
continued to a fairly recent date. Did not your reports
regarding King, SCLC, or Levison include in their caption
COINTELPRO?
A.
It is not my recollection that they did.

'Q. What about a Klan organization?
A.
I did at various times handle investigations concerning
individual Klan members. I'did not handle the Klan as an
organizational matter. It is my recollection that in reporting
on the activities of an individual Klan member the character
of the case would have been indicated as Ku Klux Klan Racial
Matter.

I feel compelled to apologize if I appear particularly

I can offer at this moment is that conceiably some field offices
imtially
other than Atlanta were involved therein. If this was the
case, Atlanta may well have been included therein subsequent
to my departure.

Q. (John Bailey) When the telephone surveillance was discontinued
on the King residence and on SCLC who took care of that.

It should be noted the Committee took a five minute
break approximately 12:05 to 12:10 p.m. ofter which questioning.

Following a few very general concluding comments
by Seidel, the writer was given the opportunity to make a
statement. At this point Seidel was advised it was the writer's
understanding that the procedures of this Committee provided for
a witness to subsequently have opportunity to review the transcript
thereof, and that the writer would like to avail himself of

accomplished via registered or certified mail to preclude unnecessary
expense to the Government.

with only two exceptions were conducted by Lester B. Seidel.

Seidel explained the writer was entitled to counsel,
had the privilege of invoking provisions of the Fifth Amendment,
and would have the privilege of making an opening and closing
statement. Seidel inquired whether the writer understood his
rights and the Committee's rules and regulations, a copy of
which he had made available.

The writer acknowledged receipt of the Committee's
rules and regulations as furnished by Seidel at 9:31 a.m.
5/21/75. He also acknowledged he had been informed of the right
to counsel but inasmuch as this Committee was not understood

to constitute a grand jury and in the absence of any charges
or allegations of a violation of law on his part, he did not
insist on the presence of counsel.
Seidel was advised as a former Special Agent the
writer had contacted the Bureau's Legal Counsel Division and
as of this date had been advised by Mr. Paul Daly thereof that
he had been cleared by the Attorney General (AG) to testify
to matters relating to investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley
Levison.

\"Seidel was advised that during his interview of the
writer in Atlanta, Georgia, on 5/12/75 he had asked a question
as to how long after the assassination of King did the telephone
surveillance continue on the King residence. On 5/12/75 the
writer responded it was his recollection this coverage continued
until a short time subsequent to the assassination. Following
that interview, the writer recalled that either shortly before
or shortly after that case was assigned to the writer, the King
family had moved from one residence to another and that
continuation of the telephone surveillance from the former
residence to the latter one was not authorized. Secondly,
Seidel on 5/12/75 had asked when the King and SCLC cases were

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 3

assigned to the writer, the writer recalled such assignment
was in the early part of 1965; that it was now the writer's
recollection this assignment was made in May, 1965.

Set forth below are questions asked by Seidel (unless
otherwise indicated) and the writer's answers. These questions
and answers are not set forth chronologically.

Q. Why was continuance of the telephone surveillance
not continued to the Kings' new residence?

A. Continuance was not authorized by the AG.

\"Q. What telephone surveillance was there conducted by
Atlanta of Stanley Levison?

A. There was no such coverage per se only such as afforded
by contacts made of King or members of the SCLC staff by
Levison.

Q. Was there telephone surveillance of Levison in New York?

\"A. Any contacts of King by Levison while in New York would
have been covered.

Q. Did the New York Office maintain telephone surveillance
of Levison?

A. I do not directly know.

Q. During the Atlanta interview you indicated you had read
New York reports concerning Levison. Is that correct?

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 4
3

\"A. Yes.

↑ Q. During Atlanta interview you indicated you presumed
these reports set forth information concerning Levison from
a telephone surveillance. Is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. What was the basis for your presumption?

A. The appropriate administrative portion of such report
would have so indicated.

Q. What evidence of CP connections did your investigation
develop concerning Levison?

\"A. None.

Q. What information did you have establishing CP connection
re Levison?

A. Such information as was set forth in what was then referred
to as a characterization of Levison. Such characterization was
a part of each report submitted to the Bureau.

Q. What was the nature of this characterization?

A. I do not remember the precise language. It is my recollection
the statement was brief and set forth information establishing
past and/or present CP affiliation by Levison.

Q. Where did you obtain this characterization?

Α. A characterization of an individual or organization at
that time was prepared by the field office concerned, submitted

NW-88614 Docld:32989606 Page 5
4

to Bureau Headquarters for its approval, and such was made
available to offices having a need-to-know this information.

Q. What was the source of this information regarding Levison.

A. I do not recall that I was ever, apprised thereof. A
characterization would not indicate the source of the information,
unless public source information was utilized, otherwise the
reliability or lack thereof of the source or sources would be
indicated but not their identity.

\"Q. What prompted you today to amend your answer on May the 12th
75 as to how long telephone surveillance continued on the King
residence? Did you seek the advice or an answer from someone?

\"A. To the extent that subsequent to May the 12th I conferred
with a former Agent, Charles Harding, prior to that time-which-it
had concerned me, that my initial answer for some reason did not
impress me as being completely correct. I mentioned this to
Harding and he informed me that my answer was incorrect and
mentioned the change in the King residence and the fact coverage
had not been thereafter authorized. When he informed me of
this I immediately récalled the change in residence which
previously had escaped my memory.

Q. Why would Harding know this information?

NW 886.14 Docld:32989606 Page 6
:

A. For a period of time he was in a supervisory capacity.

Q. Was he in a supervisory capacity when the change in
residence was made?

\"A. He was in a relief supervisory capacity at that time.

Q. Why did you rely on Harding's recollection? Is his recollection
better than yours?

A. I am not suggesting his recollection is better or worse
than mine. What he said to me merely served to jog my memory
upon which I based my earlier statement today.

Q. You recall when I interviewed you in Atlanta most of
my questions were taken from prepared notes?

A. Yes.

\"Q. You recall that I told you that I would make notes during
the interview in order that I might later refresh my recollection
as to your testimony.

A. Yes, and Mr. Seidel, you recall that I did not take any
notes (to which he answered in the affirmative).

Q. Did you make any recording of that interview at the time?

A. I did not.

Q. Did you make any subsequent written recording of the
interview?

...NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 7

\"A. Yes, I did so for my personal information.

1
Q. Is such writing available to this Committee?

A. I consider it a personal item for my personal use.
I realize that you have the perogative of subpoenaing it.
In the absence thereof, I prefer not to make it available.

\"Q. How long after King's assassination did the telephone
surveillance of SCLC continue?

A. I cannot be certain. It continued for a period of time
which may have been one, two, possibly three months. I simply
do not remember.

Q. Who handled SCLC and Levison case after you left the Bureau?

A. Richard Hamilton.

Q. When did he assume these cases?

\"A. I cannot recall precisely. I am not even sure whether they
had been administratively reassigned to him prior to my departure.

Q. Who else besides Stanley Levison was in contact with King
who you understood to have some type of CP connections?

A. There was Hunter Pitts O'Dell, Bayard Rustin, and Harry
Wachtel.

Q. Hunter Pitts O'Dell, the same as Jack O'Dell?

A. Yes, he was.

Q. What evidence of CP connections or domination by Moscow of
O'Dell, Rustin, Wachtel, did your investigation develop?

NW-88614 Docld:32989606 Page 8
7

A. It did not develop any such information.

Q. How did you know of whatever their CP affiliation may
have been?

A. In the same manner as in regard to Levison.

\"Q. What investigation did Atlanta conduct of O'Dell, Rustin,
and Wachtel?

\"A. There was no active ongoing investigation conducted of
these individuals other than during such periods when they were
in contact with King or members of SCLCX

\"Q. Was Coretta King ever the target of an electronic surveillance?

A. Not to my knowledge beyond such coverage as might have occurred.
from the telephone surveillance when it applied to the King
residence or on such occasions when she might have been present
in SCLC headquarters.

Q. Do you know when the telephone surveillance of King and
SCLC were initiated?

A. I did not have the cases at that time.

Q. Did you not learn of such information while you had these
cases?

A. Yes.

Q. How?

A. From information in the appropriate file.

Q. What communication transpired between the Bureau and
Atlanta relative to the initiation of these telephone surveillances,

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 9

airtels, letters, memoranda?

A. I am certain there were airtels, letters, possibly
teletypes in the file..

Q. What was the gist of such communications?

\"A. Advisement that such installation had been authorized,
instructions to initiate the coverage.

1
Q. Who installed the surveillances, Al Miller; was he not a
technician, a wireman?

A. Your answer to that question is not entirely correct.
Alden Miller was an Atlanta Agent who had certain technical
ability. It is my recollection the surveillance was installed
by an Agent who was not from the Atlanta Office. I do not
remember his name.

Q. Did you monitor any of these surveillances?

\"A. No.

Q. Did you monitor any such surveillance during this period
of time?

A. Yes. I recall on two occasions filling in for another
employee in connection with telephone surveillance of the
headquarters of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
I did not monitor the King or SCLC telephone surveillance.

Q. What was the nature of the investigation of SNCC?

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 10
9

A. To determine communist influence of that organization.

\"Q. What is your recollection of the Bureau's efforts to
influence any political campaign.

A. I have no such recollection.

\"Q. What about efforts to disrupt the political campaign of
Senator Andrew Young?

\"A. I do not know of any such efforts. It's my recollection
that Andrew Young did not become actively involved in politics
during the period of time with which we are concerned.

Q. Did a former Bureau official William Sullivan visit Atlanta
during this period?

A. There were two Sullivans in an official capacity with the
Bureau.

Q. William Sullivan, who was formerly connected with intelligence
matters at the Bureau. Did you ever meet him?

A. Yes. I met him on several occasions during the 1950s.
I do not recall any contact with him during the period with
which we are presently concerned.

\"Q. After you received the King, SCLC, and Levison cases,
what did Mr. Bob Nichols do?

to Valdosta, Georgia.

Q. Can you give an example of such reference?

A. There is only one particular conversation that comes to
mind at the moment and I have no recollection with whom the
conversation was held during which reference was made to a
wonderful sermon they had preached together on somebody's
kitchen floor.

Q. Kitchen floor?

A. Yes.

Q. What surreptitious entry was made in respect to the King
residence or SCLC headquarters?

A. During the period I was concerned with these cases there
was none..

Q. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location
to use against King or SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious
entry to obtain it?

A. No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say
this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late
1950s concerning such a technique had changed.

Q. (By.Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy
had changed?

A. During my period with the Bureau, from the beginning, such
activity had to be approved by the Bureau, with reference to
the period of time, the policy had changed to the extent that
obtaining authority was virtually impossible.

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 13
12

Q. Prior to 1965 in what way were you involved in any
surreptitious entry?

A. Mr. Seidel, as I stated earlier I have been informed that
I was released by the AG to testify before this Committee
concerning King, SCLC, Stanley Levison, and matters related
thereto.

Q. Did you develop any information establishing CP connection
on the part of King?

A. Not beyond his affiliation with Levison and the other
individuals previously mentioned.

YQ. What was the objective of the investigation of King and
SCLC?

A. To determine possible communist influence of King and SCLC.

Q. If, as you state, you did not develop information that King
was a communist, was not this investigation in vain?

\"A. Not in my opinion. It is correct it did not establish that
King was a CP member. It did establish that he was in contact
with individuals then having past or present CP affiliation which
was the objective of the investigation.

Q. Do you remember during 1963 King alleged that Bureau Agents
were not responsive to civil rights complications in the vicinity
of Albany, Georgia, and other South Georgia locations?

NW-88614 Docld:32989606 Page 14
13

A. Yes, I recall news media information concerning such
allegations.

Q. In response to these allegations by King, do you remember
that Mr. Hoover became very concerned with King's allegations?

A. Yes. I definitely remember news media indicating that
Mr. Hoover was extremely upset.

Q. You have stated you were assigned to King and SCLC case in
May, 1965, is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You previously stated these cases were initiated 12 months
or perhaps a little longer prior to your receiving them. Is
that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Was there not then a connection between Director Hoover's
concern with King's statements in 1963 regarding lack of
attention to civil rights matters in South Georgia by the Bureau
and the initiation of the investigation of King and SCLC?

A. Yes I did not discuss that matter with Mr. Hoover or
any Bureau official..

Q. Do you deny there was any such connection?

A. I cannot deny that there might have been such a connection.
This was a situation in which I recall the news media on more
than one occasion suggested such to be the case.

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 15
14

Q. From 1965 until 1971 was there any electronic surveillance
of any other individual or organization in addition to King,
SCLC, and SNCC?

A. To the best of my recollection there were none except as
may have pertained to some strictly criminal investigations with
which I had no connection.

Q. What about prior to 1965?

A. There was one concerning an individual or individuals having
KLAN-King connections believed to have been involved in an earlier
church bombing, I believe in Birmingham, involving the death of
several children.

Q. During our interview in Atlanta you stated you did not have
any contact with members of the news media or clergy regarding
King or SCLC. Is that correct?

A. Yes, I did not have any such contact.

५९. What discussion was had with members of the Atlanta Police
Department concerning King, SCLC, and Levison, and what was the
extent of their electronic coverage regarding these matters?

- A. During the period of time I was concerned with King, SCLC,
Levison, I had no discussion with any member of the Atlanta
Police Department concerning these matters. Bureau instructions
regarding these matters or that any discussion was on a strictly
need-to-know basis and I have absolutely no recollection that
members of the Atlanta Police Department fitted into this category.

NW-886.14 Docld:32989606 Page 16
15

I do not have any knowledge as to what electronic surveillance
may ever have been conducted by the Atlanta Police Department.

Q. While in Atlanta you were assigned to what was referred
to as the Security and Racial Squad, is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Essentially this squad was concerned with security matters,
racial matters, is that correct?

A. Yes and it was also concerned with civil rights violations
and election law violations.

Q. In regard to civil rights and election law matters, did
you ever develop any information pertinent to the CP?

A. No.

Q. What Agents do you remember were assigned to that squad?
Charles Harding, Arthur Murtagh?

A. Yes. Those two, Alden Miller, Richard Hamilton,
Richard Davis, Donald Burgess, Randall McGough, Timothy Dorsch,
Charles Haynes.

Q. Who monitored the King and SCLC surveillance?

A. A number of different gentlemen, some of whom were periodically
transferred.

Q. Who were some of those?

A. Donald Burgess, Richard Davis, Brian O'Shea, now deceased.

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 17
16

Q. Who served in a supervisory capacity before Charles
Harding?

\"A. Henry Rouse.

Q. Where is he now?

A. I understand he retired, I do not know where he is located.

Q. What was your involvement with the Bureau's program referred
toras COINTELPRO?

A. Mr. Seidel, as I endeavored to explain on May 12, your
use of that particular terminology did not register with me
at all.

\"Q. Recently testimony was given be one or more Bureau officials
indicating this program began during the late 1950s and
continued to a fairly recent date. Did not your reports
regarding King, SCLC, or Levison include in their caption
COINTELPRO?

A. It is not my recollection that they did.

'Q. What about a Klan organization?

A. I did at various times handle investigations concerning
individual Klan members. I'did not handle the Klan as an
organizational matter. It is my recollection that in reporting
on the activities of an individual Klan member the character
of the case would have been indicated as Ku Klux Klan Racial
Matter.

NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 18
17

I feel compelled to apologize if I appear particularly
dense as to the utilization of this phrase COINTELPRO. If it
was a program operating over a period of years the only explanati on
I can offer at this moment is that conceiably some field offices
imtially
other than Atlanta were involved therein. If this was the
case, Atlanta may well have been included therein subsequent
to my departure.

Q. (John Bailey) When the telephone surveillance was discontinued
on the King residence and on SCLC who took care of that.

A. I do not know.

It should be noted the Committee took a five minute
break approximately 12:05 to 12:10 p.m. after which questioning
Continued.

Following a few very general concluding comments
by Seidel, the writer was given the opportunity to make a
statement. At this point Seidel was advised it was the writer's
understanding that the procedures of this Committee provided for
a witness to subsequently have opportunity to review the transcript
thereof, and that the writer would like to avail himself of
this opportunity. Inquiry was made as to whether this could be
accomplished via registered or certified mail to preclude unnecessary
expense to the Government.

Seidel responded at some length referring to (Section
6b?) of the Committee's rules and regulations which permitted
:
NW 88614 Docld:32989606 Page 19
18

such review in the Committee's office. Any expense thereof
to be borne by the witness. He explained it was not his
perogative to amend the Committee's rules and regulations.

The writer apologized for asking the question and
submitted that had he been furnished a copy of the Committee's
rules and regulations for a period of time longer than 29
minutes before this Committee convened, it would not have been
necessary to have asked the question.

The aforementioned session terminated shortly past
1 p.m.

Alan G. Sentinella

May 21, 1975

The following represents the writer's recollection
of testimony given this date before the Senate Select Committee
(SSC) pursuant to subpoena. The session commenced at 10 a.m.
former
5/21/75 in Room 607, Caroll Arms Hotel.
Present was Senator
Robert Morgan (North Carolina); Lester B. Seidel, Staff Member;
Mr. Jack Smith, Staff Member; Mr. John Bailey, Assistant
Minority Counsel, and a male reporter. Senator Morgan placed
the writer under oath. Approximately four or five minutes later
Senator Morgan excused himself with a general statement to
the effect he had other pressing matters. The entire proceedings
with only two exceptions were conducted by Lester B. Seidel.

Seidel explained the writer was entitled to counsel,
had the privilege of invoking provisions of the Fifth Amendment,
and would have the privilege of making an opening and closing
statement. Seidel inquired whether the writer understood his
rights and the Committee's rules and regulations, a copy of
which he had made available.

The writer acknowledged receipt of the Committee's
rules and regulations as furnished by Seidel at 9:31 a.m.
5/21/75. He also acknowledged he had been informed of the right
to counsel but inasmuch as this Committee was not understood
to constitute a grand jury and in the absence of any charges
or allegations of a violation of law on his part, he did not
insist on the presence of counsel.

Seidel was advised as a former Special Agent the
writer had contacted the Bureau's Legal Counsel Division and
as of this date had been advised by Mr. Paul Daly thereof that
he had been cleared by the Attorney General (AG) to testify
to matters relating to investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley
Levison.

\"Seidel was advised that during his interview of the
writer in Atlanta, Georgia, on 5/12/75 he had asked a question
as to how long after the assassination of King did the telephone
surveillance continue on the King residence. On 5/12/75 the
writer responded it was his recollection this coverage continued
until a short time subsequent to the assassination. Following
that interview, the writer recalled that either shortly before
or shortly after that case was assigned to the writer, the King
family had moved from one residence to another and that
continuation of the telephone surveillance from the former
residence to the latter one was not authorized. Secondly,
Seidel on 5/12/75 had asked when the King and SCLC cases were

assigned to the writer, the writer recalled such assignment
was in the early part of 1965; that it was now the writer's
recollection this assignment was made in May, 1965.

Set forth below are questions asked by Seidel (unless
otherwise indicated) and the writer's answers. These questions
and answers are not set forth chronologically.

Q. Why was continuance of the telephone surveillance
not continued to the Kings' new residence?

A. Continuance was not authorized by the AG.

\"Q. What telephone surveillance was there conducted by
Atlanta of Stanley Levison?

A. There was no such coverage per se only such as afforded
by contacts made of King or members of the SCLC staff by
Levison.

Q. Was there telephone surveillance of Levison in New York?

\"A. Any contacts of King by Levison while in New York would
have been covered.

Q. Did the New York Office maintain telephone surveillance
of Levison?

A. I do not directly know.

Q. During the Atlanta interview you indicated you had read
New York reports concerning Levison. Is that correct?

\"A. Yes.

↑ Q. During Atlanta interview you indicated you presumed
these reports set forth information concerning Levison from
a telephone surveillance. Is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. What was the basis for your presumption?

A. The appropriate administrative portion of such report
would have so indicated.

Q. What evidence of CP connections did your investigation
develop concerning Levison?

\"A. None.

Q. What information did you have establishing CP connection
re Levison?

A. Such information as was set forth in what was then referred
to as a characterization of Levison. Such characterization was
a part of each report submitted to the Bureau.

Q. What was the nature of this characterization?

A. I do not remember the precise language. It is my recollection
the statement was brief and set forth information establishing
past and/or present CP affiliation by Levison.

Q. Where did you obtain this characterization?

Α. A characterization of an individual or organization at
that time was prepared by the field office concerned, submitted

to Bureau Headquarters for its approval, and such was made
available to offices having a need-to-know this information.

Q. What was the source of this information regarding Levison.

A. I do not recall that I was ever, apprised thereof. A
characterization would not indicate the source of the information,
unless public source information was utilized, otherwise the
reliability or lack thereof of the source or sources would be
indicated but not their identity.

\"Q. What prompted you today to amend your answer on May the 12th
75 as to how long telephone surveillance continued on the King
residence? Did you seek the advice or an answer from someone?

\"A. To the extent that subsequent to May the 12th I conferred
with a former Agent, Charles Harding, prior thereto
prior to that time-which-it
to that question
had concerned me, that my initial answer for some reason did not
impress me as being completely correct. I mentioned this to
Harding and he informed me that my answer was incorrect and
mentioned the change in the King residence and the fact coverage
had not been thereafter authorized. When he informed me of
this I immediately récalled the change in residence which
previously had escaped my memory.

Q. Why would Harding know this information?

A. For a period of time he was in a supervisory capacity.

Q. Was he in a supervisory capacity when the change in
residence was made?

\"A. He was in a relief supervisory capacity at that time.

Q. Why did you rely on Harding's recollection? Is his recollection
better than yours?

A. I am not suggesting his recollection is better or worse
than mine. What he said to me merely served to jog my memory
upon which I based my earlier statement today.

Q. You recall when I interviewed you in Atlanta most of
my questions were taken from prepared notes.

A. Yes.

\"Q. You recall that I told you that I would make notes during
the interview in order that I might later refresh my recollection
as to your testimony.

A. Yes, and Mr. Seidel, you recall that I did not take any
notes (to which he answered in the affirmative).

Q. Did you make any recording of that interview at the time?

A. I did not.

Q. Did you make any subsequent written recording of the
interview?

\"A. Yes, I did so for my personal information.

1
Q. Is such writing available to this Committee?

A. I consider it a personal item for my personal use.
I realize that you have the perogative of subpoenaing it.
In the absence thereof, I prefer not to make it available.

\"Q. How long after King's assassination did the telephone
surveillance of SCLC continue?

A. I cannot be certain. It continued for a period of time
which may have been one, two, possibly three months. I simply
do not remember.

い
Q. Who handled SCLC and Levison case after you left the Bureau?

A. Richard Hamilton.

Q. When did he assume these cases?

\"A. I cannot recall precisely. I am not even sure whether they
had been administratively reassigned to him prior to my departure.

Q. Who else besides Stanley Levison was in contact with King
who you understood to have some type of CP connections?

A. There was Hunter Pitts O'Dell, Bayard Rustin, and Harry
Wachtel.

Q. Hunter Pitts O'Dell, the same as Jack O'Dell?

A. Yes, he was.

Q. What evidence of CP connections or domination by Moscow of
O'Dell, Rustin, Wachtel, did your investigation develop?

A. It did not develop any such information.

Q. How did you know of whatever their CP affiliation may
have been?

A. In the same manner as in regard to Levison.

\"Q. What investigation did Atlanta conduct of O'Dell, Rustin,
and Wachtel?

\"A. There was no active ongoing investigation conducted of
these individuals other than during such periods when they were
in contact with King or members of SCLCX

\"Q. Was Coretta King ever the target of an electronic surveillance?

A. Not to my knowledge beyond such coverage as might have occurred
from the telephone surveillance when it applied to the King
residence or on such occasions when she might have been present
in SCLC headquarters.

Q. Do you know when the telephone surveillance of King and
SCLC were initiated?

A. I did not have the cases at that time.

Q. Did you not learn of such information while you had these
cases?

A. Yes.

Q. How?
V
A. From information in the appropriate file.

Q. What communication transpired between the Bureau and
Atlanta relative to the initiation of these telephone surveillances,

airtels, letters, memoranda?

A. I am certain there were airtels, letters, possibly
teletypes in the file..
g
Q. What was the fist of such communications?

\"A. Advisement that such installation had been authorized,
instructions to initiate the coverage.

1
Q. Who installed the surveillances, Al Miller; was he not a
technician, a wireman?

A. Your answer to that question is not entirely correct.
Alden Miller was an Atlanta Agent who had certain technical
ability. It is my recollection the surveillance was installed
by an Agent who was not from the Atlanta Office. I do not
remember his name.

Q. Did you monitor any of these surveillances?

\"A. No.

Q. Did you monitor any such surveillance during this period
of time?

A. Yes. I recall on two occasions filling in for another
employee in connection with telephone surveillance of the
headquarters of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
I did not monitor the King or SCLC telephone surveillance.

Q. What was the nature of the investigation of SNCC?

A. To determine communist influence of that organization.

\"Q. What is your recollection of the Bureau's efforts to
influence any political campaign.

A. I have no such recollection.

\"Q. What about efforts to disrupt the political campaign of
Senator Andrew Young?

\"A. I do not know of any such efforts. It's my recollection
that Andrew Young did not become actively involved in politics
during the period of time with which we are concerned. (SEE ITEM I.
of attached pages

Q. Did a former Bureau official William Sullivan visit Atlanta
during this period?

A. There were two Sullivans in an official capacity with the
Bureau.

Q. William Sullivan, who was formerly connected with intelligence
matters at the Bureau. Did you ever meet him?

A. Yes. I met him on several occasions during the 1950s.
I do not recall any contact with him during the period with
which we are presently concerned.

\"Q. After you received the King, SCLC, and Levison cases,
what did Mr. Bob Nichols do?

A. Shortly thereafter he was transferred as a Resident Agent
to Valdosta, Georgia.

Q. Can you give an example of such reference?

A. There is only one particular conversation that comes to
mind at the moment and I have no recollection with whom the
conversation was held during which reference was made to a
wonderful sermon they had preached together on somebody's
kitchen floor.

Q. Kitchen floor?

A. Yes.

Q. What surreptitious entry was made in respect to the King
residence or SCLC headquarters?

A. During the period I was concerned with these cases there
was none..

Q. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location
to use against King or SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious
entry to obtain it?

A. No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say
this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late
1950s concerning such a technique had changed.

Q. (By.Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy
had changed?

A. During my period with the Bureau, from the beginning, such
activity had to be approved by the Bureau, with reference to
when
the period of time, the policy had changed to the extent that
obtaining authority was virtually impossible.

Q. Prior to 1965 in what way were you involved in any
surreptitious entry?

A. Mr. Seidel, as I stated earlier I have been informed that
I was released by the AG to testify before this Committee
concerning King, SCLC, Stanley Levison, and matters related
thereto.

Q. Did you develop any information establishing CP connection
on the part of King?

A. Not beyond his affiliation with Levison and the other
individuals previously mentioned.

YQ. What was the objective of the investigation of King and
SCLC?

A. To determine possible communist influence of King and SCLC.

Q. If, as you state, you did not develop information that King
was a communist, was not this investigation in vain?

\"A. Not in my opinion. It is correct it did not establish that
King was a CP member. It did establish that he was in contact
with individuals then having past or present CP affiliation which
was the objective of the investigation. See ITEM III. of attached.
pages.

Q. Do you remember during 1963 King alleged that Bureau Agents
were not responsive to civil rights complications in the vicinity
of Albany, Georgia, and other South Georgia locations?

A. Yes, I recall news media information concerning such
allegations.

Q. In response to these allegations by King, do you remember
that Mr. Hoover became very concerned with King's allegations?
the
A. Yes. I definitely remember news media indicating that
Mr. Hoover was extremely upset.

۸
Q. You have stated you were assigned to King and SCLC case in
May, 1965, is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You previously stated these cases were initiated 12 months
or perhaps a little longer prior to your receiving them. Is
that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Was there not then a connection between Director Hoover's
concern with King's statements in 1963 regarding lack of
attention to civil rights matters in South Georgia by the Bureau
and the initiation of the investigation of King and SCLC?

A. Yes I did not discuss that matter with Mr. Hoover or with
any Bureau official..

attiche Q. Do you deny there was any such connection?
pages A. I cannot deny that there might have been such a connection.
This was a situation in which I recall the news media on more
than one occasion suggested such to be the case.

९. From 1965 until 1971 was there any electronic surveillance
of any other individual or organization in addition to King,
SCLC, and SNCC?

A. To the best of my recollection there were none except as
may have pertained to some strictly criminal investigations with
which I had no connection.

Q. What about prior to 1965?

A. There was one concerning an individual or individuals having
KLAN-King connections believed to have been involved in an earlier
church bombing, I believe in Birmingham, involving the death of
several children.

\"Q. During our interview in Atlanta you stated you did not have
any contact with members of the news media or clergy regarding
King or SCLC. Is that correct?

A. Yes, I did not have any such contact.

५९. What discussion was had with members of the Atlanta Police
Department concerning King, SCLC, and Levison, and what was the
extent of their electronic coverage regarding these matters?

- A. During the period of time I was concerned with King, SCLC,
wire
Levison, I had no discussion with any member of the Atlanta
Police Department concerning these matters. Bureau instructions
regarding these matters or that any discussion was on a strictly
need-to-know basis and I have absolutely no recollection that
members of the Atlanta Police Department fitted into this category.

I do not have any knowledge as to what electronic surveillance
may ever have been conducted by the Atlanta Police Department.

Q. While in Atlanta you were assigned to what was referred
to as the Security and Racial Squad, is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Essentially this squad was concerned with security matters,
racial matters, is that correct?

A. Yes and it was also concerned with civil rights violations
and election law violations.

Q. In regard to civil rights and election law matters, did
you ever develop any information pertinent to the CP?

A. No.

Q. What Agents do you remember were assigned to that squad?
Charles Harding, Arthur Murtagh?

A. Yes. Those two, Alden Miller, Richard Hamilton,
Richard Davis, Donald Burgess, Randall McGough, Timothy Dorsch,
Charles Haynes.

Q. Who monitored the King and SCLC surveillance?

A. A number of different gentlemen, some of whom were periodically
transferred.

Q. Who were some of those?

A. Donald Burgess, Richard Davis, Brian O'Shea, now deceased.

Q. Who served in a supervisory capacity before Charles
Harding?

\"A. Henry Rouse.

Q. Where is he now?

A. I understand he retired, I do not know where he is located.

Q. What was your involvement with the Bureau's program referred
toras COINTELPRO?

A. Mr. Seidel, as I endeavored to explain on May 12, your
use of that particular terminology did not register with me
at all.

\"Q. Recently testimony was given be one or more Bureau officials
indicating this program began during the late 1950s and
continued to a fairly recent date. Did not your reports
regarding King, SCLC, or Levison include in their caption
COINTELPRO?

A. It is not my recollection that they did.

'Q. What about a Klan organization?

A. I did at various times handle investigations concerning
individual Klan members. I'did not handle the Klan as an
organizational matter. It is my recollection that in reporting
on the activities of an individual Klan member the character
of the case would have been indicated as Ku Klux Klan Racial
Matter.

I feel compelled to apologize if I appear particularly
dense as to the utilization of this phrase COINTELPRO. If it
was a program operating over a period of years the only explanati on
I can offer at this moment is that conceiably some field offices
imtially
other than Atlanta were involved therein. If this was the
case, Atlanta may well have been included therein subsequent
to my departure.

Q. (John Bailey) When the telephone surveillance was discontinued
on the King residence and on SCLC who took care of that.

A. I do not know.

It should be noted the Committee took a five minute
break approximately 12:05 to 12:10 p.m. ofter which questioning.
Continued.

Following a few very general concluding comments
by Seidel, the writer was given the opportunity to make a
statement. At this point Seidel was advised it was the writer's
understanding that the procedures of this Committee provided for
a witness to subsequently have opportunity to review the transcript
thereof, and that the writer would like to avail himself of
this opportunity. Inquiry was made as to whether this could be
accomplished via registered or certified mail to preclude unnecessary
expense to the Government.

Seidel responded at some length referring to (Section
6b?) of the Committee's rules and regulations which permitted

such review in the Committee's office. Any expense thereof assurd
to be borne by the witness. He explained it was not his
perogative to amend the Committee's rules and regulations.

The writer apologized for asking the question and
submitted that had he been furnished a copy of the Committee's
rules and regulations for a period of time longer than 29
minutes before this Committee convened, it would not have been
necessary to have asked the question.

The aforementioned session terminated shortly past

PSI Elio Quintero (protect identity) (97-4313), 153 N.E.
44th Street, Miami, advised on 7/29/60 that he had been serving in
a liaison capacity with the MRR and prospective defectee pilots of
Cuban airlines. His operations were directed by Dr. Manuel Artime
Buesa, an ex-Lieutenant of the Cuban Revolutionary Army who now was
serving as Secretary General of the MRR. Quintero was in daily
telephonic contact with Salvador Aldereguia and Antonio Bascaro,
two members of the Cuban Revolutionary Army who were in exile in the
Dutch West Indies, and through Artime was attempting to arrange for
their admission into the US.

[In July, 1960 there was dissension in the MRR leadership
which consisted of Ricardo Lorie, Higinio \"Nino\" Diaz, Antonio
Michel Yabor and Manuel Artime Buesa. Artime, who represented the
MRR on the FRD Executive Committee, reportedly was aligned with the
political group of Manuel Antonio de Varona, Aurelio Sanchez Arango
and Justo Carrillo. The dissident group, Lorie, Diaz and Yabor,
who were not accepted by the FRD, aligned themselves with the
Liberation Alliance which was formed in Miami on 8/7/60, and claimed
they were the true MRR organization. A paid political announcement
in the 8/2/60 issue of the \"Diario Las Americas\" stated that Jose
Ignacio Rasco Bermudez, a secretary of the FRD Executive Committee,
certified that the only MRR duly accredited representative of that
organization to the FRD was Manuel Artime. The National Board of
the MRR in Cuba, backed by the FRD, reportedly approved the reorgan-

Father Medina, Rector of Villanueva University, Havana, arrived in
Miami from Havana, on 9/5/60, for the purpose of contacting
Cajigas and offering him the help and resources of the Catholic
Church in Cuba in his fight against Castro. Fernandez said that,

Marquez Sterling that Antonio (Tony) Varona was coming to Washington,
DC on 9/16/60, where he planned to confer with officials of the
Department of State and CIA concerning the eventual unification of
the various anti-Castro groups then in existence. At that time,
Varona was to discuss what assistance this group might expect from
the US and he also would provide the identity of various anti-Castro
groups known to him. Among persons under consideration by Sterling,
Varona, and others, for inclusion in this unified organization was
Artime Buesa. According to Loys, Sterling had been a Cuban president-
ial aspirant, during the election of 1958 and Varona was a former
Cuban Senator now in exile in Miami, Florida.

On 1/2/62, Philadelphia SOI Enrique Menocal (protect

founded originally by Manuel Artime (date not indicated) and was
composed largely of Catholic students in Cuba. Menocal said that
November 30th was the date on which Huber Matos, former military

The MRR, an underground movement formed in Cuba in mid-1959,
was composed primarily of three larger groups: (1) the ACU, under
Manuel F. Artime Buesa; (2) a military group under Major Ricardo
de la Lorie Valls; and (3) an air group, without planes, of 13
experienced pilots under Major Antonio Michel Yabor. The ACU was in
existence prior to the Castro regime as the Cuban Catholic University
(CACU) students organization. In November, 1959, under Artime's
leadership, the majority of the CACU membership joined with the
Rebel Army Officer group to become the MRR. In February, 1950, a
coordinated movement of anti-Castro exiles outside Cuba was formed
in Mexico and named the MRR. Artime and Lorie were joint heads of
this newly formed group. About the middle of 1960, Artime, who was
in the US, reportedly began to act without authority from the MRR
Directorate, which resulted in formation of the MRR splinter group,

Cuba since the ill-fated 4/17/61 Playa Giron invasion.

On 12/29/62, President John F. Kennedy visited the Orange
Bowl Stadium, Miami, where he reviewed the returned prisoners of
Brigade 2506. He was accompanied by Jose Miro Cardona and Manuel
Artime, both of whom were on the speakers' stand with President
Kennedy.

After Artime's return to the US, he used his influence with
the US Government to obtain an interview with President Kennedy in
Palm Beach, Florida. He was to continue as head of the MRR. Artime
made a good appearance, spoke English, and had charmed US Government
officials who were in charge of government policy between the US
and Cuba. He was extremely ambitious and would like to be the head
of the CRC and probably the future President of Cuba. (Higinio
\"Nino\" Diaz, supra, 1/4/63).

As a result of nationwide press, radio, and television
coverage of President Kennedy's 12/29/62 activities at the Orange
Bowl, which coverage prominently mentioned Artime's name, Artime
now was better known and his position in the anti-Fidel Castro
movement was greatly increased. Generally among Cuban exiles Artime
was considered young, immature, and highly ambitious, and many felt
that he considered the victim of his own publicity.

The 1/6/63 issue of the \"Miami Herald\" carried an article
entitled \"Rift Develops in Invasion Brigade; 100 Boycotted JFK Here.\"
This related to boycott by Cuban Brigade 2506 (105-117331) prisoners
of President Kennedy's 12/29/62 appearance at the Orange Bowl to
welcome the returned prisoners. The article stated that Enrique
Llaca, Jr., recently released from Castro's prisons, singled out
Manuel Artime and Dr. Jose Miro Cardona, head of the CRC, for
criticism, declaring they were using the Brigade for their personal
benefits. Both Artime and Miro Cardona denied this. The Brigade,
under the leadership of Artime and a joint chiefs of staff, had set
up headquarters in Miami.

final battle is very near.\"

On 1/9/63, MM 492-S advised that 24 hours after being

[In May, 1961 Fidel Castro offered to exchange a number of
Cuban prisoners taken during the 4/17/61 invasion attempt, for US
tractors and spare parts for same. Eliminated from the proposed
tractor exchange deal were the three leaders of the invasion
Manuel Artime, Jose San Roman and Rafael Bolivar Fuentes. The
Cuban Government proposed the exchange of Artime for Francisco
\"The Hook\" Molina, a pro-Castro Cuban who had been convicted of
second-degree murder in NYC. However, this proposed exchange failed
to materialize and in late March early April 1962, in Havana, Cuba,
the prisoners were tried before a 5-man military tribunal and con-
victed. The verdict involved heavy ransoms with the ransom for
Artime set at $500,000. Subsequently, the US carried out negotiations
for release of the prisoners and on 12/23-24/62 they all were air-
lifted to Miami. Artime, the civil representative of the CRC, re-
portedly had emerged as a focal figure in the exile community. At
a press conference on 12/25/62, he emphasized that all the returned
prisoners regarded themselves as the \"troops of the Revolutionary
Council.\" Artime declined to discuss the military aspects of the
abortive invasion. He said that he and the other ransomed prisoners
were determined to return to Cuba. As of 1/21/63, INS, Miami, was
beginning to process the prisoners. CIA, Miami, had contact with
Brigade 2506 leaders Artime, Jose Perez San Roman and Eneido Oliva
as sources of information to keep abreast of Brigade 2506 moods

Miami Office report dated 4/30/63, set out information
indicating that during January, 1963, some MRR (97-4133) functionaries
participated in unity discussions with other Cuban revolutionary
organizations. The MRR problem was complicated by the recent return
to the US from imprisonment in Cuba, of Manuel Artime Buesa, MRR
leader who had participated in the April, 1961 invasion attempt.
In late January, 1963, Jose Miro Cardona, head of the CRC, tried to
overthrow the MRR leadership of Artime. On 2/22/63, at a meeting
held by the Enrique Oviedo Leon faction of the MRR (place not indi-
cated), Artime was expelled and Oviedo was named MRR Secretary
General. A document (quoted) entitled \"Removal and Expulsion of
Dr. Manuel Artime Buesa\" was made available by MM 492-S. On 4/23/63,
Manuel Villamanan (protect identity), Cuban exile in Miami, said
that Artime still was undisputed head of the MRR; that about 75% of
Brigade 2506 was sympathetic with the MRR; that Erneido Oliva of
Brigade 2506 was very close to Artime and in agreement with Artime on both
the military and political aspects of the fight against communism in
Cuba; and that the MRR was not making clandestine trips to Cuba at
that time. (Details set out).

It was reported on 1/22/64 that no further conversations
between former Nicaraguan President Luis Somoza and former Cuban
President Carlos Prio Socarras were known to have taken place con-
cerning \"Operacion Centroamericana\"*. This project continued to be
at a standstill and activities of Manuel Artime, MRR leader, apparently
were not connected with it, although no open break with Prio had been
made. Artime was slowly strengthening and training a group of exiles
in Nicaragua. The MRP (105-92704) claimed that Artime was receiving
aid from the Nicaraguan Government and from the US.

The Alliance of MRP Alpha 66 SFNE would consider joining
forces with Artime when his organization had developed sufficient
strength to make an attack on Cuba feasible.

of Cuban exiles recruited out of the US Army for service with his
group; the alleged grand style of living of Artime and his follo
and his operation of training camps in Nicaragua where he reporte
had more than five million dollars worth of military equipment. It
was alleged that Artime was being officially sponsored and subsidized
and that he made a living out of the revolution. In early 1964, when
the Pro-Referendum Committee was polling the Cuban exiles for a Cuban
referendum election to be held in May, Artime was reported to be
against this referendum. Reference also set out information reported

ransomed prisoners of the April, 1961 Cuban invasion and had returned
to the US on 12/24/62. He stated that the support of the US to the
Cuban invasion and its support to the movement of Cuban exile leader
Manuel Artime in Central America, were two events which precluded
prosecution of Cuban exiles for violation of neutrality. DeTorres
said it was general information among Cuban exiles in Miami that

visited Washington, DC and Miami, Florida, returned to the New York
area. While in Miami they tried to see Manuel Artime but he was in
Central America. Instead, they saw Antonio Iglesia Pons, who was in

their own in the event Fidel Castro was overthrown in the near future
by anti-Castro forces that were not followers of Batista. It was felt
that this group feared Manuel Artime and desired to formulate plans
to be able to re-enter Cuba because it was common knowledge that
some Batista supporters would be regarded as undesirables in Cuba

\"The Washington Post and Times Herald\", 5/30/64, p.B-7,
in an article entitled \"Cuba's Oil Refineries 'Off Limits\" in
Jack Anderson's \"Washington Merry-Go-Round\" column, reported that
these orders regarding the refineries were issued to Cuban Commandos
by CIA. An aide to Cuban exile leader Manuel Artime had explained
to this column: \"We don't want to damage foreign property.\" A year
before, Artime had complained to this column that CIA had cut the
allowance for his freedom fighters down to a token $1000 a month.
He hadn't complained recently.

CIA (protect identity) advised on 5/14/64 that the MRR was
not a CIA operation. CIA at the direction of \"Special Group\" had
been furnishing support to the MRR and its leader, Manuel Artime, and
had been maintaining liaison with him on a regular basis. CIA dis-
claimed control over the MRR and Artime.

On 6/17/64, Gordon (Rock) Rothwell (protect identity),
Covert CIA Representative, Miami, Florida identified Angel Alfredo
Fontanills Y Miguel (105-129278) as being connected with Manuel
Artime and the MRR.

Information from Mesa, developed through his interpreter, James A.
Kraker(protect identity) of Crystal, Minnesota, indicated that as
of December, 1963, the MRR was reported to be sending a 5-man team
into Cuba once a month for the purpose of assassination, with Fidel
and Raul Castro and Che Guevara as the principal targets. Communi-
cations between Cuba and the US allegedly were through clandestine
short wave radio. Mesa returned to Minneapolis on 1/5/64, from a
visit to Miami where he failed to see Artime who was in Puerto Rico.
Mesa advised Kraker that Artime probably would spend more time in
Venezuela in 1964. According to Kraker, the MRR in the Twin Citiess
area was disbanded in July, 1964, upon orders of Manuel Artime

Cuban exiles were saying that the US was providing a steady
flow of aid to the MRR which was led by Manuel Artime Buesa. Some
exiles claimed that the MRR attack on Puerto Pilon in May 1964, was
launched from the Dominican Republic. There was no evidence that
Artime was receiving support from the Venezuelan Government. His
failure to establish personal contact with the Venezuelan Administra-
tion during his 5/22-27/64 visit to Caracas, had provoked criticism
in government circles. Some disillusionment with the MRR was said
to be caused by Artime's failure to establish himself as the undis-
puted leader of the militant exile forces. (CIA, 7/16/64)

placing himself in absolute control without heeding the ideological
postulates of the movement; and his failure to live up to the stand-
ards he had set up for the organization.

The \"Miami News\", Miami, Florida, 7/5/64, reported that
on the previous day, Artime ordered all his men to report to South..
American training camps immediately.

On 7/9/64, M.H. Redmon (protect identity), INS Investigator,
Miami, advised that the MRR had closed its Miami headquarters and
moved to Central America, but had established a secret underground
office somewhere in Miami. On 8/4/64, Redmon stated that numerous
MRR members went to Central America to join Artime during July, 1964
and that the MRR claimed it would move all of its records and
equipment out of Miami by chartered airplane to Artime's headquarters
in Central America. The MRR had a large ship that operated between
Central America and New Orleans, Louisiana. The ship, name unknown,
was operated by a cover company using letterhead stationery containing
the following: \"Maritima Bom, S.A., Coconut Grove Bank Building, Suite
309, Miami, Florida, Phone # 444-5781-82.\" This company also claimed
to have Post Office boxes in Panama.and Nicaragua. Sixto Mesa was

On 7/28/64, Carlos Zarraga Martinez (protect identity), PSI
under development, advised that the rank and file MRR members continued
to severely criticize Artime for maintaining his mistress, Adelaida
Padron Cruz. She reportedly had great influence over Artime and some
of his decisions concerning the MRR's operations had been influenced
by her and objected to by the general membership

On 8/18/64, Miguel Dotres, 8418 N.W. 24th Avenue, Miami,
advised that in late March or early April, 1964, Aldo Vera Serafin,
head of an anti-Castro organization (not further identified), con-
ferred with Artime and brought his organization into Artime's organ-
ization. Dotres furnished information indicating that Artime was
against Baro's proposal that the MRR be headed by a 7-man board; also.
that the Cuban exile community doubted that Artime was a factor which
eventually would figure in the overthrow of the present Cuban Govern-
ment.

His Excellency has received your cable.

You have left His Excellency's office with the impression
(B val that he) was willing to offer the new Ambassador the
most loyal and frank collaboration.

However, a certain stiffening has characterized the first
contact between TIMMONS and Foreign Minister CHALMERS and
Deputy Foreign Minister RAYMOND at the Foreign Ministry

least qualified at the present time and that his presence could
be fatal for the resumption of relations.

Please make contact with Mr. IRVING DAVIDSON((B)),

\"The Haitian Government has had to request of Charge
d'Affaires CURTIS the recall of three United States Embassy
officials, JOHN W WARREN, Military Attache, STANLEY D. MOSS
Cultural Attache, and JOHN HASEC((C)), Political Counsellor.
The State Department replied that the new Ambassador has been

credentials, but that these officials will not be recalled
unless they are declared personae non grata, and that the State
Department will make reprisals.

John Hasey

Please explain to you know who the necessity of making
a cleaning-out of the Embassy so that Haitian-United States
relations may be resumed on a friendly and cordial basis.

The three officials have figured in the arousing of a
frankly hostile feeling toward the Haitian Government.
Military Attache WARREN has talked with high-ranking officers
of the Haitian Army in an effort to corrupt them and hatch
a plot against this Government. JOHN HASEC, a former member
of the Foreign Legion who came here directly from Viet Nam,
has no visible in the Embassy. He is drunk morning,

noon and night. We suspect that he has some special assignment.
He has talked about it in the course of conversations at the
Hotel El Rancho. Cultural Attache MOSS is a declared enemy of
the Haitian Government. The latest number of the magazine
\"Actualites\", edited by the U.S. Embassy Cultural Service in
memory of KENNEDY is an illustration of his spirit of
hostility. At his clear choice only intellectuals who are
enemies of this Government collaborated on this number. It
contained cables of condolence from many chiefs of state, but
not that of President DUVALIER. There was no mention of the
manifestations of numerous organizations in memory of KENNEDY,
as, for example, the three days of mourning, the funeral
service, etc.

We are requesting the departure also of NORMAN WARNER
because of the categorical position of opposition to this
Government which he took during the events of April and May.

Ambassador TIMMONS has produced a bad impression. He
seems to be the man least fitted to work for a Haitian-United
States rapprochement on a durable basis. We believe it would
be advisable that he be recalled even before he presents his
credentials and that a political personage of blended spirit
who is capable of understanding be designated.

Report immediately on the result of your demarches.\"

THEARD is requested to explain to Mr. IRVING the United
States position on recall and reprisals and to keep the Haitian
Government informed constantly.

FR New York: TEDDY [KOLLEK), SHIMONA 4 Nov 58
TO Jerusalem: MEMI [de] SHALIT, VITIA BENNAHUM b
MEMROSH

We met DEVOSKIN today. He is interested in renewing nego-
tiations on Nordau Plaza.d In his opinion the construction costs,
including working capital, will amount to $1,350,000, and there-
fore the total expenses will amount to $2,350,000 to $2,400,000.
DEVOSKIN and his group are ready to invest $1,100,000. If
CHACHAMOV stays in, and his investment is estimated at $500,000;
then we still lack $750,000 to $800,000.

Please find out from [ZVI]a
a. whether the government is prepared to increase the
loan to 1,200,000 pounds, which is about $675,000, on the assump-
tion that DEVOSKIN will increase to $1,200,000.

b. whether CHACHAMOV, in the event that DEVOSKIN will
invest $1,200,000 and will pay all the creditors, will agree to
accept 30 per cent of the shares instead of 45 per cent as was
stated between him and DEVCROSKICKANS. Another difficulty with
DEVOSKIN is that he does not want to deal with creditors but wants
to take on everything unencumbered, except for the CHACHAMOV matter.
We hope that if the increase of the government loan goes through
it will influence him to increase his investment to 1,200,000 and
to get along with the creditors. CHACHAMOV should by no means be
encouraged to come here until the matter is completed. We are
meeting with DEVOSKIN on Thursday morning, 6 November.

a -- Not identified.
b Probably V. BENNAHUM of the Government Tourist Corp.
c Not identified but referred to in H-19022, 27 Oct 58. There

vestigation being conducted in Chicago.

FLA
The following information relates to recent
bombing activity in the Miami area perpetrated by Miami
hoodlums, the principal suspect being FRANK \"LEFTY\"
ROSENTHAL, alleged Lieutenant of YARAS. It is noted in

LCN, to organize certain bookmakers in the Miami area.

Information below relates to contacts with LUIS
POSADA CARRILES in regard to his knowledge of the activi-
ties of captioned individual. At the time of original

POSADA advised that DIEGO BORGES was acting as
an agent for three Americans who were seeking to buy
pistols, explosives, blasting caps, hand grenades and
silencers. The identity of the Americans was not known
to POSADA although he believed they were members of the
Ku Klux Klan or possibly the Jom Birch Society.

POSADA provided the following background in-
formation concerning individuals involved with BORGES
in the procurement of arms and munitions by the three
Americams: (S)(4)
:

HERMINIO DIAZ, 732_N.W. 3rd Street, Miami,
Florida, sold sixty hand grenades (USMK II) to BORGES
for delivery to Americans. DIAZ received from BORGES
three hundred sixty dollars for grenades but delivered
only forty. Subsequently, BORGES asked source to go to
DIAZ and either pick up other twenty grenades or the one
hundred twenty dollars in cash which they represented,
MIAMI, FL
RAMON ESCARDA, 620 S.W. 9th Street, who served
in the U. S. Army, 1958-1959, was supposed to obtain one
hundred pounds of pentolite for delivery to BORGES for
$320-350(8)(1) SECRET

FRANK TAMAYO, 3213 S.W. 8th Street, Miami, active
in anti-CASTRO/activities, sold 622 caliber silencers to
Americans for $1,000

Source gave descriptions of the three Americans
and also recorded license plate ce of car utilized by group

FLA.
On October 23, 1965, POSADA interviewed by Bureau
Agents. FOSADA readily admitted he had been in contact
with three Americans who were seeking to purchase hand
grenades, weapons, silencers and explosives. He/had been
placed in contact with these Americans by DIEGO BORGES. He
confirmed DIAZ, ESCARDA and TAMAYO were also involved in
this transaction. POSADA said shortly after he established
contact with Americans, his CIA contact gave him several
photos in attempt to identify Americans. POSADA said he
identified one of the photos as that of FRANK ROSENTHAL.
Immediately after he identified this photo, CIA instructed
him to break off all contact with these three Americans
and to have nothing further to do with them,

POSADA said that six silencers which had been
manufactured at the home of TAMAYO had been given by
BORGES to ROSENTHAL. He said ESCARDA was looking for
pentolite but did not know whether material delivered
to ROSENTHAL (S4) (4) SECRET

On November 5, 1965, Bureau Agents exhibited
photo of NORMAN ROTHMAN, FBI #152 585B, to POSADA.
POSADA identified ROTHMAN as one of Americans with
ROSENTHAL. He was of the impression that ROTHMAN was
personally known to BORGES and had introduced ROSENTHAL
to BORGES. It is noted ROTHMAN was arrested April 9,
1959, and was later convicted of violation of the National
Stolen Property Act. He was sentenced to five years in
prison and ten thousand dollar fine.( fine.(4)

2. By similar communication, dated June 15,
1967, CIA advised the Miami Division that POSADA had been
contacted by FRANK ROSENTHAL during the month of October,
1966. (1) (4)

ROSENTHAL told POSADA that all silencers he had
purchased from POSADA were pieces of junk and he felt
POSADA and BORGES were responsible for this and maybe his
friends would kill POSADA and BORGES.(54) ($)(U)

ROSENTHAL stated although he was out $5,000 from
his previous purchases, he did not want money from POSADA.
ROSENTHAL said he knew POSADA was working for CIA and he
wanted some CIA equipment. POSADA allegedly refused to do
this but POSADA made a number of fuse devices which he gave
to ROSENTHAL.
(14)

This same memo reflects ROSENTHAL contacted
POSADA in early June, 1967. ROSENTHAL stated the fuse
devices were no good which were previously furnished and
made a request for more CIA fuse devices and remote con-
trol unit for detonating explosive charges (54)

equipment and told source he would get him if he did not
deliver. POSADA refused to do anything more for ROSENTHAL,

POSADA, at this time, reiterated his past deal-
ings with FRANK ROSENTHAL from the time of the Spring of
1965, through June 12, 1967. POSADA made one additional
remark concerning his involvement with ROSENTHAL during
1965. He stated that he did not directly furnish ROSENTHAL
any of the explosives, et al, which he requested although
he was introduced to ROSENTHAL as an expert in the field
of explosives. For his expertise knowledge he was given
$500 by ROSENTHAL sometime during the month of May, 1965.
POSADA indicated that he gave this money to CIA, who in
turn at a later date gave this money back to him.

telephonically contacted by POSADA. POSADA related that
on June 22, 1967, he met with FRANK ROSENTHAL. Subject

of pencil type devices and a remote control explosive
apparatus. ROSENTHAL stated to source that money was no

would be at least twenty more bombings and additional
corpses would be appearing in the Miami area. Subject

On June 14, 1962, Colonel Rene Tallichet, Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), made reference to National Security
Agency (NSA) message 3/0 CUD/T536-62, Havana to Washington, dated[CTS]
June 7, 1962. This deals with a communication between the Cuban
Foreign Ministry and the Czech Embassy concerning the granting of [CTS]
a Cuban visa to a U. S. citizen named George Spellmeyer, owner of
the fishing boat \"Teresa y Julia. Per NSA letter 2/27/98. mde

Colonel Tallichet] advised that on June 14, 1962, CIA
had received sensitive information covering communications within
the Cuban Government. One of these intercepted communications has
disclosed that the aforementioned fishing boat was leaving Havana
for the Isle of Pines (location of Cuban prison). [Tallichet pointed
out that it appears most unusual that a fishing boat owned by a U. S.
citizen would be involved in such activity.

ACTION: The above information is being directed to the attention
of the Nationalities Intelligence Section.

FROM: Robert Olsen
RO

SUBJECT: Interview of March 4, 1975, with E. Howard Hunt
and his Daughter, Lisa Hunt

The interview commenced at approximately 4:00 PM and was conducted
at 712 Jackson Place.

Mr. Hunt is presently residing at 1245 N. E. 82th Street, Miami, Florida
33138. He has a silent telephone number of 305 758-6159.

Lisa Hunt resides at 3406 Nimitz Road, Apt. A-2, Kensington, Maryland
20795. She has an unlisted telephone number which she declined to
give us. She was born on March 9, 1951.

The interview concerned allegations that Mr. Hunt was involved in the
assassination of President John Kennedy and other public figures. He
is aware of the public statements made by Dick Gregory and Ralph
Schoenman in early February 1975 relative to his being involved in the
assassination of President Kennedy. He states that most of the infor-
mation that Mr. Gregory and Mr. Schoenman referred to is drawn from
a book by Tad Szulc entitled, E. Howard Hunt, the Compulsive Spy.
Hunt states that the book is saturated with errors. One of those errors
is the claim that Hunt was Chief of Station in Mexico City in the fall of
1963.

The Bay of Pigs Background

Hunt states that in 1960 he was assigned to the job of organizing a
\"government in exile\" for Cuba among Cuban exiles in Florida. The
plan adopted by the National Security Council under President Eisenhower
called for the formation and training of a brigade of Cuban exiles who
would invade Cuba, establish a provisional government, receive recog-
nition by the United States and overthrow the Castro government. The
brigade had its own air force and was otherwise fully equipped by the
United States Government. The operation, however, was not supposed
to be one involving United States Government participation. The venture
was to involve training and launching from outside the United States.

In connection with his political activity and the organization of the
government in exile, Hunt went to Mexico in 1960. Shortly thereafter
the Mexican government demanded that they leave and he returned to
the United States. Richard Nixon, then Vice President, was working
closely with the CIA on the project.

When President Kennedy was elected in November 1960, he was briefed
on the project and confirmed the plans, including the plan to provide air
cover to the invading Cuban force. In early 1961, however, the Kennedy
administration decided that the political organization of the Cuban
government in exile would have to be broadened so as to include all
elements of the Cuban society. Even radical leftwingers were to be
included. Hunt was assigned the job of convincing the leaders of the
Cuban community to accept such a broadening of the political structure
of the government in exile. Hunt found this to be an impossible job to
accomplish because the Cubans recruited to make up the invasion force
had been promised that the government in exile would be solidly anti-
Castro and anti-communist. Hunt asked to be relieved of his assignment
because he thought it was an impossible one to achieve and he returned
to Washington to work on propaganda and similar non-political aspects
of the forthcoming invasion.

Within twenty-four hours prior to the time that the Cuban brigade was
to hit the beaches at the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy made two
critical decisions that affected the final outcome: he cancelled plans

NW 78141
Docld:32201328 Page 3

SECRET/SENSITIVE

SECRET/SENSITIVE- 3

for an airstrike on Cuba which would have destroyed the six remaining
combat planes that were available to Castro; second, the order that
there be no air cover for the invading brigade. The result was that
the invading force was chopped up while it was still in the water; the
ships carrying the armored vehicles were sunk, as were the supply
ships, and the troops were left abandoned on the shore. The remnant
of the Cuban Air Force was entirely adequate to demolish the invasion
fleet.

Hunt concedes that he was bitter about the decisions made by President
Kennedy, but he primarily blames Arthur Schlesinger, Adlai Stevenson
and Robert Kennedy for advising the President to follow the course he
chose. He particularly feels that the Cubans had been recruited with
certain promises and that those promises were withdrawn at the last
minute. Hunt says, in fact, that the decision not to make the airstrike
and not to provide air cover was made after the invasion fleet had arrived
at the point of no return, i.e., when radio communication to the invasion
fleet had already terminated for security reasons.

After the Bay of Pigs disaster, Hunt worked with Allen Dulles until early
1962 at which time Dulles was replaced as DCI. In January 1962, Hunt

was assigned to the Domestic Operations Division of the Deputy Directorate
for Plans. He was involved in handling proprietaries based in the United
States, which have their impact abroad. His immediate superior was
Stanley Gaines, who was either Chief of Operations or Executive Officer
of the Domestic Operations Division and Tracy Barnes, who was Division
Chief of DOD (Barnes is a cousin by marriage to Vice President
Rockefeller.)

The proprietaries which Hunt was engaged in managing were Continental 24
Press which prepared news and radio broadcasts for foreign use;
24/Allied-Pacific Publishing Company of Bombay which was engaged in
publishing textbooks for Indian schools; the Rome Daily American
cover operation; and Fodor's Travel Guides, a proprietary which Hunt
questions as to whether it had any use. (Fodor's had been set up in
1946 as a cover operation but served no apparent use during the years
Hunt was with DOD.

NW 78141
Docld:32201328 Page 4
SECRET/SENSITIVE

SECRET/SENSITIVE- 4

The headquarters for the DOD was at 1717 H Street, N. W., in
Washington, D. C., and then later it was on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Hunt's assignment with DOD lasted until the spring of 1965.

During the period from January 1962 until 1965, he states that he never
traveled to Mexico or any other Latin American country. His first
trip to Mexico after 1961 was in 1970, when he traveled there for the
Mullen Company after his retirement from the CIA.

Hunt's Whereabouts on November 22, 1963

Hunt states that he had never been in Dallas until 1971, with a possible
exception of a change of planes on his way to Mexico with his family in
1960. He does not recall whether that change of planes took place in
Dallas or in Houston. In any event, he and his family never left the
airport on that occasion.

He has never had any contact, directly or indirectly, with Lee Harvey
Oswald, Jack Ruby or anyone else thought to have been associated with
the assassination of the President.

He was never in New Orleans in 1963 and has never had anything whatever
to do with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he identifies as a
communist organization.

During the period from January 1962 to 1965, he traveled once or twice
per year to India, two or three times per year to Paris, once or twice
per year to London, and, during that period, he traveled two or three
times to Rome. His only domestic travel in 1963 was between Washington
and New York. All travel, whether domestic or international, was in his
own name.

Hunt states that in 1961 he used the pseudonym of Edward J. Hamilton in
connection with his work on the Cuban project in Florida. With the
exception of that pseudonym and the pseudonym he used on the identifi-
cation papers provided him for the Ellsberg break in, he has never used
a pseudonym.

On November 22, 1963, he and his wife were driving on H Street at about
9th in Washington, D. C., when he turned the car radio on and learned
that the President had been shot. He and Mrs. Hunt had been shopping
in a Chinese grocery store in that immediate vicinity, immediately prior
to their getting into the car. The Hunts lived at 5215 Balton Road,
Sumner, Maryland. On their way home they drove to the Sidwell Friends
school on upper Wisconsin Avenue and picked up their younger daughter,
Kevan. Kevan told them that Robert and Courtenay Kennedy, children of
Attorney General Robert Kennedy, were students in the same school and
had been picked up by the Secret Service. The children in the school
knew that the President had been shot.

Mr. Hunt states that the following persons are witnesses to the fact that
he was here in Washington, D. C., at the time the President was shot
in Dallas:

1. His son, Howard St. John Hunt, then ten years of age.

2. His daughter, Lisa, then twelve years of age.

3. His daughter, Kevan, then eleven years of age.

4. The family maid, Mary Trayner, now employed by a family
living at 4806 DeRussey Parkway, Chevy Chase, Maryland,
and whose phone number is 652-2930.

Mr. Hunt believes that he was either taking the day off from work as
a part of annual leave on November 22, 1963, or he may have been
recuperating from a hospitalization for ulcers. He had been hospitalized
at about that period at Sibley Hospital in Washington, D. С.

Mr. Hunt states that he held the following oil company charge account
and credit cards in 1963 and that such accounts may provide corroboration
as to his presence in Washington, D. C., on November 22, 1963:
Esso Oil, Gulf Oil, Texaco Oil, Cities Service Oil, Brooks Brothers
(New York), Garfinkle's, Woodward and Lothrop, Sears Roebuck & Co.,
Hecht Co. He also states that telephone records might be checked with

NW 78141

SECRET/SENSITIVE-

SECRET/SENSITIVE

Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co.; that the CIA might have travel
voucher records showing his travel during that year and that CIA should
also have records on the dates on which he took sick leave or annual
leave.

Mr. Hunt categorically denies that he has been involved in any way what-
soever with the assassination of President Kennedy, Senator Robert
Kennedy, Martin Luther King, or any other person either within or without
the United States. He similarly denies any participation or involvement
whatever in the attempted assassination of Governor Wallace, the
disappearance of Congressman Hale Boggs or the shooting of Senator
Stennis.

He states that in connection with the planning for the Cuban invasion in
1961, he did suggest that Fidel Castro should be assassinated either before
or contemporaneously with that invasion, but his suggestion was not acted
upon or otherwise approved.

Attached are copies of a press statement made by Mr. Hunt in early
February 1975 in Florida, in which he denies the allegations made by
Dick Gregory and others with respect to his involvement in the assassi-
nation of President Kennedy and a letter written to Mr. Hunt by the former
family maid, Mary Traynor.

Lisa Hunt confirms her father's account that he was at home with the
family in the afternoon and evening of November 22, 1963. She recalls
that her father assembled the family in front of the television set. He
wanted them all to watch the program because it was an important
historical matter. They were all shocked about the assassination of
the President.

SECRET/SENSITIVE

The allegations made by Dick Gregory and others connecting
me to the murder of President John Kennedy are totally without foundati
They constitute a false and vicious libel.

These charges are bizarre products of sick minds.
The Political Left has never been able or willing to accept the fact
that Kennedy's assassin was a man of the Left; thus the Leftist
preoccupation with finding an alternate assassin.

Dick Gregory's smear represents the ultimate in slander and
innuendo customarily characterized as McCarthyism.

The Rockefeller and other investigative committees will
probably examine Gregory's charges as indeed they should. For my
part I would welcome a thorough high-level investigation and a full
airing of all relevant findings. Only if this takes place will I have
any hope of clearing my name and living free from the threats against
my life already made by neurotics.

I was not in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963; in fact I
never visited Dallas until eight years later. I did not meet Frank
Sturgis until 1972, nine years after we were allegedly together in
Dallas. I was not in Mexico in 1963, and I did not meet Lee Harvey
Oswald there or at any other place or time. Moreover, I shared the
nation's grief over the murder of our President. These are the facts.

Until authoritative investigative bodies make known their
judgment concerning my alleged involvement in the Kennedy murder I
will continue to bring libel actions against any and all parties
who repeat the libel. I must take this course because the libels are
prejudicial to my position before the Court now considering my
me is that
Appeal from the Watergate affair. And because the libels threaten my
only means of livelihood, as a writer. But of even greater concern to
continued publicity given to these reckless
charges could stimulate some yet-unpublicized maniac into violent
action against me and my family.

The minutes of the June 18, 1964, meeting (dated June 22, 1964).
contained the following: [OBTAIN COPY] (signed by Peter Jessup)
\"A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve
the underworld to assassinate certain Cuban leaders.
Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical of the reported plots and
stated that he would like to go into the matter further.
Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was
being put on notice and should do everything in its power to
ascertain promptly the veracity of the reports and then under-
take prevention. It was decided that Mr. Bundy would call the
matter to the Attorney General's attention as a matter of law
enforcement.\"

Mr. McCone's personal memorandum for the record on this
meeting (dated) June 18, 1964, contains substantially the same
information. [OBTAIN COPY] It refers to a June 10, 1964, CIA
memorandum \"reporting plans of Cuban exiles to assassinate
leading Cuban government leaders.\" This memo apparently had
been sent to Special Group members and the Attorney General.

\"ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms steps we

The official minutes of the July 30, 1964, 303 Committee

Subject: MONGOOSE MATERIALS RETAINED BY THE CIA

Joseph Selzer of the Inspector General staff made
available to me all the materials he has been able to assemble
from CIA sources concerning Project MONGOOSE. These consist
of three file folders and one loose-leaf binder. I have
examined them to determine if any reference is made to assassi-
nation, liquidation, or elimination of Castro.

The first document in this pile is a copy of the
minutes of the August 10, 1962, meeting of the special group
augmented, prepared by Tom Parrot. They were forwarded to
Dr. Chamberlain, the CIA Inspector General, by Robroy Ratliff,
a CIA employee detailed to the National Security Council. A
cover memo of April 18, 1975, was attached, may be of some
interest, and reads as follows:

\"FYI, We received a request from Belin
of the Vice President's Commission to
examine our files on MONGOOSE and other
Cuban and D.R. files. While this request
has not been resolved, the preliminary
response is not to allow this access.
Signed Robroy Ratliff.\"

The minutes of the August 10, 1962, meeting
contained no mention, implicit or explicit, of assassination.

The first complete file examined was a long green
cardboard file without a title on it. Inside, however, it is
indicated to be a record of Special Group meetings and

NW 78141

Special Group (Augmented) meetings at which General Carter
participated and discussions of Cuba and/or Cuban overflights
during the period August 15 to November 14, 1962. This file
contains a memorandum dated October 16, 1962, from General
Carter to the Special Group Augmented, Subject: \"Operation
MONGOOSE Sabotage Proposals.\" Paragraph 1c of this memorandum
contains a proposal that the CIA undertake undert grenade attack on
the Chinese Communist Embassy in Havana, to be carried out by
a recruited Cuban agent who has access to a roof overlooking
the (embassy) garden and who has volunteered for this mission.\"

The second file in this collection is entitled
simply \"MONGOOSE.\" This contains nothing relevant to the
assassination inquiry.

Next in this collection in a large manila
envelope on which is written in ink the following notation:
\"Separate cover attachment to ER75-5938.\" This envelope
contains miscellaneous papers related to MONGOOSE. The
documents in this envelope contain, among other things, a
long list of potential sabotage targets within Cuba. I found
no reference to assassination, either explicit or implicit.

The next file examined is marked \"Cuba Special
Subject.\" This file also contains miscellaneous papers
relating to Project MONGOOSE, none of which contain any
references to assassination.

The last item of this MONGOOSE package consists
of a bulky loose-leaf binder of papers assembled for General
Carter's reference of significant things that happened during
the period of August to October, 1962. In this notebook, the
Inspector General has already flagged entries which refer in
any way to Operation MONGOOSE. I have examined all such
entries.

Subject: PROJECT ZRRIFLE AND QJWIN

On April 25, 1975, I was given three file folders
containing material on the above subjects by Mr. Joseph Selzer
of the Inspector General's staff. According to Mr. Selzer, his
review of these files indicates that the basic purpose of
ZRRIFLE and its asset QJWIN was the burglarization of premises
outside the United States for the purpose of obtaining crypto-
logic materials. He assures me that there is nothing in these
files which refer explicitly or implicitly to assassination or
\"executive action\" in any form. His opinion is that clandes-
tine operatives of the type who wrote the documents contained
in these files would never commit to writing anything having
to do with the subject of assassination.

The first file reviewed is entitled \"ZRRIFLE/QJWIN/
RYBAT OPERATIONAL.\" The following entries in this file seem
to have some potential relevance:

1. Dispatch, dated November 1, 1960, to Chief of Station,
(Dakar), and Chief of Station, Luxembourg, from Chief, KUTUBE/D
at headquarters. This three-page dispatch apparently deals
with a mission on which a recruited agent, Jose Marie Andre
Mankel, will be sent from Luxembourg, where he was recruited,
to Dakar for the purpose of recruiting certain other agents
from among criminal elements there, specifically Corsicans.
The purpose for which these agents would ultimately be used
is not clear from this dispatch. However, paragraph 2a reads
as follows: \"In view of the extreme sensitivity of the

NW 78141

objective for which we want him to perform his task, he was
not told precisely what we want him to do. Instead, he was
told that we have evidence of Soviet operations among
nationality groups in Africa, specifically, Corsicans, and
that we would like to have him spot, assess, and recommend
some dependable, quick-witted persons for our use. (Comment:
It was thought best to withhold our true, specific require-
ments pending the final decision to use MANKEL.) He agreed
to go on the trip for us.\" It is not clear from this dispatch
that Chiefsof Station in Luxembourg and (Dakar) were completely
witting of the purpose for which Mankel is being sent to Dakar.
Paragraph 3 contains the following sentence: \"Rabney gave
Jouvenoy [Chief of Station, Luxembourg) the same briefing 12-10
concerning our purposes as he had given to the PCR CROSS, CCDakar).
The remainder of the dispatch deals with details of the con-
tacts with Americans which Mankel may make in Dakar if he
requires further assistance, including instruction for bringing
about a clandestine meeting.

2. Cable dated November 2, 1960, from (Frankfurt) to th
Director with the notation: \"Action: C/FI/D-4.\" This cab
contains the following statement in paragraph 1: \"Altman m
Mankel 2 November. He accepted offer to procede Leopoldvil
Precise mission not conveyed to him, he only informed that
mission might involve large element of personal risk.\"
2-10
3. Cable, dated November 23, 1960, from Director to
stations at Luxembourg and (Dakar). This cable contains the
first identification of Mankel with the code name QJWIN.
The cable reads as follows: \"AUDW 147 on QJWIN trip Dakar

contains the following code word references: RYBAT, LAURICLE,
ZRACORN.

4. Cable from Leopoldville to Director, with action
to C/FI/D4, dated 5 November 1960. It contains the following
paragraph:

\"Please inform Mankel he should proceed Leopoldville
as soon as shots completed. Not necessary have Congo visa.
Should go Paris and take Air France flight to Brazzaville
and can obtain visa for Brazzaville in Paris.\"

This cable contains a handwritten note in the margin as
follows: \"One copy given to Mr. Bissell by IS/Duty Off.
Saturday. Action to be taken by DDP. Ε.Β.\"

5. Cable, dated November 9, 1960, to Luxembourg from
Director. It contains the following statement: \"Unless yo
advised to contrary by Altman, brief QJWIN on Dakar mission,
using notes left during Rabney visit...Please insure he
thoroughly rehearsed all details since we anticipate he will
go from Leopoldville to Dakar with no opportunity reviewing
briefing...\"

6. Cable, November 11, 1960, to Director, from
Luxembourg. Paragraph 2 contains the following statement:
\"QJWIN recommended two French contacts who agree undertake
unspecified job. Arrangement made for direct access without
QJWIN if Altman interested...\"

7. Cable, dated November 12, 1960, to Director, from
Leopoldville. This cable requests the immediate departure
of QJWIN for Leopoldville, and contains the following state-
ment: \"Local operational circumstances require immediate
expediting of QJWIN travel to Leopoldville.\"

8. The file contains several documents apparently
describing various Italians in the area of Trieste who have
the capability to break and enter and crack safes. They
appeared to be of questionable morality. Reports on the safe-
crackers were transmitted in a dispatch from the Chief of
Station in (Rome) to the Chief, KUDOVE/D. The names of the 36
safecrackers in question are (Sabatti), (Cuccagna), and (Bernardini).

9. Cable, dated December 8, 1960, from Leopoldville to
the Director. It indicates that one purpose of QJWIN's
presence in Leopoldville is to recruit a major in the
\"Yugoslavian air force, through framing him up in an illegal
smuggling transaction. This recruitment is apparently for
the purpose of collecting information from within the

2 and all the top military commanders that used to come to the
3 Air Force Base. And remember that I had another job at the Air
4 Force Base training the military police. And I also was still
5 Chief of Security.
6 MR. OLSEN: Let me ask you, are you telling us that you
7 participated as a Cuban Air Force officer, and Chief of Training
8 military police and security and intelligence operations in the
9 Cuban Air Force, that participated in an attempt to assassinate
10 Castro?
11 MR. STURGIS: Yes, on two occasions, plus other
12 military officials.
13 MR. OLSEN: When did those attempts take place, during
14 the early part of 1959?
15 MR. STURGIS: Yes sir. I would say the first attempt
--
16 -- and I set it up as an exercise, that if I was to get the
17 green light which. I. did not anticipate that I would, because
--
18 there is such a thing as getting a green light and there is
--
19 another thing of doing something without the green light, in
20 other words, they do it but don't get caught but I did set it
--
21 up as an exercise, and I did have men on several occasions,
22 like I said, as a training exercise, stationed at the gate with
23 me there, with men stationed on the rooftops of the homes, my
--
24 excuse was for the protection of the entourage, Fidel and the
25 military commanders that he had with him, he had a hometown

1 bunch with him when they came to the Air Force, even with
2 General Bayo. And I felt that if I would get the nod to assas-
3 sinate them, I could do it within 30 seconds, high tail it and
4 everything.
5 MR. OLSEN: Was there something that you had drawn
6 up in the way of exercise as the result of the discussions with
7 the other Air Force officials?
8 MR. STURGIS: The Air Force and Army officials. This
9 information was given to the American Embassy. I again did
10 these exercises to try to get a diversion that if I would get
11 the nod to do the execution, that I would have some means of
12 diversionary tactics to draw attention away from the people who
13 did the execution, and that I was there with my people to prevent
14 it because of the security.
15 MR. OLSEN: Did you discuss these plans in advance with
16 Colonel Nichols?
17 MR. STURGIS: No sir. At the very I would say about
---
18. six weeks of the revolution was over with there was a great deal
19 of discontent among many of the top ranking military officers.
20 I knew these people personally, I was in with them at those
21 meetings and various places, and that they discussed, we all
22 discussed the assassination then. And some said, well, there
23 are some officers that will be with the group, Fidel and Raoul
24 and Che, that were not really with them. So they were split
25 on the idea of assassinating them. So they asked my opinion.

3 to do it is at the front gate when he approaches, and to just,
4 : if there is seven or eight jeeps, just to give everyone in all
5 of the seven or eight jeeps, whether they are pro or anti if

7 hurt.
8 MR. OLSEN: I didn't understand whehter you answered
9 my question as to whether or not you had discussed in advance
10 with Colonel Nichols.
11 MR. STURGIS: No sir, after the meeting with the
12 different military commanders, I reported to Nichols the type
13 of discussions that were made at those meetings.
14 MR. OLSEN: And what was Colonel Nichol's response?
15 5 MR. STURGIS: Can we go off the record?

20 MR. OLSEN: And did you then stand by and stall?
21 MR. STURGIS: Yes sir, I not only stood by, but then
22 I proceeded to do these exercises without asking Colonel Nichols,
23 I did those on my own, to prepare a special group of men to set
24 this up.
NW 781412 MR. OLSEN: You prepared the exercise. Did you ever

4 only thing that held them back was me, I am the only one that
5 held them back, because they wanted to kill him in a minute.
6 MR. OLSEN: And so they ere urging that this be done,
7 but you were holding back on it?
8 MR. STURGIS: Right.
9 MR. OLSEN: And were you holding back on it at least

15 in these exercises.
16 MR. OLSEN: So that there was some planning, but no
17 attempt?
18 MR. STURGIS: Well, let me say this. We are on a very
19 20 thin piece of string there, because I was several times making
21 those exercises, and I was really, because of my high position
22 must understand that I did break into the headquarters of the
23 24 Cuban Army at Columbia Barracks, and did steal documents out of
there. And I also at my own headquarters, in my files, I did

7 8 a distinction, if I can, between some plans for, some setting up
9 might be with them. I am trying to distinguish that kind of

6 would provide the information for the Embassy?
7 MR. STURGIS: To provide agents for the American
8 Embassy.
9 MR. ROETHE: You were not recruiting them especially
10 for assassination attempt?...
11 MR. STURGIS: No. Now, Camelo gave me enough informa-
12 tion that night where I brok into the Chief of the Army head-
1 13 quarters he was Chief of the Army. I broke into their files,
--
14 and I did photograph and steal documents.
15 MR. OLSEN: What did you do with those documents?
16 MR. STURGIS: I turned them over to the others.
17 MR. OLSEN: To Colonel Nichols?
18 MR. STURGIS: Yes.
19 MR. ROETHE: Were you operating here now for Colonel
20 Nichols, or do you know if you were operating for CIA? Who was
21 the creator of this policy, if you know, Colonel Nichols as a
22 diplomat? Was he a diplomat at that time?
23 MR. STURGIS: Colonel Nichols was the American Military
24 Air Attache, which could be a cover for the CIA.
On MR. OLSEN: You don't know if he was CIA or not?

3 MR. OLSEN: Let me turn here, Frank, to this area.
4 5 Were you ever by Colonel Nichols requested to organize any
6 American Embassy, were you ever asked to carry out any kind of
7 activity in Cuba?
8 MR. STURGIS: No sir.
9 MR. OLSEN: You were never asked to carry out any
10 assassination?
11 MR. STURGIS: No sir.
12 MR. OLSEN: Were you ever asked to carry out any
13 attempt to overthrow the Castro Government?
14 MR. STURGIS: Well, let's not say overthrow the
15 Castro Government. Colonel Nichols was very much, in his
16 thinking, in the discussions with him, against the Castro
17 Government. But then here you have a man that goes by the book.
18 MR. OLSEN: Let me ask you this. Were you ever asked
19 to carry out any, action in Cuba on behalf of the American
20 Embassy?
21 MR. STURGIS: No sir.
22 MR. OLSEN: Or Colonel Nichols?
23 MR. STURGIS: No sir.

13 MR. STURGIS: No sir. I took some documents here that
14 beloned to Commander Ricardo Lorie in his preparation to leave
15 Cuba and come to exile. I helped to arrange for the escape
16 of the Chief of the Air Force and his wife. As a matter of fact,

4 MR. STURGIS: In order for me to get very close with
5 Fidel personally, I went through a great risk in buying guns
6 and equipment and smuggling guns and equipment to Cuba, both
7 by air, by automobiles, and in Key West by the ferry. And I had
8 an elaborate system made up.
9 MR. OLSEN: Let's go into that just a little bit. We
10 are going back into the revoluntionary period, before the
11 revolution succeeded, while you were working for Castro, while
12 he was up in the hills. Who did you buy guns from in the US?
13 MR. STURGIS: I bought guns in Alexandria, Virginia.

15 ARMCO.

SUBJECT: Review of Personal Papers of Mr. Dulles

I reviewed the personal papers of Mr. Dulles covering
the period after his departure from the Agency and while he
was a member of the Warren Commission. I also reviewed Agency
historical documents relating to Cuba. The review did not
turn up anything of special significance or importance. For
the most part, Mr. Dulles' papers included correspondence
dealing with his book, personal contacts, and social activities.
I have attached copies of all material in his papers that in
any way dealt with the Kennedy assassination or the work of
the Warren Commission. I have also attached relevant
individual items culled from his daily diary.

opportunity to see you during my

any way that I might during your
service on the Commission of Investigator
of the Presidents assassination.
The labors of this commission will
be most vital and can contribute

the political and social fabric of

It was my feeling that perhaps I
would help you again as I used to in

intelligent and informed big man, - a
coordinator, a gatherer of information - in

of water.\" As you know I have handled

all branches of the government - the

Of most importance I have a
personal angle. Mr. Kennedy was
friend and classmate. I would
like to contribute to a dignified
assessment of the whys and to the
definitive conclusions which would
lay a basis for favorable socio-political
awakening:

The Commission, I presume a
commissioned, would work through existing
agencies. It must however quite the
reporting from those agencies and, at
times, suggest further lines of
investigation. In this area I could
also be of help.

At present I am awaiting the
start of the next school year when
I shall resume my pre CIA
services as a Professor of Economics
and I am available if you should
need my services.

manifold implications for the future.
I wish you well.

Sincerely.

Annex to Noven r 29, 1963, Diary:

About 5:30 on Friday, November 29, while I was
sitting around the fire after a game of golf at Lloyd
Neck, the telephone rang and I was advised that the
President wanted to speak with me. I went to the phone
and the White House operator said that the President
wanted to speak with me, that he was on another line,
and would I hold on for a minute. After a short wait
the operator told me that someone had gone into the
room and that she would call me back.

She called me back in five minutes. This gave
me a brief chance to puzzle out what it was the President
wanted to say to me. As it turned out, aided by some
news items that the President was considering appointing
a high-level commission to look into all the circumstances
of the assassination of the President, I was led to put this
as the first possibility. Soon the call came through. The
President was on the line. I told him how much my thoughts
had been with him in recent days. He thanked me. Then
in a very kind expression of appreciation for what he
thought I had done for the country over the years, he said
he wished me to do a job for him. I asked him what it was.
He said he was appointing a commission to look into all
the circumstances surrounding the assassination and the later
killing of the man believed responsible for the assassination.
This commission would include the Chief Justice, members of
the House and Senate from both parties, and two men outside
of government, including myself, if I would serve.

I told the President without hesitation that I was
prepared to serve if he felt I could be of service to him
and the nation. I said that I assumed that he had considered
my recent job and that he did not consider that this service
was in any way an impediment. He said he had carefully
considered it and he felt that, on the contrary, it would
be helpful. I said I assumed that what he had told me was
entirely confidential. He said it was until it was announced
and he did not know the exact hour of that. I said I would,
of course, maintain the confidence.

Please see enclosed letter from (Jose Colon)
Over the phone he told me that he had some infor-
mation, rather vague, about some plot of air force
officers to \"impeach\" President Kennedy, including
an Air Force officer who had been attache in
Czechoslovakia. I told him that such information
should be brought to the attention of the FBI. He
promised to do it but whether he will or not, I do
not know.

I can only judge by telephone conversation
in that he talked quite sanely but very vaguely.

Memorandum for: The Honorable Lee Rankin
:
Attached are a few items of possible interest:

(1) a copy of an article in the January 1964
British \"Labour Monthly\" by, I believe, R. P. Dutt. I
understand he is the editor of the \"Labour Monthly\" and a
British Communist. I am seeking further data with regard
to Dutt. I call your attention particularly to the section
beginning on page 13, entitled \"A C.I.A. Job?\". I suggest
that you might wish the CIA to send to you directly all
important items of this general nature and also items
bearing on the future Communist propaganda treatment of
the assassination issue with their estimate, preferably
coordinated with the State Department, showing the general
trend of such propaganda, if there is one. It has been
my experience that the Communist party of the Soviet Union
exercises a good deal, but not complete, control over the
propaganda activities of the various Communist parties
in the free world and often uses these parties or selected
ones to launch various trial balloons in the propaganda
field.
:
(2) a letter I obtained from a source I will
indicate to you orally written by George de Mohrenschildt,
who you may recall appears in the Commission's records as
one of the men who had contact with, and as I recall, some
influence over Oswald. You will recall that the State
Department had interrogated him briefly. I believe, at the
insistence of the FBI. This letter might furnish a desirable
basis for some further interrogation as I did not find the
State Department interrogation wholly satisfactory.

on stationery of the Senate Judiciary Committee and
makes certain allegations bearing on the Commission's
work. I do not know the writer and I have merely
acknowledged the letter and stated I was referring
it to the Commission. It may require no further answer.

I have.
Here are one or two additional thoughts

(a) that we study the use made of post office
boxes in connection with Oswald's activities and crimes
and also ascertain the terms and conditions under which
post office boxes can be rented, and whether there are
uniform regulations or whether it is left more or less
to the whim of local postmasters. Oswald's ability to
hire a post office in a fictitious name and to use it for
the receipt of firearms seems to have facilitated his criminal
activities. Later the Commission might possibly wish to
make some suggestions on this subject.

(b) I should be glad to see the conclusions of
the recent report outlined a few days ago in The New York
Times giving arguments for the shifting of the Narcotics
Bureau from the Treasury Department.

(c) Do we have an adequate study by the State
Department of their policy, of any legislation affecting
it, with regard to the terms and conditions of the registra-
tion of undesirables? I assume that an American citizen
who has not forfeited his rights as such las an undeniable
right to return to the United States, but I am not clear
whether this is under law or merely established practice.

(d) Do we have any recent study available as
to the extent to which, under the Constitution, the rights
of citizens (or residents?) to acquire and retain firearms
apart from the question of legislation with regard to the
bearing of concealed arms?

DUIT, Rajani Palme

Dutt was born in 1896 at Cambridge, England.
His father, a doctor in Cambridge, belonged to a prominent.
Bengali family. His mother was Swedish. Was educated
at Perse School in Cambridge, Balliol Oxford. He became
a charter member of the British Communist party in 1920.
Has been the British Communist party's leading theoretician
since then.
:
He founded the \"Labour Monthly\" in 1921 and
has been editor since then. Has taken an active interest
in Indian Communist party affairs and was Secretary-
Chairman of the British Communist party for a period in
1939. He also served for a time in the Communist party
of Great Britain politburo. His standing with Moscow is
excellent. In 1962 was afforded an honorary doctorate
of history at Moscow University, where he lectured in
April and May 1962. These lectures were published by
Lawrence and Wishart in London 1963 under the title of
*Problems of Contemporary History\". One part of his
lecture dealt with the cold war. The main theme of this
section was to establish that the responsibility for the
origins of the cold war rested with the West and tha the
West merely continued the policies of the Nazis and the
Fascists.

Dutt's current position has been described as
head of the international department of the Communist
party of Great Britain, an office which he has held since
at least 1956. He is also vice-chairman of the Communist
party of Great Britain and again a member of the political
and national executive committee.

Memorandum for
The Honorable Lee Rankin

From
A. W. Dulles

I read with great interest the papers attached
to the agenda for the Commission's meeting February 24,
1964. In J. Edgar Hoover's letter to you of February 10,
1964, on page 2, last paragraph, there is reference to
Mr. Robert Storey's statement to Mr. Wade that when he,
Storey, was with the War Crimes Commission in Germany after
World War II, he ascertained that \"the Central Intelligence
Agency had informants that no one knew about, except the
Central Intelligence Agency agent, and that the informant
might have been an informant\".

While this statement is not very clear, I would
point out that the Central Intelligence Agency was not
organized until late 1947 under the National Security
Act of that year and that the Agency Mr. Storey is presum-
ably referring to, if he did make the statement, must be
the Office of Strategic Services, which was dissolved in
late 1945. Of course, during the period of existence of
the OSS, Lee Harvey Oswald was an infant.

With respect to J. Edgar Hoover's letters to you
of February 11 and 13, 1964, I suggest that it may be
desirable to try to clear up the confusion as to the existence
of the \"law enforcement officer in Dallas\" who allegedly
claimed that L. H. Oswald had been contacted by the FBI
to become an informant. As I read the record avaiàable to
me, there seems to be some conflict in the testimony of
newsmen Huckins and Golden. Very possibly this has arisen
from the three contacts the FBI had with Oswald on June 26,
and August 10 and 16, 1962. I dá not find in the affidavits
any indication of the purpose of either the June 26 or
August 16 visits. The August 10 visit apparently related
to the New Orleans Fair Play for Cuba incident. Have' we
memoranda on these visits to Lee Harvey Oswald?

I have spoken to Mr. McCone and
Mr. Helms about the general subject matter
of your memorandum of March 17, 1964, regarding
Lee H. Oswald and the charge that he was a
paid informant of the FBI, CIA or another
Federal agency.

Mr. McCone is away from Washington

that the first procedure suggested by you be
followed; namely, an appropriate affidavit.. I
understand that this is now being prepared and

MEMORANDUM FOR THE HONORABLE LEE RANKIN

FROM A. W. DULLES

Last evening Attorney General Carr dined
with Jack McCloy and me and had one or two
suggestions:

1. that the Commission might wish to
interview (a) Mr. and Mrs. Earl Cabell. They were
in a strategic position in the automobile proces-
sion at the time of the assassination. We saw them
briefly when we visited Dallas. (b) Lewis Nichols,
former President of the Dallas Bar Association,
who called on Oswald in connection with the question
of his being legally represented. Carr seems to
think that he has some interesting information
that has not been obtained. (c) Elgin Crull, City
Manager of Dallas, who, as such, was in direct over-
all command of the police.

2. Carr also mentioned a black notebook
belonging to Oswald which had two Washington
telephone numbers: (a) the Russian Embassy and
(b) a telephone number with no rame but which was
called by the Dallas police.. The person answering
was apparently a Negro pastor here.

Memorandum for Lee Rankin

From A. W. Dulles
July 27, 1964

As a result of my weekend reading which I
have returned with comments, I have the following
comments in addition to comments noted on the
material returned.

1. Where have we dealt with the evidence
as to Oswald's ability to handle a rifle?

2. Where do you plan to discuss Oswald's
escape pattern or plans; did he have any - if so,
why did he leave $170 at the Paines and start out
with less than $207 If he killed the President to
make a name, gain notoriety, etc., why did he try to
escape at all and then deny the shooting whén caught?
I feel we must deal with these difficult issues. I
have some speculations on the subject.

3. If Marina had admitted that she had once
been a member of the Komsomol, would that have changed
the decision regarding her visa? I believe this has
been considered by the State Department. I feel we
should look into this.

4. A great deal of the description of the
motorcade and the shooting will be unclear unless we
have a street map and, if possible, a photo taken
from the sixth floor window. Is this possible?

Memorandum by Paul Hoch Concerning
CIA Activities and the Warren Commission Investigation

Mr. Paul Hoch, a long-time critic of the Warren Commission
report, has been associated with Ramparts magazine, NBC news,
and US News and World Report in the past. He has been in touch
with CIA on the Warren Commission investigation since at least
1971. Our files show that Mr. Hoch was one of 12 people who,
in 1967 or earlier, received a copy of the original unexpurgated
list of all Warren Commission material held by the National
Archives before a new list without CIA titles was prepared by
Archives at our request.

In the introduction to his copyrighted 24 March 1975 memo-
randum (Tab 1), Mr. Hoch notes that he \"concentrates on the
CIA, with emphasis on specific questions relevant to domestic
CIA activities, possible CIA nondisclosure to the Warren Com-
mission, and possible links between the assassination and CIA
attempts to kill Fidel Castro.\" A review of the memorandum
reveals that it contains a number of questions and allegations
concerning CIA. However, it also contains questions and
allegations concerning the FBI, the Department of State, and
various military departments. It appears to be a general
criticism of Warren Commission methods and findings with
particular emphasis on CIA's alleged role in obfuscating what
Mr. Hoch believes to be the true nature of its own activities
leading up to and following the assassination.

We are not competent to comment on Mr. Hoch's questions
or allegations concerning other Government agencies or the
Commission. He has raised a number of points concerning CIA
that we address below. Before doing so, however, a few words
are in order concerning the set of mind with which Mr. Hoch
seems to have approached this matter.

On page 11 of his memorandum, Mr. Hoch quotes Mr. James
Angleton as having made the following remark to Mr. Seymour
Hersh when asked by the latter about alleged CIA wrong-doing
and domestic activities: \"A mansion has many rooms and there
were many things going on during the period of the [anti-war]
bombings. I'm not privy to who struck John.\" Mr. Hoch then
expresses puzzlement over this latter statement. He notes that
\"who struck John\" may be a literary allusion or cliche unfamiliar
to him and goes on to say:

It may have been a reference to some other John-- :
e.g., Mitchell. Also, it is conceivable that \"Who
struck John\" was some sort of code name for the CIA
study of the Kennedy assassination. Angleton should be
asked to explain that statement, and whether he is aware
of any CIA investigations of Oswald or the assassination,
particularly any which may have reached conclusions dif-
ferent from the Warren Commission's. Regardless of what
Angleton now says he meant by his comment, an intended
reference to John Kennedy seems as likely as any other
explanation.

:

Mr. Hoch's willingness to attribute sinister implications to
such a common phrase is both humorous and revealing. It
belies the impression of reasonably objective scholarship he
has sought to project in his memorandum.

The following questions are paraphrases of points con-
cerning CIA raised by Mr. Hoch. They are keyed to the page on
which the substance with which they deal appears in his memo-
randum.

QUESTIONS
(
Did CIA intercept a letter and money order which Oswald's
mother sent to him shortly after he defected to Russia?

Answer:
No. CIA did not intercept a letter and money order sent to
Oswald by his mother shortly after his defection. Mr. Hoch's
question probably refers to a matter taken up by Mrs.
Marguerite Oswald with the FBI on 28 April 1960 and described
in the 12 May 1960 report by the Dallas FBI office in Tab 2 .

What dissemination in CIA was made of the FBI report \"Fair Play
for Cuba Committee--New Orleans Division\" which dealt only with
Oswald and \"A. J. Hidell,\" Oswald's alias? Other than this
report, were any CIA employees or informants aware of Oswald's
activities in New Orleans?

Answer:
A copy of this report is attached at Tab 3. It was transmitted
to CIA by the FBI under a cover note dated 8 November 1963. The
date stamp on the reverse of the cover sheet indicates it was
logged in to the Agency on 12 November 1963. The DDP Counter-
intelligence Staff liaison office received it on 15 November
1963. The report then went to the counterintelligence office
of the DDP Special Activities Staff which was then concerned with
Cuban matters (no date indicated). The registry for the Special
Activities Staff counterintelligence office handled the report
on 21 November 1963. On 22 November 1963, the report was
received by the DDP Counterintelligence Staff special investi-
gations office, presumably because it concerned a former defector
to the Soviet Union. Apparently it was being processed by that
office when President Kennedy was assassinated. Prior to the
assassination, CIA had no information concerning Oswald's
activities in New Orleans beyond this report.

544 Camp Street: Is there a CIA connection with Guy Banister?
With David Ferrie? With other associates of Banister?

Answer:
According to CIA records, during 1960 Guy Banister operated a
private detective agency in New Orleans called Banister and
Associates. CIA considered contacting him for use as a foreign
intelligence source and for possible use of his firm for cover
purposes. However, security investigation revealed derogatory
information about his professional conduct, and he was not
contacted. With regard to Mr. Ferrie, Agency files indicate that
CIA never considered contacting him for any purpose at any time.
Our record search to date has not revealed any contacts with
other associates of Guy Banister.

Was Oswald ever a CIA informant? Was he debriefed by CIA in
Moscow? on his return from the USSR? If not, any particular
reason? Did CIA ever receive in whole or in part Oswald's
manuscript about his life in Russia? Is #110669 an identifying
number used by CIA in any way?

Answer:
Lee Harvey Oswald was never associated or connected, directly
or indirectly, in any way whatsoever with CIA (see Tab 4 for
testimony of John A. McCone and Richard Helms before Warren Com-
mission and Affidavit of John A. McCone). As a former marine
and as a returned defector, he was of primary interest to
:
military authorities and to the FBI who were responsible for any
debriefings of him upon his return from the USSR. CIA received
copies of Oswald's manuscript from the FBI and the Warren Com-、
mission in the material disseminated by them after the
assassination. The number 110669 is not a CIA identification
number of Lee Harvey Oswald for any purpose including registration
as a source. Within CIA records, the number 110669 identifies
an individual of Austrian birth who was of intelligence interest
in East Asia during the 1940's. The Inter-Agency Source

Answer:
We have had previous communications with Mr. Hoch concerning
this matter (see Tab 5).
The Agency at no time in its dealings with the FBI in the
Field or with the Warren Commission in Headquarters described
or suggested that the unknown individual whose photograph was
taken in Mexico City on 1 October was Lee Harvey OSWALD. Our
total coverage of the unknown individual numbers twelve photo-
graphs taken on 1 October (USSR Embassy), 4 October (USSR
Embassy) and 15 October (Cuban Embassy). OSWALD left Mexico
City, it is known, at 0830 hours, 2 October. It is clear,
Mr.
:
therefore, that this individual could not be OSWALD.
Helms, in a memorandum to the Warren Commission Chief Counsel,.
indicated very clearly that the photograph of this unknown
individual had nothing to do with the OSWALD case. In the
light of all of the facts in the file, we find no reason to
:
modify this judgment.

Mexican intercept operations: Did CIA have recordings of calls
between Cuban and Soviet Embassies in which Oswald is discussed
or in which Oswald participated? Did we have a recording of
Oswald's conversation with a guard at the Soviet Embassy?

Answer:
CIA has transcripts of such calls, including a conversation
between Oswald and a guard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City, which were made on 27 and 28 September and 1 October
1963. These transcripts were reviewed in their entirety by
the Warren Commission at CIA Headquarters and in Mexico City
at the Station in April 1964. The recordings were erased
routinely after the transcripts were made. Oswald identified
himself only in the course of the 1 October conversation, and
a summary of that conversation was the first indication of his、
presence in Mexico reported by the Station on 8 October 1963
and disseminated by CIA Headquarters on 10 October 1963.

Who had substantial knowledge of matters pertaining to Oswald
in the CIA Station in Mexico City at the time of Oswald's
visit there? Was E. Howard Hunt the acting chief of station
in Mexico City at or near that time?

Answer:
The operations which produced the transcripts of the calls con-
nected with Oswald on 27 and 28 September and 1 October 1963
were quite closely held at the station.
:
Few people beyond the
chief and his deputy, one or two senior officers, and the
monitor would have been privy to the material.

E. Howard Hunt served in Mexico City from December 1950 to June
1951. From November 1960 until his retirement in 1970, he was
assigned to Headquarters. During the period in which Mr. Hunt
was alleged by Mr. Hoch to have been acting chief of station in
Mexico City--August-September 1963--Mr. Hunt was assigned to a
DDP desk at Headquarters. See Tab 6 for documents covering Mr.
Hunt's activities then. (Mr. Hunt made one extended trip to
Europe during this period, from July 1965 to September 1966.)

Did CIA personnel play any role in building up, disseminating,
then denigrating a report that Oswald had received money to kill
Kennedy from someone at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City? Was
there a CIA connection with Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte, the source
of the story?

Answer:
As stated in information provided to the Warren Commission by the
Agency, CIA had no connection with activities or statements by
Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte concerning allegations that Oswald
:,
received money to kill President Kennedy from someone at the
Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. After Gilberto Alvarado came to
the American Embassy in Mexico City on 26 November 1963 and made
his allegations, his story was investigated by local CIA and
FBI representatives in liaison with responsible Mexican law
enforcement authorities. The Agency representatives informed the
FBI that Alvarado was a well known Nicaraguan Communist under-
ground member who was an informant of a Nicaraguan Security
a CIA source. On November
Service officer who was, in turn,
30, 1963, Alvarado admitted to Mexican security officials in
writing that his whole story of having seen Lee Oswald receive
money in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City to assassinate
President Kennedy was false. On the same day, CIA reported to
appropriate U. S. Government authorities that Alvarado stated

with the Oswald case prior to the assassination is recorded in
his 1 May 1964 memorandum to the Acting Chief, Contact
Division, attached at Tab 8 (a typed version of the document
is also attached because of the poor legibility of the
original). He may have been involved in the Agency's effort to
support the Warren Commission during the Commission's investi-
gations. Mr. Moore has stated that he was never asked by Mr.
de Mohrenschildt for advice concerning Oswald. We find no
indication that there was ever any contact between Oswald and
Mr. Moore.

What actions did CIA take in Dallas or in Washington after
Kennedy was shot or after Oswald was arrested?

Answer:
A special cable channel was established at headquarters to
insure that all correspondence concerning Oswald would be con-
trolled in a central repository. The resultant correspondence
was subsequently incorporated into the Oswald file which was
reviewed in full by the Warren Commission. Extensive investi-
gative and analysis work was performed by the Agency in coordi-
nation with other Government agencies and with the Warren Com-
mission.

Following the assassination of President Kennedy, DCI McCone
instructed the Domestic Contact Service (DCS) to send an
officer from its Dallas office to Parkland Hospital to contact
and offer assistance to the FBI and Secret Service. Mr. Linwood'
Davis of that office went immediately to the hospital where he
identified himself to the FBI and offered his services during
the emergency. To date, our file review shows no indication
that any particular use was made of Mr. Davis at that time.

Does CIA have files with references to Oswald or his family
other than CD692?

Answer:
CIA had only one general file on Oswald at the time of the
assassination. That file had been opened as a result of
Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union. At the time of the
assassination the Warren Commission reviewed and received a
copy of that file in its entirety. As the Agency continued
to cooperate with the Commission, the Oswald file grew. It
numbers 58 volumes now and contains all information in
possession of the Agency on Oswald or his family.

The single exception to the above statement concerns one
HTLINGUAL document dated 8 July 1961 but discovered only on
review triggered by press publicity following the Oswalds'
return to the U. S. in June 1962. The sensitivity of this
intelligence precluded its inclusion in the Oswald file in
general circulation. However, a copy of the document was
forwarded to the FBI immediately upon discovery. (Also see
question concerning Marina Oswald keyed to p. 14 of Mr. Hoch's
memorandum.)

Was there any FBI-CIA liaison concerning Oswald's intention
to attend Albert Schweitzer College in Switzerland? Was
there any CIA intelligence interest in the school during that
period?

Answer:
Information concerning Oswald's intention to attend Albert
Schweitzer College in Switzerland was passed to CIA by the
FBI in the report of the FBI's interview with Mrs. Marguerite
C. Oswald on 28 April 1960 (see pp 5-6of that report in Tab 2).
A search of CIA files has revealed no CIA knowledge of an
Albert Schweitzer College in Switzerland.

Has CIA had any contact with Marina Oswald and are there any
CIA records on her not previously turned over to the Warren
Commission.

Answer:
CIA has had no contact with Marina Oswald. Our records show
that a complete set of HTLINGUAL documents on Marina were
turned over by hand to Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI on
23 November 1963 for use by the FBI in the course of their
investigations. One other HTLINGUAL document received after
that date was passed to the FBI in September 1964. To date,
we have found no record indicating that CIA also passed these
documents to the Warren Commission; nor do we have any record
of how they were used by the FBI during the Warren Commission
investigations.

Answer:
The unidentified man who accompanied Mr. Helms to the 12 March
1964 meeting was Mr. David E. Murphy, then Chief of the Soviet
Russia Division, DDP. See paragraph 6 of the Tab 9 memorandum
of record of this meeting for Mr. Helms' reported remark that
he and Mr. Murphy were the two Clandestine Services officers

Has CIA pursued independent investigations of the assassination
and developed any new information not already provided to the
Warren Commission, the Justice Department, or other responsible
authority? For example, what use did the Agency make of the
Zapruder film?

Answer:
As noted by Mr. Helms in the course of his testimony before the
Warren Commission (see Tab 4, pp 123-124), the case of Lee Harvey
Oswald and the assassination of President Kennedy is not closed
and \"will never be closed\" as far as the Agency is concerned.

independently by the Agency has been shared with appropriate
authorities, in particular the FBI.

Has CIA engaged in any activities regarding critics of the

them?

Answer:
Tab 11 contains a copy of Book Dispatch 5847 which transmitted
guidance to certain CIA stations and bases concerning the
countering of criticism of the Warren Report. This guidance
for the field was prepared in response to a rash of books
and articles criticizing the Commission's findings. It was
sent out in April 1967. Our investigations to date have
turned up no other guidance or activities undertaken in this
connection.

Did CIA have a connection with any member of the Odio family,
including knowledge of an abortive plot to kill Castro which
resulted in the imprisonment of Sylvia Odio's parents? Does
CIA have any knowledge of the identities and activities of
three men who reportedly visited Sylvia Odio two months prior
to the assassination of President Kennedy, particularly the
man introduced to her as Leon Oswald?

Answer:
The only relationship between CIA and the Odio family was the
debriefing of Cesar Humberto Odio del Toro, Sylvia Odio's
brother, during the early 1960's on a routine basis as part of
a general program of eliciting positive intelligence from Cuban
refugees in the United States. There is no connection or
relationship between the Agency and the imprisonment of
Sylvia Odio's parents for involvement in anti-Castro activities.
According to our records, Sylvia Odio's parents were not
imprisoned because of involvement in an assassination attempt
against Castro. The following background information concerning
the circumstances surrounding their imprisonment was provided
by Cesar del Toro. The parents of Cesar and Sylvia were arrested
by the Cuban Government in 1961 and sentenced to thirty years
and nine years in prison respectively. They were imprisoned for
participation in an organization named the Movimiento
Revolucionario del Pueblo. Amador Odio Padron had been obtaining
food and medical provisions for the care of Cubans in asylum at

various foreign embassies in Havana.
His wife had been
helping him in that activity. Prior to his arrest Amador Odio
Padron had been the owner of Cuba's largest inter-provincial
trailer truck concern. (In fact, our records indicate that
he had used his trucking concern to smuggle arms to anti-
Battista forces during the 1954-56 period.) During the mid-
1960's, Cesar Odio made several attempts to secure the release
of his parents by offering to purchase large quantities of
spare parts and transport them to Cuba.

The identities of the three men who reportedly visited Sylvia
Odio two months prior to the assassination of President Kennedy
were established in the course of the Warren Commission
investigation. (See Report of The President's Commission on
the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, U. S. Government

Subject has performed in a manner quite consistent with his long and broad ex-
perience in many aspects of the craft of intelligence, His senior grade, his special
expertise in the field of propaganda and publication and his very high intellect
have contributed to the division's operations in the public media field a sharp
focus, an economical concentration of money and effort and a consequently
heightened impact. In the WUHUSTLER project, Subject vindicated his faith in
a moribund clandestine asset by demonstrating, after about a year and a half under
his personal direction, that it is one of the most effective activities of its kind.
Before Subject assumed direct responsibility for this project, it had suffered from
visionary and diffuse direction and from poor case officer-agent rapport. Subject's
personal handling of this operation is marked by excellent rapport and the project
prospers on an entirely reoriented basis which the agent himself enthusiastically
welcomes.

Subject's supervisory responsibility has extended over two secretaries, from one
to two professional staffers under official cover and three professional career
employees under unofficial cover. The fairness and precision of his management
has patently won their respect and inspired their performance.

he promptly and swiftly terminated a large and effective radio broadcast-

immediately upon belated discovery that insuperable, practical obstacles
precluded realization of the project's theoretical potential.

Subject's professional background has attuned his constant attention to
FI operational opportunities arising in the course of his current CA

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with the Warren Commission on 12 March 1964

1. On 12 March 1964, Mr. Helms, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Rocca
met with Mr. Rankin, Chief Counsel for the Warren Commission, Mr.
Willems, and other members of Mr. Rankin's staff. The purpose of
this meeting was to discuss the current status of the CIA contribution
to the work of the Warren Commission.

2. The first topic raised by Mr. Rankin concerned information
on Lee Harvey Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union as reported by the FBI,
based on their interview of the defector, This
discussion is reported in a separate memorandum.

3. After disposing of the question of information on
Oswald, Mr. Rankin's staff showed us a detailed memorandum they had
prepared based on all of the information available to them, including
our own contribution concerning Oswald's stay in the USSR. This ma-
terial, together with some questions specifically related to the material
we provided, will be forwarded to us by Mr. Rankin's staff. It was then.
suggested that a CIA officer most familiar with the material provided
by CIA on the USSR aspects of the Oswald case visit the Commission in
order to review on the spot the testimony given to the Commission by
Marina Oswald. We agreed to send the appropriate officer to review
this testimony but suggested that we wait until after receipt of the ma-
terial just shown to us.

4. Members of Mr. Rankin's staff then spoke about having found
a book in Oswald's possessions which had certain letters cut out giving
the impression that this might have formed the base or key for a cipher
system. They asked whether it would be useful in our opinion to send
this book to NSA for review. We assured them that NSA was the appro-
priate Agency for this and Mr. Rocca commented that when this was
done reference might also be made to the portion of Lee Oswald's notes
which mentioned microdot. Another member of the Rankin staff

(
commented on the fact that Oswald had obtained employment in this
country in a photographic firm through a Russian friend. He thought
this might have a possible bearing on any clandestine communications
systems he might have received from the Soviets.

5. Members of Mr. Rankin's staff then commented on the testi-
mony of Mrs. Oswald to the effect that the letters from her son regard-
ing his desire to return to the United States had the appearance of being
dictated since they contained none of his usual grammatical errors and
used legal language with which he would not have been familiar. In this
connection, the fact that Lee Oswald wrote to the Embassy requesting
help in arranging his return to the U.S. soon after receipt by the Embassy
of a telegram from the Department reporting on correspondence with
Oswald's mother seemed to indicate to members of Mr. Rankin's staff
that the Soviets might have had access in some fashion to the contents
of the telegram. They did not believe it was coincidental that Oswald's
letter to the Embassy came immediately on the heels of the telegram
from the Department. This led to a discussion of the appearance in the
press of another telegram or report, from the Embassy in Moscow to
the Department. Mr. Rankin said he would undertake to clarify this.

6. Mr. Willems noted that Mrs. Oswald had introduced a state-
ment to the effect that she suspected her son to be a CIA agent. Mr.
Willems asked whether in fact Oswald had been a CIA agent. Mr. Helms
replied that he had not been. Mr. Willems then asked if there were any.
way of proving this. Mr. Helms first remarked that in him and Mr.
Murphy the Commission had the two Clandestine Services officers who
certainly would know whether or not Oswald had been an agent for CIA
in the Soviet Union. He then said that the Commission would have to
take his word for the fact that Oswald had not been an agent. Mr. Rankin
interjected the view that the Commission had not adopted this procedure
with other agencies and wondered whether there was not some way to
clarify this point more effectively for the Commission. One suggestion
he made was to have Mr. Dulles, who is familiar with CIA records
procedures, review the material which would normally be held on agents
and report to the Commission. Another suggestion was to follow the
lead of the Director of the FBI who forwarded an affidavit to the Com-.
mission regarding the nature of FBI relations with Oswald.

7. A considerable part of the meeting from this point forward
consisted of a review by Mr. Rankin and his staff of the gaps in their
investigation to date. They noted that the most significant gap appeared
in the Mexican phase. For example, they had no record of Oswald's

(
daily movements while in Mexico City nor could they confirm the date
of his departure or his mode of travel. The original assumption that
he had returned by bus could not be proven. Several possibilities were
discussed whereby the Commission could fill in the gaps of its investi-
gation of the Mexican phase. The suggestion was made that the most
effective way of resolving the questions they had would be to have a
member of the Commission visit Mexico City and discuss the issues on
the spot with those American and Mexican officials directly concerned.
Mr. Helms noted that it would be possible for a member of the Com-
mission to visit our Chief of Station who would then be able to work out
with the Warren Commission staff member the best way to handle inter-
views with Mexican police officials, particularly if it is desired that
these interviews be informal in nature. Our Chief of Station would also
be able to put the Warren Commission staff member in contact with the
FBI officials and Immigration and Naturalization Service officers stationed
in Mexico City. Mr. Helms cautioned that our Chief of Station would be 32
under State Department cover) and that it would be proper to advise the
Department of the planned visit and upon arrival to meet briefly with the
Ambassador or Minister Counselor before proceeding to work out details
with the CIA Chief of Station.

8. In connection with the Mexican phase of the investigation, mem-
bers of Mr. Rankin's staff questioned Mr. Helms and Mr. Rocca regarding
the extent of the CIA file on Oswald for the period 8 October to 22 November
1963. They questioned the sanitized extracts which they had been shown
and wondered if there were not more. Mr. Rocca summarized the ma-
terials that had come to the attention of the Secret Service, or had been
disseminated to the Secret Service, immediately after the assassination.
Mr. Rocca said there was not additional substantive information and that
the sanitized version seen by the Commission constituted the sum of our
holdings. Mr. Helms then explained that as a matter of practice we did
not release actual copies of our messages because they contained code-
words and digraphs which would be unintelligible to a person not familiar
with them. He added, however, that he would be happy to show the file
with the original messages to any staff member of the Warren Commission
who might come to visit him at Langley.

9. The question of why no action was taken by other agencies of
the government after their receipt of CIA information that Oswald was
in contact with the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City was next
discussed. Mr. Rankin and members of his staff clearly felt that this
was a crucial question which needed careful review. They appeared to
NW 78141
Docld:32201368 Page 5
EYES ONLY

believe that the information on Oswald was unusual enough to have
caused recipients to take special measures which might conceivably
have led to a closer scrutiny of Lee Harvey Oswald and his movements.
Mr. Helms pointed out that the information on Oswald's visit to the
Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City came from telephone inter-
cepts which were placed on both embassies. These intercepts were
recorded on tape and reviewed by persons at our Station for any infor-
mation affecting U. S. security. Such information is routinely passed
to other agencies and entered in CIA files. Given the enormous bulk
which is involved, the tapes are not kept on file but erased after a brief
period of time. Thus the information on Oswald was similar to that
provided on other American citizens who might have made contacts of
this type. In Oswald's case, it was the combination of visits to both
Cuban and Soviet Embassies which caused the Mexico City Station to
report this to Headquarters and Oswald's record of defection to the
Soviet Union which prompted the Headquarters dissemination. At the
conclusion of his remarks on this subject, Mr. Helms specified that
the information he had given Mr. Rankin was extremely sensitive and
that the very existence of these telephone intercepts had to be very
carefully protected.

10. The Commission, Mr. Rankin said, would be interested in
any information held by CIA on Jack Ruby. Mr. Rankin said the Com-
mission staff had prepared a roundup on Ruby, a copy of which he handed
Mr. Helms. He said he would appreciate any file reflections or comments
that CIA analysts might make on this material. Mr. Rankin and members..
of his staff then discussed Ruby's confirmed trip to Havana in 1959. The
Commission has received information from an unspecified source that
Ruby was in Havana again in 1963 under a Czech passport. Mr. Rankin
asked whether CIA could provide any assistance in verifying this story.
Mr. Helms replied that CIA would be limited in its possibility of assist-
ing, to air manifest checks in Mexico. These would be carried out he
said.

11. Mr. Helms was then asked if CLA had done any follow up to
its original telegraphic dissemination of the information on Oswald's
visits to the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City. Mr. Helms
replied that there had been no CIA action following our initial dissemi-
nation. Mr. Willems then asked if there were any liaison problems
faced by CIA in its efforts to deal with other agencies in matters affect-
ing internal security. Mr. Helms replied that there were always under-
standable human problems in conducting any liaison on any subject but

that by and large the procedures for dealing with internal security and
counterespionage information which needed to be brought to the attention
of other agencies were effective.

12. Mr. Willems then asked if CIA's intelligence collection system
was automated. Mr. Helms replied that we did in fact have a machine
records system for recovering file information which was unique in that
it had been designed specifically with the requirements of the CIA Clandes-
tine Services in mind. Thus, any information reposing in our files could
be recovered by means of this machine system rapidly and efficiently. Mr.
Helms invited Mr. Rankin and members of his staff to visit the Langley
Headquarters and inspect the machine records system which he had des-
cribed.

13. In speaking of the broader question of protection for the Pres-
ident, Mr. Rankin asked about our procedures for working with the Secret
Service when the President travels abroad. Mr. Helms described how
the system works and cited examples from the past to illustrate. He com-
mented on some of the South American trips and on the visit to West Berlin
to show the way in which the effectiveness and competence of the local
police force plays a key role in efforts to insure the President's safety.

14. Mr. Willems asked if we could check on a memorandum sent
to Mr. Karamessines on 12 February regarding one of the pictures identi-
fied by Mrs. Oswald as that of Jack Ruby. These pictures were from
clandestine photographic coverage of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City
which was provided by the FBI and then cropped to make a display to show
to Mrs. Oswald soon after the President's assassination. The Commission
has not been able to determine which of these pictures was shown Mrs.
Oswald. Mr. Rocca will follow up on this.

MEMORANDUM FOR: File

FROM: James B. Weidner

SUBJECT: Interview with John Stein

I interviewed Mr. Stein in his office at the CIA Headquarters, Langley,
Virginia on March 18, 1975. The interview commenced at 11:10 a. m. and
continued until approximately 1:20 p.m. No one else was present. At
the outset of the interview, Mr. Stein signed an Advice and Waiver which
is annexed hereto.

Mr. Stein, along with several other Deputies, were assigned to an Ad Hoc
Committee to review various alleged domestic activities of the CIA.
Stein's particular area was the counter-intelligence staff, except for
the activities of that staff relating to the CI/SO project and to the mail
intercept project.

Stein said that, after his review, he concluded that the job of the CI
staff was essentially to \"horse\" the FBI into doing something. In fact,
according to Stein, once you eliminate CI/SO and the mail intercept
project from the CI staff, their activities were benign insofar as the
scope of this Commission's scope of inquiry was concerned. He said
that, unless you conclude that keeping records relating to Americans,
per se, is improper, the CI staff files contained little of interest.

(a) Action-oriented Matters

I asked Stein whether he had found any evidence of domestic breaking
and entering directed by the CI staff. Stein said that he had found no
such activities, with one possible exception. Stein stated that, if such
activities seemed appropriate, the CI staff would inform the Bureau

NW 78141

DECLASSIFICATION AND/OR
RELEASE OF THIS DOGUMENT

which would accomplish the activities. This was because, if anything
were discovered by virtue of the action which would lead to a prosecution,
the action should be taken by the FBI, since the Department of Justice
would have responsibility for the prosecution.

The only possible exception to the absence of any \"breaking and entering\"
by the CI staff was the Tofti case. Tofti was a long term employee of
the Agency, who put his house up for rent. Coincidently, another Agency
employee went to look at the house for possible rental. In the course of so
doing, the second employee found that there were quite a number of
classified documents on the third floor of the house. The employee then
reported what he found to the Agency, which sent personnel over to recover
the documents. (The documents related to world-wide proprietaries of
the Agency with which Tofti had been involved. Ultimately, Tofti explained
that he intended to write a book about these matters and that was why the
records were in his home.) The Agency undoubtedly did not have time
to advise the Bureau much in advance (if at all) of the Agency's effort to
recover the subject documents. Stein also noted that this incident did not,
in fact, involve \"breaking and entering\" since the house was already opened
to allow prospective renters to examine it.

Stein said that he had found no instances of physical surveillance done by
the CI staff, although the staff would probably have been aware of surveillance
accomplished by other agency components or by the Bureau. Stein cited
as an example an instance where a female Agency employee was found to
be living with a man who could well have been working for a foreign
Government. The Office of Security, therefore, put a surveillance on her house
for approximately three weeks. Discussions were also had with an informant
within the Agency concerning this employee. (Files on this case would be
maintained by the Office of Security).

Stein found no evidence of any electronic surveillance or telephone taps
accomplished domestically by the CI staff. The staff had no personnel
who could actually take any action. The staff, in this regard, would
have had an advisory capacity, if it participated at all. The CI staff
would simply advise the Bureau or other components of the Agency such
as the Office of Security or the Office of Technical Services. In such
instances the CI staff would not hold the file, except perhaps a memorandum
relating to the particular case, but Stein found no such memoranda.

SECRET - SENSITIVE

As a digression, Stein commented that, to the extent that CI staff may
have gotten into \"gray\" areas, this may well have been as a result of
an effort to restrict knowledge of a particular incident to the smallest
possible number of people. Thus, rather than going to the Bureau, where
control over the dissimilation of the subject information would not be
possible, the staff might go to another Agency component such as the
Office of Security. Similarly, where an investigation proved fruitless, conti-
nued maintenance of relevant files by the CI staff, rather than by the Agency
or the Bureau generally, constituted part of an effort to avoid prejudicing
the particular subject of the investigation.

Another general area mentioned by Stein was that involving the use by
CI staff of people having an historical relationship with the staff. These
persons would be used against clearly foreign targets in the United States.
As an example, Stein said that such persons might be used to obtain access
to codes or the like in this country.

Stein mentioned the allegations relating to the reported breaking and entering
into the Chilian Embassy. I told him that we had already reviewed this
instance, and, therefore, there was no need for him to review it any detail.

(b) Files on Americans.

The major source of files on Americans maintained by CI staff was the
\"American Targets Program\" (ATP). This program involved informa-
tion received by CI staff from Agency sources, from the State Department,
and from the Military. Information might also be received from the FBI. The
purpose of ATP was to collate all contacts between any American and any
foreign intelligence officers, particularly those from the USSR. The concept
of the program was that all such contacts would be reported to CI staff,
which would index them for future reference.

Stein noted that, although the State Department actually had a formal regu-
lation requiring that all contacts with Soviets be reported, it was extremely
difficult to convince State officers so to report. Stein spent a substantial
amount of time overseas as under State cover. He said that, as a result of
that experience, he knows that State officers are reluctant to report this kind
of information. (A State officer probably will not achieve promotion by his
contact with Soviet personnel.) As a result of this reluctance, the informa-
tion obtained by the CI staff generally originated with the State Department's
Office of Security.

NW 78141
Docld:32201372 Page 4
SECRET - SENSITIVE -

SECRET SENSITIVE-

The ATP program for filing was simply that when a name was reported
to CI staff, it was mechanically processed by personnel who exercised
no judgment in recording the name. The names of both the Soviet and the
American people involved in the contact would be recorded. As a result of this
process, the ATP file index was able to develop a great deal of information
on Soviet contacts with Americans. If, as a result of information obtained,
CI staff had reason to believe that a aprticular person had been recruited
by the Soviets, that information would be forwarded to the Office of Security
for the Agency, if any Agency officer were involved, or to FBI, if an American
outside the Agency was involved.

Stein explained that this program was conducted by CI staff instead of by
the FBI or State, because the program might well contain information
which would be relevant to CIA purposes, but not relevant to the purposes
of the other Agencies. Thus, the files might well contain infor mation
concerning known KGB Agents. That information, in turn could have
derived from a sensitive source, the identity of which CIA would not want
to have revealed. Accordingly, the information was stored by the Agency
rather than the other possible Governmental components. Information
relevant to those components, however, was made available to them from
the ATP project.

The information utilized by ATP could have been derived, as noted, from
reports of other Governmental components or from infor mation provided
by any American. This would be information provided voluntarily, either
by a person actually having a contact with a foreign intelligence officer
or by persons with knowledge that someone else had had such a contact.
The information could be particularly useful, not only to the CIA, but to
other Governmental components. For example, the State Department's
Office of Security might report that a State officer had had a contact over
a long period with a Soviet. The CI staff could check all its information
on that Soviet and confirm whether they had reason to believe that the
Soviet was in fact an agent.

Another source of files on Americans held by CI staff might be the product
of code-breaking by NSA. Thus, in reading codes, names of Americans
may appear. Some of these may be innocuous, and some may be spies.
In any event, all these names are also indexed, although the index is
separate from ATP, because of the sensitivity of the NSA program as well
as the information derived therefrom.

NW 78141
Docld:32201372 Page 5
SECRET SENSITIVTY-

SECRET SENSITIVE-

The information plugged into the indexing system will not become an
actual file until there is some reason for opening a file on a particular
person. At that point (for example, a file search requested by another
Agency) all information relating to a particular person will be collated
in one place. This, in turn will be developed into a separate file (a
personality file). If the information on a particular person is requested
by a CIA field office, the collation process would occur and the field would
be told how the particular person had come to the attention of the Agency
in the first instance and would also be told any derogatory information which
the field station would want to know.

Other CI files derived from on-going cases. Part of these files emanate
from information provided to the Agency by defectors. For example, one
element of this information is designated \"Soviet leads.\" This is because the
CI staff learned from a defector that all Soviet women employed in the United
States Embassy in the USSR during a certain period were Soviet agents.
Some of these women, in turn, married Americans, and, as a result, now
live in the United States. The FBI is advised of the identity of all these
women The CI staff, under official cover, occasionally goes out to inter-
view these women, in an effort to convince them to reveal what they know
about KGB operations. The effort was first to determine whether the
women continue to be KGB agents, and, if not, to gather information from
them. The general modus operandi would be to tell the women that we know
that at one time they were KGB agents and, while we did not intend to take
any action against them, to request them to reveal information that they
may have learned at that time concerning KGB operations. Generally,
the women would agree to do so. If they did not, then ontract would, at
in short,
Teast temporarily, be dropped. These women are used a's \"defectors who
did not defect\"

Other examples of going cases are: a journalist who had private contact
with George Blake, a former KGB agent in England; an American who
was tied into the Able case (in this instance, the actions are taken by
the Bureau, but guidance/given by CI staff); and a journalist who the KGB,
on three occasions, attempted unsuccessfully to recruit. *

Other files may relate to actions begun because of some kind of counter-
intelligence implication in a particular situation. In these instances CI
would maintain the files because of the particular sensitivity of the matter,
even though action may be taken by another Agency component.

*Stein noted that the decision as to whether to utilize someone as a double agent is.
made by the CIA. If the decision is affirmative, the double agent would be handled by the
Agency (if he is abroad) or by the FBI (if he is in this country). The only exceptions to
this pattern would be where the double Agent is in the United States for only a brief time
or where he has a special relationship with a particular CIA officer.

Other files are maintained concerning the Soviet Embassy. CIA's position
on this matter is that this is a State case which the Agency is running on
behalf of State.

There is also a file on Vesco held by the CI Staff. The Agency became
involved in this situation because John Dean of the White House called and
stated that President Nixon's brother had obtained a job with IOS. He
wanted to know what IOS was all about. CIA, in fact, had a file on IOS,
because it was known that the Soviets had been attempting to penetrate that
institution as a vehicle for getting agents into this country or at least
allowing them to learn of economic matters relating to the United States.
Stein said that, at one point, Vesco's lawyer called to say that he wanted
to have an account of everything which had been said about Vesco over
South American radio channels. The Agency refused this request, stating
that it was beyond its charter.

(c) Defectors

There are four sorts of defectors handled by the CI Staff. The first
group are those under low level cover which are being used to scan Soviet
publications and to extract anything relating to Soviet intelligence which
they, in light of their expertise, may recognize. The second group of
defectors are those with \"talents\". This group are former KGB agents
who, as a result, have special knowledge. They may be used from time
to time to go and talk with (either in the United States or abroad) USSR
citizens. Another sort of defector is one from Czechoslovakia. This
particular person is highly knowledgable in Maxist-Leninist matters.
Accordingly, he is used to write propaganda which is disseminated abroad.
The last category of defectors are those who are no longer in regular
contact with the agent. These particular persons are seen from time to
time for some particular reason which could simply be an administrative
matter concerning their pensions, etc.

The CI Staff also maintains a file on defectors from America
to some other country (such as the Soviet Union, Cuba and others).
These names are recorded because the persons involved may eventually
end up in the United States once again or in some country other than the
Soviet Bloc. This would not necessarily mean that that person is a spy,
but it does mean that he would be of counter-intelligence interest, At
approximately the time of the Kennedy assassination the Secret Service
and the FBI became particularly interested in potential defectors from

NW 78141

the United States. (Recall that Oswald had had connections with Russia).
This was an operation which the CIA did not particularly want to under-
take. Nonetheless the Agency did trace the names which the Bureau and
Secret Service provided in this regard. The number of these names was
perhaps 2,000 including crackpots who may have as an off hand comment,
suggested that they intended to defect to, for example, Russia. The CIA
attempted to turn the program over to the Secret Service for the Bureau, but they
would not take it. The CIA ultimately stopped the project and cleared all the
files out. This would have been approximately three years ago. Stein noted
that although the files had been eliminated, it was possible that some of
the names provided to the Agency had made it into the Central Agency files,
and would not have been eliminated therefrom.

I briefly discussed the NOSENKO Case with Stein. Nosenko had defected
to the United States and was admitted to this country as a \"parolee\". That
is, the Immigration and Naturalization Bureau have a quota of persons
which the Agency can bring into the country without regular immigration
papers. These persons are the responsibility of the Agency. There was
some initial doubt, as to whether, in fact, Nosenko had been sent to the
United States by the KGB. Information obtained from another defector
tended to confirm this suspicion. The question then was what to do with
Nosenko. It was decided for a variety of reasons, that it would be unwise to
attempt to deport him; as a result, he was kept in the United States in isolation.
After several years it was determined that Nosenko was, in fact, not an
attempted double agent. He was thereafter rehabilitated and now lives
happily in the United States. Although the CI had an interest in this case,
it was actually run by the Office of Security.

As one aspect of the Agency's duty to help in services of common concern
to all Governmental agencies, the CIA recorded in computer form at the
request of the FAA, all information relating to hijackers, Stein thinks that
this was probably because the CIA had the only equipment which could
handle the needed material in the proper fashion. The information so
provided would, for example, include names of all those who were on board
hijacked planes. Approximately two years ago the CIA tried to give this
program to the FAA. That Agency, however, would not accept the program,
and, therefore it was terminated by CIA.

OLSEN: Frank, continuing from our interview of yesterday which
was being taken down by a court reporter, as you can see we don't have
a court reporter present this morning, which is Friday, April 4, 1975,
and we are beginning at 9:15 am. Do you understand, Frank and Wilfredo,
that you are still under oath as you were yesterday and that this is a
continuation of the deposition in effect that was being taken yesterday?

STURGIS: Yes, sir.
NAVARRO: Yes, sir.
OLSEN: All right. We are going to have to stop from time to time
to change belts, but we will try to speed it along as fast as we can.
Yesterday we were talking about an approach which was made to you in
Miami sometime after you had returned to the United States from Cuba
in 1959, in which you were asked if you would be willing to undertake
an assassination?

STURGIS: Yes, sir.

OLSEN: Would you tell us this morning who it was that approached
you with that subject.

OLSEN: Mr. Sturgis has asked that we go off the record and we have
had a conversation off the record, during the course of which Mr. Navarro
was invited to leave the room and he is now absent from the room. The
only parties present in the room at this time are Mr. Sturgis and myself.
Now the question that I put to you, Frank, was: Can you identify for us
at this time who it was that approached you with the question of whether
you would participate in the performance of an assassation?

STURGIS: Bernard L. Barker.
OLSEN: And when was it, as best you now recall, Frank, that that
approach was made?

STURGIS: I believe it was in approximately 1961, either before the
Bay of Pigs or it was after the Bay of Pigs.

OLSEN: Was it very shortly before or shortly after?
STURGIS: I would be very honest with you, I don't remember.
OLSEN: Well, the Bay of Pigs operation actually took place in April
of 1961, didn't it?

STURGIS: 1961, Yes, sir.
OLSEN: As I understand from your testimony yesterday, when you were
approached about this, you indicated that you would be willing to do so.

STURGIS: Yes, sir.
OLSEN: But you thereafter checked with Sam Jenis about what he
thought about it, and Sam Jenis indicated to you that he thought you
should cooperate with Barker, but that you should make sure that it was
going to be an authorized operation by insisting to Barker that the word

come to you directly from someone who has identified himself as Barker's
Case Officer. Is that a fair statement of what you have just told me?

STURGIS: Either his Case Officer, or his Station Chief.
OLSEN: Did you know at that time who Barker's Case Officer was?
STURGIS: I assumed at that time that it was possible that it was
Eduardo, who he was the assistant under Eduardo.

OLSEN: But, am I correct in understanding now that you do not know
whether Eduardo was still on the scene or whether he had been replaced?

STURGIS: No, sir, I do not know. Now let me say this. I did
ask E. Howard Hunt do use the code name Eduardo while we were in Danbury,
Connecticut, and present

OLSEN: Now you are talking about 1972?
STURGIS: Now we are talking about 1972. I asked him if he gave
any orders to Bernie, or Barker, or Maucho, whatever these names
I called him by these names.

OLSEN: In other words, Barker was known as either Bernie or Maucho?
STURGIS: Right.
OLSEN: Okay.
STURGIS: I did ask Howard: Did you ever ask Maucho Barker to do
an assassination, to approach me on an assassination. He says \"Hell, no\".

OLSEN: That was Mr. Hunt's answer to you in 1972?
STURGIS: Right.
OLSEN: All right then. Did you thereafter-- going back to the 1961--
did you have any further conversation with Bernard Barker about the subject?

STURGIS: Yes, sir. I was advised to not to discuss the assassination
attempt with him to let Bernie bring up the subject whenever I saw him.
Bernie did bring up the subject

OLSEN: Where did you talk to Bernie the next time about this subject?
STURGIS: It was either one or two places; it was either at his
home in the --I believe the northwest section of town, or at a dinner that
he invited me to at a steak house--and I believe it was a ranch house; this
ranch house was located on 36th Street just before LeJuene Road.

OLSEN: And what happened when you next met with Barker about the
subject?

STURGIS: He told me that this invitation was his Case Officer
said \"Take Frank out and have a dinner.\"

OLSEN: And what did he do? Did he explore further your willingness
to undertake this?

STURGIS: Yes. Bernie asked me how I would go about it were the
subject about the assassination, and he asked me how I would do it. And
I told him, I says \"Well, it would all depend. I don't want to know the
man or the victim's name at this time, but it would depend on the man,
his position, for me to determine how I would get rid of the man.

OLSEN: And also where?
STURGIS: Where--the location, right. Also, in the conversation I
told him--he went into detail with me, and he said that there was a possibility
that he would like to go on the thing with me. And I told him that \"Well
Bernie, I don't like anybody to come with me, I'll be very honest with you.
I prefer to do it myself,\" because naturally I did not want to have a
witness to something that I would do even if he is an agent or not, that
I would do the thing. He said \"Well, how could I know that it was done.\"

I says, \"Well, there are several ways; No. 1, the person would eventually
be reported missing; No. 2, I will cut off his ear or his finger and give
it to you.\" I says, \"because there won't be no body to recover.\" I told
him he says how would you do it? I says \"well, I could go the
Everglades; I could dig a hole and put lye în it--the lye will eat up his
body; I could take an airplane and fly over the gulfstream and I could
dump hìm in the gulfstream weighted down I would have to cut his
stomach and his intestines so that he wouldn't float. Even weighted
down, a body will float unless you cut open the insides of his stomach
and intestines\" \"Or, I says, \"I could go with a boat out into the gulf-
stream and use explosives in order to destroy the body completely.\"

OLSEN: Did you know at that time where this assassination attempt
was to be undertaken in Florida?

STURGIS: No, sir; I again --knowing how agents work because I
in turn have trained some people as far as intelligence was concerned;
there is such a thing called compartmentation, and even though I was willing
to go on this assassination, at that time I did not want to know who the
person was in case if I did not do the assassination and someone else did
the assassination, at least if it was uncovered that I would not be brought
în as some one knew of the conspiracy to assassinate someone here if it was
onwhe
in the United States or a foreign country.

OLSEN: Frank, did anything further transpire about this assassination?
Other than this second conversation with Barker?

STURGIS: No, sir. Nothing came about because I nailed him to the
wall, telling Barker that I would want someone much higher than he who would
identify himself, his position with the company, and then I would do the
operation.

OLSEN: Did anybody ever contact you then who was higher in the
company?

STURGIS: No, sir. No one, but I still maintained my friendship
with Barker throughout these years.

OLSEN: So that ended the matter with respect to assassinations?
STURGIS: Yes, sir.

OLSEN: All right, here we go back on record. And let the record
show that Mr. Roethe has just recently re-entered the office and is now
present for the rest of the conference. Jim, in order that your voice
get picked up properly on this thing, would you move closer pick a
chair that is a little closer to the mike.

Continuing then, Frank, did you ever have any further contact
with anyone who you believed had any connection whatever with the Central
Intelligence Agency about an assassination?

STURGIS: No, sir. Maucho Barker was the only one at that time.
Now, Maucho asked me to help some other leaders who naturally were in
touch with him. You must understand that because he asked me you can
understand his position; his position was political under Eduardo;
as I said before, E. Howard Hunt or Eduardo was a political officer with
CIA with the planning of the Bay of Pigs invasion.

(
OLSEN: Well, what I'm getting at is: Did anybody ever contact you--
that is, anybody who had any connection whatever with the CIA, contact you
about an assassination after the one that you have just described to us?

STURGIS: In the United States, No, sir.

STURGIS: Well, with the United States Embassy, Colonel Nichols.
OLSEN: This was while you were still in Cuba?
STURGIS: Yes, sir.
OLSEN: Before leaving there in June 1959?
STURGIS: Yes, sir. That's in the first part of January and
February of 1959.

OLSEN: Well, these were all discussed with us yesterday on the
record when you described to us the discussions that took place among
officials of the Cuban Air Force and Cuban Army about plans to assassinate
Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, and Che Guevara?

STURGIS: Yes, sir.
OLSEN: And people of their entourage.
STURGIS: Yes, sir..
OLSEN: And you described yesterday some exercises that were worked
up, plans that were drawn up with respect to possible places to perform
the assassinations?

STURGIS: Yes, sir.
OLSEN: And then you described to us yesterday the fact that Colonel
Nichols had on the occasions when you had discussed it with him

OLSEN: Now, in addition to those discussions that took place
in Cuba early in 1959, when you were an officer of the Cuban Air Force,
and the discussions that you had with Bernard Barker sometime in 1961
about a possible assassination of some unnamed person at an unnamed
location, have you ever had any other discussions with anybody whatever
associated with the United States Government about assassinations?

STURGIS: No, sir; not that I can remember at this time.
OLSEN: You mentioned to me when we talked over the telephone,
Frank, that you had had some contact with or some relationship with
a planned assassination of Premier Castro in New York. What was that
that you were referring to?

STURGIS: There was a time--I don't remember the exact date--
that Fidel was in New York; there was a conspiracy or at least talk
of a conspiracy to want to kill him. Now as far as CIA is concerned,
I don't believe that they were involved or any agents were involved in
that conspiracy.wanting to assassinate Fidel.

OLSEN: Was this then something that was discussed among elements
of the Cuban exiles in Florida?

STURGIS: Yes, sir. New York and Florida.
OLSEN: Did you have any contact or know of any contact whatever
in connection with such discussions of assassinating Premier Castro in
New York-- did you have any contact whatever with anybody in the Government
of the United States?

STURGIS: That is very difficult to answer, Mr. Olsen, because
of the dates. învolved. I would think that I had contact with the Agency,
but again I will state that whether they knew about or were involved in
any conspiracy myself I do not know.

OLSEN: Well, when you say you had some contact with somebody
from the Agency, did you have some contact with somebody from the Agency
about such an assassination?

STURGIS: No, sir. No, I did not.
OLSEN: Was there any contact that you have had of any nature
relating to any assassination any place with any official of the United
States Government, other than the ones that you have already described
to me?
[off the record]

OLSEN: All right, we are going back on the record again. Mr. Sturgis having
said he was having difficulty thinking about exactly what answer he would
give to the question that was posed because he didn't want to use up tape
time while he was engaged in his thinking process. He has--while we have
been off the record--explored the subject with us further and is now prepared
to answer the question. Go ahead, Frank.

STURGIS: After that meeting with Barker, I, as far as I know, with
the Cuban friends of mine who were working with the company or who was working
under the company, there was a great deal of talk among the Cubans about wanting
to assassinate Fidel Castro in New York, inside of Cuba, or in Latin America
because Fidel did make several trips. There were talk, but as far as I know
I don't know if CIA sponsored any of the Cubans in any attempt to kill Fidel
or finance them in any attempt to kill him, nor supported any attempt by the
Cubans to want to kill him, or whether these Cubans were simply patriots or
were working for or associated with CIA.

OLSEN: You don't know then, Frank, whether any of this conversation
about killing Fidel Castro was initiated or promoted or sponsored in any
fashion by the Central Intelligence Agency?

attempt or discussion in any other assassination attempt on any one.
OLSEN: Did you ever have any conversation with anybody about
assassinating President Kennedy?

STURGIS: No, sir.
OLSEN: Did you ever have any conversation with anyone about
assassinating Attorney General, or later, Senator Robert Kennedy?

STURGIS: No, sir.
OLSEN: Did you ever have any conversation about assassinating
Martin Luther King or any other legislative or executive or public figure
in the United States?

STURGIS: No, sir.
[End of Tape #2]

OLSEN: All right, we are beginning belt No. 3 of this interview
with Frank Sturgis on Friday, April 4, 1975. Frank, you have just told us
that you have never had any conversations with anybody relating to the
assassination of President Kennedy or any other political or other public
figure in the United States. Is that correct?

STURGIS: Yes, sir.
OLSEN: Did you have any part whatever in planning or carrying out
the assassination of President Kennedy or any other public figure of the
United States?

OLSEN: Were you in Dallas at any time in November 1963?
STURGIS: I don't recall, sir, but I do know one thing I was not
in Dallas on November--I believe it was--November 22, 1963, when
President Kennedy was assassinated.

OLSEN: Where were you on that day?
STURGIS: I was at home in Miami.
OLSEN: Were you literally at home, or were you at work?
STURGIS: I remember, sir, that I saw the assassination of
President Kennedy on television.

OLSEN: Now, of course, it had been taped on television; so
you could have seen it anytime during that day or the succeeding days.
It was replayed many times on television, wasn't it?

STURGIS: Yes, sir.
(
OLSEN: Where were you when you first heard that President Kennedy
had been shot.

STURGIS: At my home.
OLSEN: Who was with you in your home at that time?
STURGIS: My wife, Mrs. Janet Sturgis; my mother-in-law, Mrs. Elizabeth
Hunt; and I believe, my nephew, James Hunt.

OLSEN: And, is your mother-in-law alive today?
STURGIS: No, sir, she is dead.
OLSEN: When did she die?
STURGIS: You will have to call my wife. My mother-in-law lived

1963, occurred at about 1:30 in the afternoon Miami time, can you tell us what
you were doing at home on a Friday at 1:30, when the news first came that the

STURGIS: No, sir, I couldn't. All I know is that I was home at that
OLSEN: What kind of a job did you have at that time?
STURGIS: 1963 would be very difficult for me at the present time to
just remember what I was doing in 1963
OLSEN: Were you selling used cars at that time?
STURGIS: I really don't know at this time. It is possible because
I was involved through the years in selling used cars.

OLSEN: How did you first get the news that the President had
been shot?

STURGIS: On television.
OLSEN: And did you remain at home the rest of the day?
STURGIS: Well I was at home for that day.
OLSEN: But I said, did you remain at home for the rest of the
day after getting the news?

STURGIS: I'm sorry. Yes, sir, I did.
OLSEN: And were there anybody else who was aware of the fact that
you were at home that day other than your wife, your mother-in-law, and
your wife's nephew?

STURGIS: To the best that I can remember, sir, I believe they were
the only ones I'm not too sure if anyone else stopped by the house or
anything.

OLSEN: Do you recall calling anybody or talking to anybody that
day by telephone or in person?

STURGIS: Well, not exactly, because everyone was upset in the house
because of the assassination.

OLSEN: Were you ever taken into custody by any police in Dallas?
STURGIS: No, sìr. Never.
OLSEN: Have you ever visited the scene of the assassination of
President Kennedy in Dallas?

STURGIS: No, sir. Never have.
OLSEN: Have you turned over to us, Mr. Sturgis, a series of some
30 to 35 photographs taken of yourself in the late 1950's and early 1960's
for purposes of identification of what you looked like in those days?
STURGIS: Yes, sir.
OLSEN: Do we have your permission to have those photographs
copied and analyzed to determine whether there is any correspondence be-
tween your appearance at that time and the appearance of certain persons
who were taken into custody in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963?
STURGIS: Yes, sir. You have my permission.
ROETHE: Have those photographs been dated by you on the back of
each photograph?

STURGIS: Yes, sir. These photographs have been dated to the best of
my knowledge. They should be the correct date or approximately that date.
OLSEN: There are several instances, Frank, in which a date shows
on the print itself, where you have separately identified the year in which

Would they be generally within six months or less of the
date that the photographs were taken?

OLSEN: Frank, we have handed to you for your examination a series
of five photographs which have been marked as \"Groden Exhibits 9A, 9B, 9С,
9D and 9E', depicting certain persons who were being accompanied by police
in Dallas, Texas, as they were walking along in the general vicinity of
the Texas School Book Depository; can you tell us whether any of those
photographs show you?

STURGIS: The people in the photograph that I have seen were not me.
OLSEN: Did you recognize any of the people in the photographs?
STURGIS: No, sir, I did not.
OLSEN: Can you tell us whether in your opinion any of those photo-
graphs show E. Howard Hunt?

STURGIS: Not that I know, sir, because at that time I did not know
E. Howard Hunt.

[Off the record]
OLSEN: We have again bean off the record for a few moments while
I have been thinking about the next line of inquiry or whether there is in
fact anything else that we would like to talk to Frank Sturgis about. And
we've concluded that we are about finished with the interview, but Mr. Sturgis
has indicated that he would like to make a statement to us about his willingness
to submit himself to a polygraph dealing with certain subjects that we have

STURGIS: Yes, sir, Mr. Olsen, I am willing to take a polograph
on the subject of either conspiracy on my part or the attempt on the
attempt to assassination of President Kennedy, Martin Luther King,
Robert Kennedy, or any official of the United States Government. Plus,
I am willing to take a polygraph on what I have just told you about
Bernie Barker asking me about an assassination attempt.

OLSEN: You're talking about these two conversations now that
you had with Bernie Barker in which in about 1961 he approached you
about your willingness to perform an assassination on some unknown person
at some unknown place?

STURGIS: Yes, sir. I'll take a polygraph on that too, if necessary.
OLSEN: Is there anything else, Frank, that you would like to
(
reveal to the Commission, that you would like to talk to the Commission about,
relating to the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency in any respect
whatever?

STURGIS: Yes, sir. I would like to make this statement. I think
that there are elements in this country who are trying to destroy the Central
Intelligence Agency. I believe in order for a country to have some defense
or to protect our national security we do need an agency like Central Intelli-
gence Agency. I do feel that there may be elements within Central Intelligence
Agency who probably who have exceeded their orders and so forth, that may have
went off on some things of their own that probably either their Station Chief
or sometimes the Case Officer or anyone higher than whoever the people are
that may have or would want to do certain illegal activities.

are at the end of another belt on the dictating unit, but I do want to come

bit further urther about about any connections that you may have had with the assassina-
tion of President Kennedy.

First, let me ask you, have you ever in your life met
Lee Harvey Oswald?

STURGIS: Not that I can remember, sir.
OLSEN: Do you know whether you had any contact with him in
Florida?

STURGIS: Not that I can remember, sir.
OLSEN: Do you ever recall having had any contacts with somebody
by the name of Jack Ruby--either in the United States, Cuba, or elsewhere?

STURGIS: No, sìr.

did you ever meet anybody in Cuba or in Florida by the name of Jack
Rubenstein, or Jake Rubenstein?

STURGIS: Not that I can remember sir.

Movement in New Orleans?

time în 1962 or 1963?

STURGIS: I can't remember, sir. I don't recall the dates.
OLSEN: What was the occasion for your being in New Orleans?
STURGIS: I believe once or twice in leaving the country, one time
I believe going to Panama,
OLSEN: That is, you just flew to New Orleans in order to catch
a flight to Panama?

STURGIS: To Panama. A direct flight to Panama. Also a direct flight
to Guatamala when I went there to visit President Udios (?).
OLSEN: And, on either of those occasions did you go into the
City of New Orleans or did you just stay at the airport between flights?

STURGIS: I stayed at a motel, which I believe was one of the largest
motels in New Orleans. I did go into the French Quarter in New Orleans one
time--the date I don't remember. But it was on one of these visits.
OLSEN: Was it just for an evening on the town, or what?
STURGIS: Yes, sir.
OLSEN: Just for social contact?
STURGIS: Yes, sir. Because New Orleans is a famous city in the
French Quarter and I wanted to at least if I had the time at that time at
the motel to visit the French Quarter.

as the \"Fair Play for Cuba Committee\"?

initiated in New Orleans by District Attorney Jim Garrett?

several days after the assassination.

OLSEN: Were you contacted and visited by the FBI shortly after
the assassination of President Kennedy?

STURGIS: Yes, sir.
OLSEN: Who contacted you?
STURGIS: Two Special Agents from the Bureau, FBI. I believe one of
the agents--if I'm not mistaken--his name was Bob Davis.

STURGIS: They wanted to know my whereabouts before, during and after
the assassination of President Kennedy.
OLSEN: Did they say why they wanted to know your whereabouts?
STURGIS: Yes, sir. In the friendly(?) discussion that we had there--
I believe it lasted maybe two hours, to two and a half hours-- I asked why
that they wanted to speak with me concerning this. And they said, \"Well,

this sort of thing.\"

MR. RUSK: I do.

TESTIMONY OF DEAN RUSK

MR. BELIN: Could you please state your name for
the record?

MR. RUSK: Dean Rusk.

MR. BELIN: And you served as Secretary of State, sir,
in the Administrations of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, is
that correct?

MR. RUSK: Yes.

Secretary Udall, Secretary Freeman and I were the
only three who served throughout the terms of both Presidents.

MR. BELIN: Secretary Rusk, what is your present
occupation?

MR. RUSK: I am Professor of International Law in the
School of Law in the University of Georgia.

MR. BELIN: And prior to your service as Secretary of
State with the Kennedy Administration, could you give us a little
bit of a summary of your background?

MR. RUSK: Well, I was President of the Rockefeller

Foundation and General Education Board for about eight years
during the 1950's. During the Truman Administration, with the
exception of a few months when I was Special Assistant to the
Secretary of War, Robert Patterson, I was in the State Department
under Secretaries Marshall and Acheson, first in charge of
United Nations Affairs, then Deputy Under Secretary for
Political Affairs, and then Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern
Affairs.

Prior to that, I had over five years of active duty
during World War II, and prior to that, teaching at Mills
College in California while studying law at Berkeley.

MR. BELIN: During World War II, you were involved
somewhat with intelligence, is that correct?

MR. RUSK: Yes, I was. I was in G-2 from October in
1941 until the summer of 143 when I went out to the China,
Burma, India theatre. There I was Chief of War Plans, and had
a relation with the operations of OSS of the China, Burma, India
theatre.

MR. BELIN: Could you briefly give us an overview from
your personal experience as to what kind of intelligence the
United States government had during World War II?

MR. RUSK: Well, I think it is important for us to
realize that in the background of CIA was a shocking ignorance
of world affairs and situations in other parts of the world at

the outbreak of World War II. As a Captain in the Army, I was
called back to G-2 in October, 1941, two months before Pearl
Harbor, to organize a new section of G-2 to cover everything
from Afghanistan through the India Subcontinent, Burma, Ceylon,
Malaya, Australia, New Zealand and the British Pacific Islands.
They had no section in G-2 interested in that part of the world
up to that point.

When I got there I asked to see what materials we
had on hand as a start, and I was shown one file drawer by an
old lady named Mrs. North. In that file drawer was one copy of
Murphy's Tourist Handbook to India and Ceylon which had been
stamped Confidential because it was the only copy in town, and
they wanted to keep track of it; one 1925 military attache
report from London on the British Army in India; and then a
considerable number of clippings from the New York Times that
this old lady, Mrs. North, had been clipping since World War I,
and that was it.

Well, I passed my first test, because on the second
day that I was there, a Colonel from the great War Plans Division
of the General Staff called down and said, Rusk, I can't remember,
is Indochina in South China or North China, and when I located
Indochina for him he hung up in great satisfaction and feeling
that he had great intelligence support from G-2.

Now, there is no way to describe how deficient we were
and we had to scramble around and try to find a missionary here

or a businessman there, or anybody who knew anything about some
of these vast areas and, of course, we could get a good deal of
information from the British, but you couldn't overload those
lines all of the time, because we were starting from scratch.

We flew the hump with maps that were supposed to be
on a scale of 1 to 1 million, but much of the material on those
maps was purely honorary. I mean, I didn't even have maps that
would show us the scale of 1 to 1 million the terrain in which
we were operating. We tried to organize a Burmese language
program in our Army and we looked around the United States for
a native Burman. We asked the Census Bureau for a list of the
people living here who had been born in Burma and they came up
with about twelve names, but most of them were McDougall or
McLanahan, the children of British soldiers who were born in
Burma. We finally found one and we looked him up and he was in
an insane asylum.

Well, we fished him out of the insane asylum and made
a Burmese language instructor out of him.

The impact of this on the need for information after
World War II cannot be exaggerated, because we just ran all the
time, we were running into this factor of ignorance, and so I
think it is important to bear that in mind. And I hope we will
never get caught in that situation again.

MR. BELIN: Subsequent to World War II, with the
build-up of the CIA and other intelligence agencies, of course,

the information gathering facilities of the U.S. government
became much greater. And I wonder if you have any opinion as
to whether or not we might have at times gone to the other
extreme so far as the storage of information?

MR. RUSK: I think partly because of this absence of
information earlier that we tended to let intelligence become
a thing in itself. I had the impression, for example, that in
the intelligence community, and I don't point the finger at any
particular agency, there developed a kind of a catalogue of
desirable information, almost as a Sears, Roebuck catalogue, and
it was the duty of the intelligence community to fill in all of
discretion?
the blanks. I hope the Commission will use disgression in what
it does with some of the examples I might give here today,
because I don't want to cause difficulty, but for example,
Ambassador David Bruce in London told me that a member of the
British Government had come to him and said, David, don't have
your military attache planes flying over our factories at low
level taking pictures. If you want pictures of our plants, we
will give them to you, but all of this kind of business makes
our workers nervous, and people don't know what's going on.
All they were doing was filling in the blanks, and we tended to
go at it without a direct relationship to what might be called
policy needs. And I think this was one of the inherent senses
of one's ignorance of pre-World War II times.

MR. BELIN: I think you also mentioned during our

interview last night that you thought the syndrome of avoiding
another Pearl Harbor might have contributed to trying to collect
a tremendous amount of information, and you gave as an example
the attack on South Korea by North Korea.

MR. RUSK: Yes.

Our intelligence did not predict Pearl Harbor, but
they certainly predicted the Roberts Commission. And I think
that that experience has infected to some extent the intelligence
community.

Now, I once wrote Mr. Schlesinger a little note about
this and one or two other matters when he became Director of
CIA. One of the nightmares of people in the intelligence
community is to have something serious happen which they have
not predicted, and so one of the results of that is that
policy offices get a continual flow of possibilities, 90 or 95
percent of which never happen at all, and the policy officer
has the problem then of trying to sort out which is for real and
which is not. And that is, sometimes, very difficult.

In the case of Korea, after the North Korean attack
was launched, people went back through thousands of bits of
information. They came out with a handful, six or eight pieces
on the basis of which some of them said oh, yes, you see, we
knew this was coming. Well, no one picked up the phone and
called me. I was Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern
Affairs at that time, and no one picked up the phone and called

me and said the North Koreans are going to attack. On that
evening, I was having dinner with Judge Alsop and Mr. Dace and
Justice Frankfurter, and I certainly would not have been out
having dinner if I knew that an attack was imminent.

Indeed, Mr. John Foster Dulles, who was in Tokyo at
the time, said it was not until the Tuesday after the Sunday
of the attack that the MacArthur Headquarters accepted that it
was anything more than a border incident, and so I think we tend
to multiply alleged predictions, partly to cover your trail in
case something happens, and I think this is something that
policy officers have to get used to, and on which they have to
make some discriminating judgments.

And it emphasizes the importance of multiple sources
of information.

Now, when I was a Special Assistant to Judge Patterson,
the Secretary of War, I personally supported his efforts to
combine all of the intelligence agencies into a single agency
and put them altogether in one organization. I since have
changed my mind radically on that because I think it is very
important that you have not competitive sources of information
but diverse sources of information. One of the several reasons
for the tragic mistake in the Bay of Pigs was that those who
proposing the operation were the same people who were furnishing
the information on which judgments were to be made. And I had
a specific directive from the President not to consult my own

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the Department of State
to get their judgment on the situation inside Cuba.

So I think it is very important that we maintain
diverse sources of information as a kind of check against each
other, among other things, and also because that way you get
some insights and some guesses that might not come through a
single channel.

MR. BELIN: And so what you are saying is that some
duplication, perhaps, so far as the sources on a particular
problem, might not be adverse to the best interests of the
country?

MR. RUSK: Well, I think there should be a very full
exchange of information among the different elements of the
intelligence community. But I think we ought to, that we
ought to have diverse sources of judgment, of analysis, and
matters of that sort.

MR. BELIN: Now, to go back to your previous comment
concerning the Pearl Harbor syndrome and to cover all bases, is
it a fair statement that perhaps the inundation of thousands
of pieces of information to cover all possibilities does not
necessarily lead to the best kinds of intelligence?

MR. RUSK: Well, we are faced, the intelligence
community is faced, with an inherently difficult problem because
of the blizzard of information that has fallen in on the world.

Now, a very large part of the CIA's information

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

gathering has to do with getting materials that are in the
public sector, publications from all over the world including
the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and the
sheer management analysis of the information that is available
in the public sector is a massive problem.

Now, the processes by which that mass is reduced to
some estimates or judgments are very important. To some extent,
policy officers are the prisoners of the information they have
available to them, and policy officers should be in a pretty
sceptical frame of mind about decisions. I mean about judgments
of that sort.

Very often we try to get information that is not
present in the real world, and we ought to, I think, be a little
more candid in saying to ourselves that we don't know, but if
you want our guess, here's our guess.

For example, on a certain Tuesday evenining in August,
1968, Russian forces went into Czechoslovakia. We thought later
that we had learned that the Russians had made that decision on
the preceeding Saturday night, three days earlier, Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday.

Now, if we had asked our intelligence community before
that Saturday night whether or not the Russians were going into
Czechoslovakia, there is no way they could know, because the
Russians didn't know. I mean, I used to smile occasionally at
the enormous effort made by foreign people, foreign governments,

to ascertain our intentions when I knew we didn't have any
intentions, and so I think we ought to distinguish more clearly
between information that is real and information or estimates
that are rather speculative in character.

MR. BELIN: I am going to change the subject now to
the statutes which were adopted by the Congress and which
formed the charter of the CIA.

Last night, you had some comments concerning your
observation of these statutes on the relationship to what has
actually happened since the enactment of the statutes.

MR. RUSK: Well, I think one must bear in mind that
these statutes are the public expressions of the will of the
Congress, and there are some things that you don't say publicly.
You don't lay out in the statute a capability, say, for political
observations in a particular situation. You don't lay out in
the statute, a public statute, the complete functions of the
National Security Agency, for example.

Now, I don't think there was any doubt in the minds of
the Congress over these past twenty-eight years that CIA had
certain capabilities in the political action field as well as in
the espionage, counter-espionage field, or any doubt about the
real purposes and functions of the National Security Agency.

And so although as a matter of law this may raise some curious
questions, I don't think that one can honestly say that the
Congress was in any way misled about what kind of an organization

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

CIA was, or what kind of an organization NSA is.

There was a kind of a common law of the matter behind
the written word, or there was whatever you want to call it, I
will leave that to the distinguished members of your Commission.

But some of these things that have been criticized lately as a
part of the attack on the CIA I do not think can be measured by
reading the exact wording of the public aspects of the CIA
charter.

MR. BELIN: Is it your understanding that at least
the Oversight Committee leaders of Congress did basically know
major areas of policy determination by the CIA?

MR. RUSK: Yes.

To what extent, I don't know. I do know that the
Director of CIA consulted frequently with Senator Russell, for
example. He was the one who had basically handled CIA's budget
since he was chairman of the Armed Services Committee and
practically chairman of the Appropriations Committee because of
the chairman's age, and I know that there were pretty frequent
discussions between the two of them.

I never sat in on any of those, so I can't testify
directly as to what was said. But I had a good many discussions
myself with Senator Russell on a good many foreign policy
matters, and I never heard him complain about feeling that he
needed to be better informed.

MR. BELIN: Now, we also discussed the practical fact

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

of how CIA in your phrase was drawn into things that other
agencies might not, or might have done if they had had the
money available overtly, but they did not have, and the CIA was
drawn in because CIA had the money.

Is that a fair summary of our discussion?

MR. RUSK: Yes.

A good many things that CIA has done over the years
could have been done directly, and overtly by the Department of
State if the Department of State could have gotten the
appropriations.

For example, support to the National Student Associ-
ation to send delegations to international conferences and
things of that sort, activities similar to the activities of
the British Council in Great Britain. But the chairman of our
Appropriations Subcommittee in the House, Mr. John Rooney,
didn't care very much about things cultural and scientific
exchanges and U.S.I.D. and the Bureau of Cultural Affairs, and
things of that sort, and now here was CIA who was able to come
up with the money and so I think some activities sort of
gravitated towards CIA because Dick Russell got their money
which could have just as well or better been done overtly.

I don't know whether the situation can significantly
change in that respect, but support of things like Radio Liberty
and Radio Free Europe could just as well have been done overtly
by the Department of State as they were attempted on a covert

basis by CIA. A good many things of that sort happened because
they had the money.

MR. BELIN: Secretary Rusk, we also talked about
internal executive oversight about CIA and the role of the
Director of Central Intelligence, the DCI, as the head of the
intelligence community.

Do you have any observations concerning the question
of executive oversight of the Agency, or any suggestions in that
area?

MR. RUSK: Well, as I look back on it, I do have
one specific and potentially important suggestion. CIA by
statute reports to the National Security Council. Of course,
the President is the Chairman, and his decisions in the National
Security Council are the decisions. There is no voting pro-
cedure there. But the statutory members of the National
Security Council, in my recollection, never once sat down and
looked at the major tables and the budget of the CIA. We were
sort of in the intelligence and operational chain of command
in a sense, but not in the administration chain of command.

I would assume that what happened was that the CIA
would take their budget to maybe two or three members of the
Bureau of the Budget, and then it would be discussed briefly
with the President, and then it would be taken down and
discussed with Senator Russell, and that was about the end of
it.

In retrospect, I think it would have been helpful if
the statutory members of the National Security Council had at
least once a year taken a look at the organizational structure
and the manning tables and the budget of CIA in order to have
a little bit better feel of not only what was going on but what
might be going on that they would not normally bump into.

So I think that that would be a step, that would be
an improvement that would be desirable.

MR. BELIN: Now, I want to turn to the area of
possible CIA involvement in coup d'etats abroad. Perhaps it is
not within our charter specifically, but you made a comment
last night concerning your eight years as Secretary of State.

MR. RUSK: Well, I have stated publicly, and I have
been continuing to scratch my mind for exceptions, I have
stated publicly that there was some 82 or so in the world
somewhere during the eight years in which I was Secretary of
State. That is unconstitutional changes of government.

There were substantially larger changes through
elections and things of that sort. I don't remember a single one
of those that was triggered by or caused by the CIA.

MR. BELIN: And by those, you mean coup d'etats?

MR. RUSK: Coup d'etat. The coup d'etat.

Now, I think one thing that requires a rather careful
look, and some rather careful distinctions, the CIA people
consider that one of their jobs is to keep in touch with

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

different elements within a population, and they do have
contacts with dissident groups here and there. Sometimes
people in our embassies, mostly CIA people, but sometimes on
the diplomatic side, get inquiries from dissident groups and
various countries as to what the attitude towards the United
States would be in the event of a coup d'etat.

I tried to get the word established that we would not
respond to any such inquiries, partly as a practical matter,
because I suspected that many of these were from provacateurs
of the governments involved and they were trying to find out
what our answer would be to such a question. But I had no
doubts the CIA was in touch with dissident groups, and may have
at times been buying information from them. But that does not
translate in my mind to their calling the shots of it or
becoming the boss or directing a coup d'etat.

MR. BELIN: In your experience as Secretary of State,
were you aware of the practices of other governments and their
intelligence, both in this country and abroad?

MR. RUSK: Yes. To a very considerable extent.

Of course, you always suspect there are practices that you
haven't caught up with, but there is a mean, dirty, unsavory,
back alley struggle going on in the world in which a good many
governments particpate, some of them close friends of ours,
and most of them, including targets in the United States, because
the position of the United States in world affairs is such that

influencing American policy is a major effort on the part of
almost every foreign office in the world. Wherever a dispute
develops, the parties will each come in to try and get the
United States to take their side, and so we are the target of
a great deal of effort to find out what we are thinking, to
influence our decisions and judgments, and a struggle to
undermine some of the things that we are trying to accomplish
in the world.

MR. BELIN: Were you ever aware, for instance, of
forged documents being used to try and put the blame on the
CIA for things?

MR. RUSK: Well, I think there were two or three
instances that I recall. The exact timing and countries I
don't recall at this point. It is somewhere in the records
where forged documents were planted on African leaders to try
to persuade them that CIA was trying to overthrow them.

Fortunately, these forgeries were so crude that it was very
easy to demonstrate that they were, in fact, forgeries, and I
think we were able to satisfy the local chiefs of state that
CIA was not trying to overthrow them.

But there were all sorts of things. If I could
go off the record for a moment?

(Discussion off the record.)

REPORT ON CUBA'S INTERNAL PROBLEMS WITH REBELS

FR Warsaw: Ministry of Foreing Affairs 10 Oct 63 [M]
TO New York: Polish Mission to the UN Routine
Msg. Nr. 11512

For the Chief of Mission

On 7 October CUIRUS reported from Havana:

Comments on FIDEL's speech of 28 September. Cuba's foreign policy and its
attitude toward the Moscow Treaty are determined by the aggressive activities of
the United States. General relaxation may not be applicable to the Caribbean area.

1. The coups in Honduras and the Dominican Republic, and the rise of
reactionaries in Venezuela, he ties in with coordination of operations against
Cuba by the CIA from Central America.

2. Smuggling of arms to the capitol is on the increase. The underground
is switching to a long-range harassment supported by pirate activities from the
outside. In September the government carried out massive military operations in
the Escambray and Matanza areas.

3. The Cuban counterrevolutionaries and Cubans from Central America
announce heavier underground traffic in men and arms for November and December.

4. I believe that the approaching Presidential elections in the United
States will strengthen reactionary forces from within and without. Immediate US
aggression is out of the question. Therefore, there is a need for a strong gorilla
[sic] collar around Cuba. Simultaneously, the economic blockade is being intensi-
fied. This is dictated by the consequent \"anti-imperialistic lines of our own
foreign policy.\" On the whole, in their opinion, relaxation is due to the peace-
ful policy pursued by the Soviet Union, but they attribute this, first of all, to
their own position.

ROBERT KENNEDY VIEWED AS LEADING CONTENDER TO SUCCEED HIS BROTHER
IN 1964

FR New York: BOSSAY 22 Nov 63
TO Santiago: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 563

Reference my telex Nr. 561((A)).

I should add that succession to the presidence falls to the
Presidency of the Senate and Senator from Texas, Vice President
LYNDON JOHNSON, who will be in office until 20 January 1965.
After the latter, it would fall to the Representative from
Massachusetts and Speaker of the House of Representatives
MACCORMACK.

The press today reported that Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY,
brother of the late President, was in the process of leaving the
post to participate actively in his brother's presidential cam-
paign. In diplomatic circles it is believed that, in the absence
of other Democratic figures of the first rank who could aspire to
the presidency in the November 1964 election, the present Attorney
General becomes, with the death of President KENNEDY, the first
choice to succeed him for the presidential term which will begin
in January 1965.

News has just arrived that at 1438 (Eastern time) LYNDON
JOHNSON took the oath of office as President of the United States
before a federal district judge.

as capitulationist, and as anti-artist-Leninist on the issue of war and peace
as they are on other cardinal issues under dispute which were analyzed
Installmente.
Comment:
Regardless of all other major consideretiors, such current I session,
Paiping's polemiczi machinery grinds inexorably on. The latest item, which
caps a year-long torrent of words against Dhrushcher and the CPSU, conveye
the impression of increasing unreality and of haseling over theological points
which caly would intarest over theologians...
Notwithstanding some characteristically adroit sarcasa addressed at
Khrushchey, the article as a whole is defensive in tese and reveals the diff
of defending Hao's pronouncer sute against the Soviet attech other than by
interpreting and distorting their original sense or by merely relating t
holy writ, as if their very invocation would quail further argscut...

21.	CONTINUED: Flights to North Pole 12 were undertaken earlier than those
to North Pole 10 probably because the airstrip was ready sooner. On 17
October, personnel responsible for directing flights, arrived at Worth Pole
12 aboard LI-2 04205. On 19 October it was reported that the airstrip
Deasured 2952 X 164 feet and was ready to receive a trial flight by an IL-14
in the daytime. On 20 October two IL-li's began resupply operations from
Mys Shmidta and Somnitelnaya. Supply flights to North Pole 10 by LI-2 04205
commenced on 20 October. On 25 October, IL-lis were scheduled to fly there from
Mys Kozisty and Cheluskin. It appears, judging from the usage of cover
numbers, that the drift stations each have two airstrips, and that to date,
all are capable of taking IL-l aircraft.
In September the Soviets reported that preparation of an airstrip at
orth Pole 10 capable of taking heavy aircraft wasto be undertaken. The
is normally taken to mean an A-12
description \"heavy aircraft
type, but it is evident, to mate at least, that no such aircraft has
visited the drift station. During the past 10 days, five PA IL-LAS
have been jerrying supplies to the ice islands at a very higi: rate.
The transports carried fuel, food, instruments and persoanel to worth
Pole 10 from Mys Chelyaskin and to North Pole 12 from K.3 Sumidts. JPA
support of the fall high latitude expedition exceeds that of any previous
expedition. On 18 November the location of the orift stations were:

10 September 1953: During a conversation between SAM Regimental
Headquarters at Santiago de las Vegas and the Siguanea Ari site it was
nd that a new commander for the Siquanca SAM site had arrived from the
Soviet Union. Past in ercepts of SAM communications have indicated
the appointment of new commanders at several Sam sites. In the majority of
these cases the now commanders were previously acting is Chief of staff
at another site. The 10 September 1963 activity, represents the initial
reflection in comint of a new arrival in Cuba being directl. appointed as
the commander of a Soviet SA battalion in Cuba.

at the site that he (the speaker at the site) was going to proceed to the
Nuevitas SAM Site to check out the equipment. This person is believed to be
associated with the SAE Support Facility at Vicotria de Las Tunas and was
probably ning technical checks of equipment at the Camaguey and Nuevitas
SAM Sites prior to the movement of times aites.
Since the Camaguey site was ordered to practice only three hours prior
to the scheduled time of movement of the site the move may be a mobility
exercise rather than abandonment of the site.

SED Communications on 22 Novesbar revealed that press, radio and television
had been advised by the Party Agitation Commission in Berlin to \"take note
of a report which it plicated Fascist circles in the assassination of President
Kennedy.
Further to para. 2 of 2/AGC/C246) regarding the murder of one and possible
two East German Taxi-drivers by Soviet Citizens in Dresden, a Berlin Party
official stated on 22 November that further locel discussions on the matter
were undesirable since\" ((B Percent the Soviets could easily get wind of it))\".
A new Church Law ((Amtszuchtsgesetz)) approval at a recent meeting of the
Hecklenburger Landes Synce ((probably the Synod of the Hecklenburger State
Church)) which ended on 9th November, has caused considerable alarm among
party members, wewe main aim of which is apparently to \"remove\"
clergymen branded as \"progressives\" ((a probable reference to those who voted
in the recent election)), was approved despite the intervention of the Bishop,
who forbade it, and of the party which enlisted at least 15 Clergymen to pos0
strong objections, while the party has branded the low as invalid, because it
is concormed with the whole of Germany whereas there are two separate Germas
states. Full reasons for refutation are to be worked out in detail ister.

13.	SECTION III/8 - Alert in Bestam Kavel District Relaxed, 23 November:
As a result of the death of President Kennedy, the Eastern Naval District
of Cuba was placed on an alert on 20442 ca 22 November by Banes, Headquarters
for that District, At 20372 on 23 November, the alert was relaxed a certain
degree by Banes; instructions were passed to Santiago de Cuba, a subordinate,
to give leave to 25 percent of their personnel. For the 23rd and 4th and that
furtiver orders would be forthcoming on 25 November 1963.
COMENT: The authorisation to grant leave to personnel is an indication that
the alert is somewhat relaxed and the note that further instructions would be
issued on Monday, 25 November indicates that a nenurgent view has been adopted
for the situation by Cuban Naval authorities in the Sastern Naval District.

At 1000 hours that same day Russians were marking out furrows and constructing
new furrows at the Qushvar post.
At 1500 hours on 23 October, a Russian Jeep came down alongside the border
from the Qushvar Post and stopped for a few minutes at Qalich Kallu (repeated as
Malich Kalu), where the Russians have underground rooms, and then it returned.

32.	SEXION III/3 - Alert in Oriente Province Balieved to be Terminated: (see
Iten #13, wal's 25/26 November):
The alert in Oriente Province is believed to be terminated. The alert, ap-
parently prompted by President Kennedy's death on 22 November, was possibly pre-
scheduled to terminate on 1:5 November. There have been two orders which suggest
that the alert was destined to be concluded on 25 November: They ares
1)	Access to the coastal observation post at Punta Maisi (20-15 74-09W) was
restricted until 25 November because of the alert.
2)	Subordinates of Banes, Headquarters Eastern Naval District, were to receive
further orders on the 25th, presumably concerning their alert status; no such orders
have been noted in communications.
There have been no further references in intercepted communications to the
alert since 02222 on 23 November.
It is possible that the restricted access to the observation post at Punta
laisi extends to other observation posts in Orienta Province such as reported on
23 November when First Army Coastal Observation Posts were placed in alert status,
and that the restriction was to be lifted ca 25 November by all those posts.
Further indications that the alert was terminated is the fact that the Cuban
Navy was engaged in an island-wide communications exercice on 25 November. It is
considered unlikely that such an exercise would be conducted under alert conditions,
There have been no further references to the alert status of the (D Percent
Santiago de Cuba) units which was first observed on 23 November. All CRAF and
Soviet Forces Cuba Communications appear to be normal during this period,
22 - 26 November 1963.

confirmation from an ecclessiastical source that two of the three
Protestant missionaries from Cabinda and Quimpendo would soon return
to Canada, while a third would remain in Africa \"awaiting important
events which are expected.\" The Embassy's infermant was told that
these events bear the name of \"revolution.\" The Embassy states
that, while a lack of funds was also mentioned, the principal
reasons for the departure of the missionaries is fear of massacres
in which no white person would escape (3/O/POD/T1419-63). (TOP SECRET

REPORT ON PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S SPEECH BEFORE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

FR Washington: KORTEWEG, 3900 16th St., 17 Dec 63
N.W.
TO The Hague: GEPEDE((A)) --
Msg Nr: --

In a brief address to the United Nations General Assembly
the new President of the United States attempted to make clear
what his future foreign policy will be like. He pointed out
that 30 years ago he was a collaborate of ROOSEVELT in a peaceful
revolution in the United States, and said that he now seeks
something similar for the entire world. His remark that no one
particular political system will dominate the future of mankind
may be taken as an expression of his willingness to accept
peaceful coexistence. Every leader who strives for peace, he
said, will find himself side by side with the United States.
Mr. JOHNSON's speech, which took only 15 minutes, did not
go into details, but in its main outlines left nothing to be
desired so far as clarity is concerned.

The New York police took extensive precautions to insure
the President's safety. The hall was carefully checked, and
even the grounds outside the building were inspected closely.
The President, who was accompanied by his wife and 11 members
of the Congress, was welcomed by Secretary General U THANT.
It was the last day the General Assembly, and most of the
delegates were about to return home, but the large hall was
filled to capacity. All seats in the public gallery were
occupied by special invitation.

Netherlands 3/O/NED/T12-63

Mr. JOHNSON said that the late President had inspired humanity
with fresh hope, which he shared with a new generation of world
leaders. KENNEDY had addressed himself to the future, and
wanted to forget the disunity of the past. The world should
follow his example.

It is true that the world knows more about how to destroy
itself than how to live together in understanding, but the
United Nations has been too successful for one to despair of the
future. President JOHNSON pointed to successes in the Congo
and Middle East, to the slowing of the arms race, to the progress
of decolonization, to the furthering of human rights. The
United Nations should provide opportunities for constructive
action and not become a platform for name-calling.

The President does not desire only bilateral assistance to
underdeveloped countries, but lays great stress on collective
international action. Just as he wishes to create the impression
among Americans that he is liberal and progressive, so did he
take this opportunity to convince the Assembly that he is deeply
interested in the fight against illiteracy, poverty, and disease.
Just as 30 years ago under ROOSEVELT he helped eliminate poverty
in America, so does he now wish to contribute to the elimination
of misery throughout the world.

Above all else, however, he sees his task as the maintenance
of peace. Thanks to KENNEDY, the world has become a little
safer and the road to the future a little easier. The greatest
tribute one can pay to President KENNEDY is to continue his work
for a peaceful future. On this note the new President ended his
brief, reassuring speech.

ALERT IN EASTERN NAVAL DISTRICT RELAXED, 23 NOVEMBER

As a result of the death of President KENNEDY, the Eastern
Naval District of Cuba was placed on an alert at 2044Z on
22 November by Banes, headquarters for that district.((A))

At 2037Z on 23 November, the alert was relaxed a certain
degree by Banes; instructions were passed to Santiago de Cuba,
a subordinate, to give leave to 25 percent of their personnel
for the 23rd and 24th and that further orders would be forthcoming
on 25 November 1963.

COMMENT: The authorization to grant leave to personnel is an
indication that the alert is somewhat relaxed and
the note that further instructions would be issued on
Monday, 25 November indicates that a nonurgent view
has been adopted for the situation by Cuban Naval
authorities in the Eastern Naval District.

Reference your Nr. 25118((A)).

Since the Austrian Foreign Ministry has as yet no reliable
information on the procedure to be followed by the small European
countries, with the exception of the Netherlands, it has not yet
been decided whether Austria will send a government delegation.
Please let us know immediately whether your Embassy has acquired
any information about the intentions of the Scandinavian countries,
Finland, and Switzerland. According to information here, Sweden and
Norway intend only to appoint their ambassadors to Washingtion as
special ambassadors, but have not yet come to any decision, since it
is said that the Danish Prime Minister intends to go to Washington.
It is said that the the Swiss do not even intend to appoint their
Ambassador to Washington as special ambassador.

EGYPTIAN REACTION TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S MURDER

FR Cairo: -- 23 Nov 63
TO Rome: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 649

Signed: MAGISTRATI.

Also in Cairo the murder of President KENNEDY has made a
very deep impression.

President NASSER sent the widow a moving and significant
telegram. Actually, and especially very recently, KENNEDY
appeared, particularly as far as Egypt is concerned, a strong
defender of the necessity of the continuation of American economic
aid in favor of Egypt and this was in spite of the active
anti-Nasserian campaign (8G) by the Senate majority in Washington.

Concerning the attitude of the press and concerning
responsibility for the murder, the position (B val is) still
(B val uncertain) but there is no lack of [5M/G] comments
tending to indicate that KENNEDY was murdered (B val mainly)
for the cause of racial equality and for his actions in favor
of the colored people.

19002, 23 November 1963, unless otherwise stated.

SIGINT DAILY SUMMARY - PART ONE

WORLD HIGHLIGHTS

1. CUBAN MILITARY UNITS PUT ON ALERT BECAUSE OF THE DEATH
OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

At 2043Z 22 Nov 63 the message \"a state of alert is ordered
for all personnel. Be ready to repel aggression.\" (2/LR1/CUN/
R11-63). U/I military units were alerted at 2320Z on VHF voice
communications which normally link First Army Hq, Santiago with
Guantanamo City with the following message \"Inform the Chief that
by orders of 117 (unit commander) here, all of them, all of the
points, were put on alert. (2LR1/CUM/R187-63).

At 2031Z, 22 November, Eastern Naval Headquarters Banes
instructed Headquarters, Southern Sector, Santiago to recall all
units. A later message from Banes to Naval Headquarters, Havana
reported all units have been recalled due to the death of President
KENNEDY. (2/QS/CUN/R665-63)。

Operator chatter indicated that the death of President
KENNEDY had been announced in Cuba. One Cuban operator remarked
\"There will be some happy people here.\"

Other special instructions from the Cuban Government
included:

1) A circular message dated 23 November apparently sent
to all the Cuban Diplomatic Missions, in which the Cuban Foreign
Ministry instructed the missions to make no statements. (3/0/CUD/
T1380-63). 2) The Cuban Government ordered the Havana-UN link
to stay open all night an unprecedented move, and 3) The Cuban
UN ambassador was asked by Foreign Minister ROA to forward
immediately all possible data concerning President JOHNSON. He was
told to look in Who's Who and was also informed that Prensa Latina
had biographical data of this type. (3/0/CUD/T1381-63, 3/0/CUD/
T1382-63). (TOP SECRET DINAR)

FR Havana: Chilean Embassy 23 Nov 63
TO Santiago: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 130

The reaction in Havana to the assassination of President
KENNEDY has been calm but cautious. Only isolated Communist
groups have shown any rejoicing. The radio and news reels
are reporting objectively and in a correct manner, without
showing regret (2 gr G) statement by the government. The
newspapers are printing today the statements of the Cuban
Ambassador to the United Nations.

((A)) Circles were seriously concerned over the reper-
cussions which the assassination of the President of the
United States may have.

((A)) Obviius omission.

For the Foreign Minister.

Real shock exists over the assassination of President
KENNEDY. Television, via Telstar, is showing touching
demonstrations in Europe.

The Chiefs of State from many countries will attend the
funeral services.

It is my personal opinion that your attendance would be
advisable in view of the fact that the new martyr to human
rights was a great friend of Bolivia and was convinced of the
grandeur and hopes of the national revolution.

Pursuant to my preceding telegram((A)).

The President's death was given official notice only by the
lowering of a black flag to half-staff at the government head-
quarters and by the visit of a deputy minister of Foreign Affairs
and an assistant deputy trade minister to my American colleague.
The people remain dismayed, but their anxiety of the first few
hours seems to have died. The press, on the other hand, did
not deviate from its harsh custom of anti-American manifestation
and sought, with a touch of irritability, to reject any
sugggestion of Communist implication in the attempt.

PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION A ZIONIST CONSPIRACY

FR Doha: 25 Nov 63
TO New York: Mr. AHMAD AL-SHOKAIRI,
c/o Mr. U THANT
Msg Nr:

The assassination of the great President KENNEDY was a shock
to Palestinians. Please convey our sincere sympathy to the KENNEDY
family and to the people of the United States.

Behind the mysterious crime is a carefully plotted Zionist
conspiracy. Review of the secret and overt Zionist criminal conspira-
cies against Lord MOWEEN BERNANDOTTE, the Egyptian and German
scientists, as well as the terrorist method adopted in kidnaping
EICHMAN and many others, provides the evidence to question the
position of their secret organizations. The late President was likely
to win the coming presidency elections without supplicating the
Zionist sympathy or seeking the Jews votes. Aware of the fact that
their influence and power in the United States are based upon the
Jews votes, the Zionists murdered the courageous President who was
about to destroy that legend of theirs. His assassination is a warning
to the rest of the honorable leaders.

Reveal their conspiracy to the supreme judgement of the world.
Be careful, you are the hope of the Palestinians.

CASTRO MAKES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

FR Havana: Foreign Ministry 25 Nov 63
TO Accra: Cuban Embassy((A)) --
Msg Nr: 7468

At a special appearance on 23 November, FIDEL stated:

We do not hate men, we hate systems. The death of a man,
although he is our enemy, cannot cheer us. Always in the presence
of death we cease our belligerence and we bow with respect al-
though it is in respect to an enemy.

KENNEDY was strongly attacked for being bellicose. Ultra-
reactionaries are the only ones that can be called beneficiaries
of these events. Advantage is taken of the assassination to re-
lease in the USA anti-Soviet and anti-Cuban hysteria and they are

HUNGARIAN REACTION TO NEWS OF ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

FR Budapest: VILARULLO 25 Nov 63
TO Buenos Aires: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 67

The Hungarian press, television, and radio reported fully the
assassination of President KENNEDY, attributing it to fascist elements
and inspired by racial hatred. Despite the fact that [1 gr G]
emphasizes the grief and distress of all Hungary, none of the principal
government figures visited the United States Legation to present
personnel condolences and the text of the [1 gr G] telegram sent by
President DOBI was not published. Moreover, the Hungarian funeral
delegation, along with those from Romania and Czechoslovakia, was
of the lowest rank of the countries of this area, acting Foreign
Minister PETER MOD.

Finally while the government officials expressed restrained
grief, the people in general were deeply touched.

BRAZILIAN AMBASSADOR ASSESSES JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION

FR Washington: Brazilian Embassy 26 Nov 63
TO Rio de Janeiro: Foreign Ministry Urgent
Msg Nr: 825

[2-part message complete]

Nr. 825.
Confidential.

The personality and political background of President LYNDON
B. JOHNSON, as well as the circumstances which brought him to
power, seem to indicate that American foreign and domestic
policies, under the new Administration, will probably adhere to
the following basic directives:

1. In the short run, as a natural result of the momentum
of a strong Administration, such as that of President KENNEDY, no
profound changes are expected, especially in the field of foreign
policy (President JOHNSON has already stated that he will follow
the foreign policy of President KENNEDY);

2. In the longer run, however, one can foresee:

A) In the field of foreign policy, with the pre-
dominance of the State Department over the White House \"staff\"((A))
(which reflected the strong personality of President KENNEDY and
his marked interest in international policy), there probably
will be:

I) No substantial change from the KENNEDY line
in relations with the Soviet Union; the new Administration will
tend toward a wait-and-see attitude;

II). In the field of relations with Western
Europe, or more precisely with France, a less rigid attitude
and one of greater acceptance of the French position, with the
objective of maintaining a united Western front vis-à-vis the
possibility of a political offensive by the Kremlin;

III). In relations with Latin America, the inter-
view which President JOHNSON will have this afternoon with the
Foreign Minister will certainly be more enlightening than any
prediction made at this time;

B) In the field of domestic policy, there will possibly
be an improvement in relations between the Executive and the
Legislative within the line of \"compromise\" ((A)); the new Presi-
dent, much more the conservative than the innovator, with intimate
connections with the Congress, and a Southerner, will have more
facility in [gaining] approval of the big bills (\"civil rights,\"
\"fiscal reform,\" \"medical aid,\" \"aid to the aged,\" etc.) precisely
because he will accept more conservative formulas of compromise;
the new Administration will also tend to be more conservative with
regard to government intervention in the economy; however, radical
changes cannot be expected, since JOHNSON will also face the
pressure of the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party, and
any more pronounced split within the Party would be fatal to the
hopes for victory in next year's election.

ALERT IN ORIENTE PROVINCE BELIEVED TO BE TERMINATED

The alert in Oriente Province (see 2/0/CUN/R196-63) is be-
lieved to be terminated. The alert, apparently prompted by
President KENNEDY's death on 22 November, was possibly pre-
scheduled to terminate on 25 November. There have been two orders
which suggest that the alert was destined to be concluded on
25 November; they are:

1) Access to the Coastal Observation Post at Punta
Maisi (20-15N 74-09W) was restricted until 25 November because
of the alert (see 2/QS/CUN/R667-63); and

2) Subordinates of Banes, Headquarters Eastern Naval
District, were to receive further orders on the 25th, presumably
concerning their alert status (2/0/CUN/R196-63); no such orders
have been noted in communications.

There have been no further references in intercepted communi-
cations to the alert since 02222 on 23 November (2/QS/CUN/R667-63).

It is possible that the restricted access to the Observation
Post at Punta Maisi extends to other Observation Posts in Oriente
Province such as reported on 23 November when First Army Coastal.
Observation Posts were placed in an alert status
(2/LR1/CUM/R188-63), and that the restriction was to be lifted on
25 November by all those posts.

Further indication that the alert has terminated is the fact
that the Cuban Navy was engaged in an island-wide communications
exercise on 25 November. It is considered unlikely that such an
exercise would be conducted under alert conditions.

There have been no further references to the alert status
of the (D percent Santiago de Cuba) units which was first ob-
served on 23 November (2/SL/CUA/R05-63). All CRAF and Soviet
Forces Cuba communications appear to be normal during this
period, 22-26 November 1963.

UN REACTIONS TO KENNEDY'S DEATH

FR New York: Polish Mission to the UN 22 Νον 63 1900
TO Warsaw: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Urgent
Msg. Nr. 482

For RAPACKI

First reactions in the UN after KENNEDY's assassination:

1. A unanimous opinion exists that even in the most favorable cir-
cumstances, East-West relations will deteriorate in the next few months and
may last until elections. KENNEDY's assassination will deepen the break in
the Democratic Party between the North and the South. JOHNSON, weak and subject
to influence, will be forced to concentrate on stopping this process. GOLD-
WATER's position will decline which will increase ROCKEFELLER's chances for the
nomination. The results of the elections for the most part will depend on
the popularity of the Democratic candidates. Being mentioned are HUMPHREY,
ROBERT [25-50M] and American journalists in talks emphasize JOHNSON's liberal
past (it is said that he was ROOSEVELT's favorite), and his moderate position
in critical periods during KENNEDY's term.

3. It is alarming that anti-Communist hysteria has been turned on.
Radio and television continue to broadcast unconfirmed reports that held as a
suspect in the assassination is a man who it is said asked for Soviet citizen-
ship two years ago, has a Russian wife and who recently was an activist in the
(Fair Play for Cuba) pro CASTRO organization.

American extremists having great influences in the propaganda
apparatus here want at all costs to be divorced from responsibilities for
the attempt.

REPORT FROM WASHINGTON IN IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF PRESIDENT'S
DEATH

FR Washington: KORTEWEG, 3900 16th St., 26 Nov 63
NW --
TO The Hague: GEPEDE((A))
Msg Nr: --

Prince BERNHARD left Washington on Monday evening, since
he had to be back in the Netherlands early Tuesday without fail.
Before leaving, he was able to see Mrs. KENNEDY, who received
all the distinguished guests in the White House after the funeral.
The Prince was treated with especial courtesy by the Chief of
Staff of the Air Force General LEMAY, who called in person at the
Embassy to take him to the airport, where he made a plane available
to fly him direct to Zolsterberg.

Princess BEATRIX, after visiting the White House, attended
the reception at the State Department, where she spoke at some
length with Mrs. JOHNSON, who was seated between the Dutch
Princess and Queen FREDERIKA of Greece.

Mr. LUNS left at about 1300 on Tuesday. We had a brief
talk with him that morning. He believes that RUSK will now come
more to the fore, because of JOHNSON's previous preoccupation
with domestic politics. He considers it a favorable omen that
the new President recently spent three days in Holland. LUNS
assumes that there will be no abrupt change in American policy,
but one must be prepared to note nuances. Officially, JOHNSON
has always conformed to KENNEDY's policies, but he has always
been a few degrees more conservative, and it remains to be seen
how much of his earlier outlook will carry over.

The White House atmosphere will undoubtedly change, for it is
hard to believe that personal collaborators of KENNEDY such as
BUNDY and SCHLESINGER will be on the JOHNSON team. The influence
of ROSTOW, the planning head in the State Department, could decline,
as will, of course, that of ROBERT KENNEDY.

At the Monday evening reception in the State Department,
JOHNSON had a cordially interested greeting for each guest.
He had a two-handed handshake for LUNS, who was a accompanied by
the Princess and VAN ROIJEN. The former received hearty applause
from the crowd when she left the building.

Americans are deeply appreciative of DE GAULLE's coming
to Washington, but LUNS has not got the impression that there
will be a change in the American attitude toward France.

At the reception, LUNS had rather long conversations with
ERHARD and Indonesian Defense Minister NASUTION, with which he
was very satisfied. ERHARD had just visited Paris, and it can
easily be guessed what he and LUNS talked about.

LUNS will remain Wednesday in New York. He will arrive in
Amsterdam on Thursday morning and go direct to Strassburg, where
the European Parliament seems quite anxious that he speak as
soon as possible.

On Tuesday, RUSK had talks with several important visitors,
including MIKOYAN, ERHARD, and HOME. He also received a group
of Latin American representatives. In all these talks the
President ((B)) assured his guests that American policy toward
their countries would not change.

On the same day, many people visited President KENNEDY's
grave across the river. Queen FREDERIKA laid an olive wreath
as a symbol of peace.

On Wednesday, President JOHNSON will deliver to the
Congress a speech which is awaited with interest. However, it

does not seem likely that he will hold a press conference this
week, since Thursday is Thanksgiving Day. This was originally
a festival of thanks for the harvest, and later became a day of
general thanksgiving. This year it will be an unprecedentedly
somber day for America. What one can be thankful for at this
moment is that political institutions provide for a quick and
peaceful take-over in the event of the sudden death of the

The [Bulgarian] Government presented official condolences
to the United States Government on the assassination of
President KENNEDY. The Minister of Foreign Affairs visited the
United States Minister for the same purpose.

The people received the news with surprise and regret.
The local television station repeated via Moscow the burial
services in the United States. The press of this country
eulogized the personality of the late President as a supporter
of peace, attributing his death to an ultrarightist group.

All the diplomatic missions flew their flags at half-
mast -- the Soviets with black crape -- with the exception of
Communist China. Religious services held in Sofia were
attended by representatives of all the diplomatic missions.

With reference to your enciphered telegram Nr. 52135((A)),

6 November 1963, I report that I presented a second plea in

that his sentence was pronounced.

The plea was submitted by Dr. RAUL ROA, Cuban Foreign
Minister, to President DORTICOS, who told Dr. ROA to inform me
that on that same day he [ESCALES] had been executed, before
Cuba knew about Mexico's note. In any event, the sentence of
capital punishment would not have been commuted, because he was
one of the principal persons responsible for an attempt against
the life of the Prime Minister, Dr. FIDEL CASTRO.

PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S DEATH NEW BASIS FOR ANTI-ZIONISM IN SYRIA

FR Cairo: -- 27 Nov 63

Msg Nr: --

Signed: MAGISTRATI.

It was not difficult to foresee that the dramatic murder
of the American President with all of (3G) new complications
would have repercussions also in the usual polemic between the
Arabs and Zionism.

In fact, the circumstance that the killer of OSWALD is
of Hebrew-Polish origin has now caused a notable part of the
Cairo press to move in the (5G) that Zionism (13G/M) to this
whole tragedy. Naturally, there are no explanations of motives
and circumstances but this subject (B val also) is, in the eyes
of some of the Arab extremists, useful in muddying the waters
and once again directing accusations against Hebrew organizations.

CUBA'S REACTION TO KENNEDY'S MURDER

FR Warsaw: Ministry of Foreign Affairs 27 Nov 63 0710
TO New York: Polish Mission to the UN Routine
Msg. Nr. 13376

For the Chief of Mission.

On 24 November CIURUS reported from Havana:

1. All information connected with the assassination is being studied
in detail by the local leadership. They believe the present situation to be
very serious. Their presumption was confirmed by the direction taken by the
search for KENNEDY's murderers, that is among Castroites, Communists and USSR
influence. They are concerned with the anti-Cuban and anti-Soviet past which
will exert a substantial influence on the foreign and domestic policy of the
USA. This will be possible because there is a lack of a head of government
with the authority and modernistic leanings which KENNEDY represented.

2. Ultrareactionary circles in the USA, the Pentagon and the (B val C)
IA considered KENNEDY's policy too weak and conciliatory and its continuation
as dangerous to them. It is believed here that the assassination may be
connected with the partially controversial position of KENNEDY and that it
actually could have been planned or committed by these circles. The fact of
the assassination was immediately used by them to increase positive influences
on the Department of State and to turn world opinion away from the real
culprits and intention.

3. The assassination is being used to strengthen conservative circles
throughout Latin America. They fear that an adventurous decision will be
made with regards to Venezuela.

4. Immediately after the first information was received on 22 November,
a quiet military alert was declared in Cuba. They will begin the legal draft
of recruits on 25 November. Military units are being relocated.

5. FIDEL's speech (see the plainlanguage message of 24 November) was
received with gravity and it was in accord with the political thought of the
more mature circles. An immediate political evaluation of the existing and
growing situation especially around Cuba was needed.

PORTUGUESE COMMENT ON CASTRO'S REACTION TO DEATH OF KENNEDY

FR Havana: [M] 27 Nov 63
TO Lisbon: Foreign Ministry
Msg Nr: 17

Late Friday afternoon and through the night a large movement
of troops began here. They were sent to take up positions
and reinforce strategic positions around Havana and the northern
coast of the island because of the assassination of President
KENNEDY. Saturday evening FIDEL CASTRO appeared on television
and spoke about the death of KENNEDY and tried to refute charges
which had already appeared in the United States that the assassin
was a Marxist and a Communist Castroite. Although it was only
the third time that I had witnessed a speech by FIDEL, I got the
immediate impression that on this occasion he was frightened, if
not terrified. Other chiefs of mission, however, confirmed that
impression and indicated surprise at this hasty jump into
the arena to denouce insinuations which were merely from
news and nongovernmental agencies. In fact, it is the general
opinion in diplomatic circles that CASTRO feared that the
assassination would be the spring which would unleash passions
and violent and blind hysteria of the American people against
Cuba and Russia and provide the excuse which up to now was
lacking to justify internationally an invasion of Cuba. There
is talk again about the coincidence of rumors concerning a
crisis at the end of the year (my letter Nr. 224).

FIDEL, emotional and uneasy, tried through the same
telegrams of the American news agencies to refute the accusa-
tions which were then appearing and to twist them so that the
assassination would appear as the work of the Ultra Reaction,
of the extreme racists of the Pentagon,, who are fanatical
supporters of war against Cuba and the Soviet Union.

He (B val sketched) the life of LEE OSWALD and showed
with these telegrams that after his trip to Russia OSWALD
seemed to be supported by forces of the Right and that even
counterrevolutionary circles suspected that he was an agent
of the CIAcor the FBI. This caused CASTRO to wonder whether
the assassin was not the mere instrument of a monstrous plot
of American militarists who, by eliminating KENNEDY, would
put JOHNSON in a postion from which there would be only one
way out: to drain off anti-Cuba hysteria by an action of
declared war.
:

Be that as it may, CASTRO tried to bring forward any
possible formal accusations against Cuba, clamoring that all
people should demand that the death of KENNEDY should be
clarified and harping on the theme that: KENNEDY was being
ferociously attacked because of his weak policy against Cuba
and Russia and therefore, his death could not be the work
of Leftists, since it would only benefit the intentions of the
Ultra Reaction and the Rightists.

I must inform you that the assassination did not cause
a great deal of consternation in counter revolutionary circles
in the interior, disillusioned as they were with the
\"weakness\" of KENNEDY, especially after his speech in Miami,
from which they expected measures or decisions to intervene
in Cuba which would presage the forthcoming end of the
Communist regime of FIDEL CASTRO.

CUBAN AUTHORITIES STATE VIEWS CONCERNING DEATH OF KENNEDY

FR Havana: BASTIAN 27 Nov 63
TO Rio de Janeiro: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 290

Confidential.

Soon after the death of KENNEDY several authorities and persons
associated with the Cuban Government openly expressed to me their
concern relative to the consequences in regard to Cuba and were
unanimous in believing that any other president would be \"even
worse.\" Another concern of the Cubans was expounded in the
unexpected speech by FIDEL CASTRO on Saturday when he accused the
news agencies of trying to connect the Soviet Union and Cuba to
the crime and asserted that the reactionaries of the United States
are trying to create \"a state of anti-Soviet and anti-Cuban
hysteria.\" Further, yesterday the Foreign Ministry in an official
communique confirmed that the indicated assassin tried to obtain
a visa to Cuba without success and repeated that reactionary sectors
tried, in that way, to involve beforehand Cuba and the Soviet Union
in the events and are trying now to cover up the masterminds and
real motives for the crime. There was no official announcement
here of sorrow for the death of the President of the United States.

FIDEL stated, \"Events are demonstrating the sinister plot

OSWALD was made the culprit by the police or was prepared to
commit the act with promise of escape, and was assigned activities
so as to have responsibility fall on or be insinuated against
those whom the perpetrators wished. It is clear that United
States reactionaries tried to make Cuba and the world the victims
of their criminal designs, even at the price of assasinating
their own president. They sent OSWALD to Mexico to request
a transit visa to Cuba for later travel to the USSR. Imagine

MEXICAN AMBASSADOR REPORTS SOVIET REACTION TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S
ASSASSINATION

FR Moscow: LUCIO 29 Nov 63
TO Mexico City: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 201

In reference to the repercussions in the Soviet Union to
the assassination of President KENNEDY.

Basing the first on personal judgment and the rest on infor-
mation from reliable diplomatic sources, I will discuss the following
evaluations:

The deep grief produced here by the above-mentioned assassina-
tion was absolutely spontaneous and due to the high culture of
the Soviet people which enables them (1 gr G) rise above world
actions as well as to the traditional Russian sentimentality.

As soon as the news was known, and in the face of possible
international complications, the military authorities intensified
security measures which have now returned to normal.

High Soviet officials are preoccupied with the stand the
new President of the United States may take on everything regarding
Cuba, and, although MIKOYAN seemed to have been (B val impressed)
after speaking with the President and other high-ranking United States
officials, they are moderately calm. Soviet leaders will wait
to learn how the matters of the purchase of wheat will be settled
in the United States as well as the reaching new U.S.-Soviet cultural
agreement, for the purpose of gaining a clearer idea of the policy
in question.

TEXT OF CUBAN LETTER OF PROTEST TO MEXICO

FR Havana: ROA 29 Nov 63
TO New York: Cuban Mission to the UN --
Msg Nr: 7549

The following transcription is the text of the note presented
on Tuesday night to the Mexican Embassy for the maltreatment of
the employee of the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City, SILVIA DURAN,
in relation to the request for a transit visa made by LEE HARVEY
OSWALD.

Regards,

I have the honor of addressing myself to Your Excellency
in order to expound the following:

Our embassy in the Republic of Mexico has informed this
Ministry that the employee of our consulate in Mexico City,
Mrs. SILVIA DURAN, of Mexican nationality, was detained by
agents of the Federal Police of your country, and also her
husband, on the night of Saturday, 23 November, and that,
furthermore, her home was violated, a search having been made
of it. She was kept in prison until approximately midnight
and during her detention she was submitted to a violent and
coercive interrogation in relation to the request for a transit
visa made to our consulate in the month of September by
the United States citizen, LEE HARVEY OSWALD, accused of the
assassination of President KENNEDY.

Mrs. SILVIA DURAN told the aforesaid agents all she knew,
adhering strictly to the truth; in spite of which she was the
object of censurable treatment, going as for as to make
despicable insinuations and asking her about supposed personal

relations, even intimate, with Mr. OSWALD. Furthermore, she was
physically mistreated by the agents of the Federal Police of
your country; as a consequence of which, she bears bruises on
her arms.

The Revolutionary Government feels that the gross, illegal
and unjustifiable manner in which the police arrested and
maltreated Mrs. DURAN corresponds to the plan of the reactionaries
that, in the United States, planned the assassination of KENNEDY
to promote a policy of retrogression and was continued on
infamous accusations against Cuba and other countries.

The gravity implicated by the conduct of the aforementioned
police agents cannot be dismissed by the Government of Cuba,
which considers this act a flagrant complicity of the members
of the Mexican Police with those who treacherously tried to
involve our country in the filthy crime.

The dispicabilities, coercious and physical aggressions
of which an employee of our consulate in Mexico City has been
the victim, constitute not only a criminal act which challenges
the judicial authorities of your country, but also the ignoring of
the minimal guarantees to which are accredited all the officials
and employees of a consular office. The transpired events are,
besides, totally unfriendly toward Cuba.

Therefore, the Revolutionary Government of Cuba feels
itself in the right and with the duty of presenting before
the Government of the United States of Mexico this protest
and stating to your illustrous government that the perpetration
of these acts damage the friendly relations between both
Governments, the maintenances of which have been of profound
and demonstrated interest to the people and the Revolutionary
Government of Cuba.

I take this opportunity to reiterate to Your Excellency
my highest esteem.

POLISH REACTIONS TO KENNEDY'S DEATH

FR New York: Polish Mission to the UN  23 Νοv 63 1100
TO Warsaw: Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Urgent
Msg. Nr. 486

For WINIEWICZ

Our Nr. 482ª point 3. Everything points to the continuation of the internal
struggle [B val based) on the political interpretation of KENNEDY's assassi-
nation. Immediately after the attempt, the initial commentaries linked it
with the racist movement, which assumed the offensive by rallying themselves
around the efforts of the Texas police in order to saddle OSWALD, a reputed pro
CASTRO activist who two years ago wanted to remain in the USSR, with the
responsibility for the attempt. The arrest of Cubans was begun in Dallas.
GOLDWATER, who yesterday refused to comment on the assassination, joined the
campaign. Radio and television suspended all their programs and - with minor
exceptions which included ABC directed among others by the former EISENHOWER
press agent HAGHERTY taking advantage of this background to bring about anti-
communist hysteria. The fact that Saturday through Monday are days free of
work facilitates reaching the community.

Today's declaration by JOHNSON and the Department of State denying the
existence of reputed facts of a conspiracy against KENNEDY's life involving
the USSR and Cuba has as its aim the restraint of the campaign of extreme
racists, which can create difficulty in overcoming the internal situation and
could paralyze the foreign policy of Washington.

Probably in reply to these declarations circulated among the American
press (among others in the UN) is the theme that the KENNEDY murder could have
been inspired by those centers in the USSR which do not want a detente. This
theme is also being linked with the attempt to arrest BARGHOORN, the downing

It is anticipated that immediately after the funeral personal intrigue will
begin. Speculation of RUSK's resignation are being repeated (possible succes-
sors, FULBRIGHT or HARRIMAN if JOHNSON is determined to continue the present
relations with the USSR and BUNDY or perhaps someone comparable but thus far
an unknown politician if he decides to lead the Democratic party to the
elections on a wave of hardfast foreign policy).

MEXICAN AMBASSADOR REPORTS SOVIET REACTION TO ASSASSINATION OF
U.S. PRESIDENT

FR Moscow: LUCIO 29 Nov 63
TO Mexico City: Foreign Ministry -
Msg Nr: 201

Reference repercussions in the Soviet Union to the assassination
of President KENNEDY.

Basing the first on personal judgment and the others on reports
from reliable diplomatic sources, I will give the following evalua-
tions:

The deep grief produced here by the assassination was
absolutely spontaneous and can be explained by the high culture of
the Soviet people, which enables them to rise above world events,
and by traditional Russian sentimentality.

The moment the news was received, because of the possibility of
international complications the military authorities increased their
security measures. These have now returned to normal.

High-ranking Soviet officials are concerned over what interna-
tional policy the new President will pursue, especially with respect
to Cuba, and, although it seems that MIKOYAN's feelings, after
speaking with the President and other high-ranking United States
officials, were moderately calm, Soviet leaders are waiting to learn
how the matter of the purchase of wheat in the United States will be
resolved and also for the conclusion of a new Soviet-United States
cultural agreement, in order to obtain a more clear idea of the above-
mentioned policy.

DISCUSSION OF KENNEDY'S DEATH AND ITS IMPACT ON US POLICY

FR New York: Polish Mission to the UN 25 Nov 63 1930

Msg. Nr. 488

For WINIEWICZ

Our Nr. 486.a

1. The statement by the Texas state authorities that the slaying of
OSWALD closes the investigation of the KENNEDY assassination brought on public
reactions of doubt by some segments of the information media (commentators and
journalists) of the intentions of the Dallas police who conducted the investi-
gation. This in turn facilitated the decision of the federal authorities to
step into the investigation immediately. R. KENNEDY's hand can also be seen
in this. Therefore, a struggle between the right and groups close to KENNEDY
will continue over the political implications of the attempt. It must be
expected that in the near future it will pass to more basic matters of foreign
and internal policies of the new president. Although the right was not success-
ful, so far, in obtaining a high degree of anti-communist tension in the
community, and force, in this way, JOHNSON to immediately withdraw from
KENNEDY's line, undoubtedly the reaction expanded its influences. Its repre-
sentatives in Congress, HICKENLOOPER. for example, began an open attack against
KENNEDY's policy of seeking agreements with the Soviet Union, emphasizing with
this the hope that JOHNSON will not be such an \"inexperienced\" politician.

2. In the UN great importance is attached to JOHNSON's talks with
MIKOYAN, DE GAULLE and ERHARD (the level and number of the FRG delegation
attached special attention). The Western delegations of Europeans and Scandi-
navians, with whom we talked, avoided any speculation whatsoever as to the
result of the talks.

sent a high-level delegation (the remaining countries of the People's Democ-

I. KENNEDY's murder and its causes.

A. Since the announcement of the assassination, there
have been rumors in diplomatic circles, and in some of the newspapers
and radio broadcasts and various other quarters about the facts and
motives of the event and the position of the Dallas authorities
toward it, etc.

Some are of the opinion that the crime was arranged
by some radical right-wingers who had been aroused by KENNEDY's
policy which advocated racial equality, by his position toward some
of the big industrial forces, particularly steel, and by his
strategy which (Part 2) called for a truce with the Soviets and
for finding spheres of co-operation with them. Others believe that
the crime was set up by the radical Communists who oppose the policy
of peaceful coexistence. One faction of that (group) said that the
crime was an individual act committed by a fanatic or a deranged
person.

B. The killing of OSWALD, who was accused of KENNEDY'S
murder, and the circumstances under which it was committed and the
new suspicions it raised in and outside of America [1 wd G]
President JOHNSON (B val to instruct) the (Part 3] FBI and the
Department of Justice to make a comprehensive investigation of the
matter and not to be content with the investigations which were
being made by the state in which the crime was committed. It was

also reported today that the Senate Judiciary Committee would in
turn request an investigation of the matter and also discussion of
legislation to make the murder of a President a federal crime
which would not fall under the legal jurisdiction of any state.

C. It is hoped that the coming investigations will reveal
the following: [Part 4]

Was OSWALD the killer and what were his motives? If
OSWALD was not the killer, who committed the crime? Was it a
conspiracy or an individual act? Was it an American or an inter-
national conspiracy?

The prevailing view among circles known for conser-
vatism is that it is essential to make a meticulous and public
investigation to forestall rumors and in order to dispel unjustified
suspicions, elevate the power of the law and protect American honor
in the eyes of the world and history.

II. The new President and his policy: (Part 5]

The leaders of Congress from both parties and the top officials
in the government and the press and radio worked energetically
to prevent division and confusion((A)) life to normal, after it had
almost come to a standstill, by supporting the new President and
advocating unity and working for the future. In order to restore
confidence and clarify matters, the President hastened to announce
his domestic and foreign policy in a speech which he delivered to
Congress in joint session, with the chiefs of the diplomatic
missions and representatives of the international and American press
also present. (Part 6)

He announced that his foreign and domestic policy would be a
continuation and implementation of the policy of his predecessor:

A. From the international standpoint, he stated that he
supported the policy of seeking peace and exploring spheres of
co-operation, even with antagonists, offering aid to emerging
nations, bolstering the Western alliance and fulfilling America's
obligations from South Viet Nam to Berlin. HE summarized his foreign

policy by saying that America would be ready for peace or war.

B. From the domestic standpoint, he also adhered to
KENNEDY's program and urged (Part 7) Congress to hasten to enact
the racial equality bill, the tax reduction bill, the education law,
etc.
i
This speech is the first official document which, at least on
the surface, reveals that the new President will adhere to KENNEDY's
foreign and domestic policy. The view which is current in some
Western diplomatic circles is that the new President is an expert
in the methods and the directing of American partisan policy and
that he was extraordinary in his handling of the various currents
in Congress; however, (Part 8) he has not been sufficiently exper-
ienced in foreign affairs and he leans more toward the conservatives
than the liberals. Some of these circles have also stated some
apprehensions about him and have said that he is from the re-
calcitrant, conservative South and that his connection with the
oilmen in Texas is well known and that his long service in the Armed
Forces Committee in the Senate has made him closely connected with
the top men of the armed forces, and these persons do not like
KENNEDY's policy which advocated trying to reach an understanding
with the Russians. Then, his friendship with the American Ambassador
in Bonn, [Part 9] Mr. MCGHEE, who leans toward ADENAUER's views on
Moscow, might make him more inclined toward a policy of toughness,
not truce, with regard to the Communist camp.

Some Britons think it possible that KHRUSHCHEV will have no
confidence in him and that DE GAULLE may seize the opportunity to
activate his plans in Europe. They, therefore, advocate that
Britain take the initiative in playing a more prominent role in the
Western camp in the directing of international policy.

Nevertheless, the prevailing view here at present--if nothing
happens to force him to change--is that he will not change KENNEDY's
foreign policy (5G) (Part 10) nor in method and [6G] to give
assurance. He, therefore, will retain most of KENNEDY's advisers,
the most important being his number-one adviser in international
affairs, BUNDY. Since the new President has a propensity for
domestic political affairs, they expect him to rely more on the

Secretary of State. It is well known that JOHNSON especially
appreciates RUSK.
Political circles here also believe that (Part 11] he will
continue the domestic policy of his predecessor, at least until the
presidential elections. It is, therefore, (B val supposed) that he
(B val will retain) most of his Cabinet and will enter the election
campaign on the basis of KENNEDY's program. Also, they think it
most likely that JOHNSON will be the candidate of the Democratic
Party in the coming presidential elections at the end of next year.
They think that the chances of GOLDWATER, the right-wing Republican,
have lessened and that the Republicans might nominate ROCKEFELLER or
NIXON and that the latter's chances have increased. (Part 12]

It is risky to make any predictions now about the results of
the coming presidential campaign. Nevertheless, it appears that
it will be between JOHNSON and a middle-of-the-road Republican
not a radical right-winger, because the prevailing sentiment of
public opinion is a demand to repair the breach and close the wound
and to raise (to higher priority) the policy of reconciliation
and interest in domestic affairs.

Some of Peking's supporters in North Viet Nam, Laos and North
Korea are reiterating that KENNEDY's murder reveals a victory of
reactionary trends. It is to be noted that at present there is an
increase in the activity of the Viet Cong forces in South Viet Nam.
[Part 13] Also, the press of North Korea and the Pathet Lao in
Laos have intensified their attack on Washington. They explain the
position of Peking and its supporters (4G) that on the one hand, their
view may be represented in [the statement) that the policy of the
new President will be less flexible than that of his predecessor but,
on the other hand, perhaps the attack is a means of testing the
rigidity of the new American administration.

Some circles in Britain believe that JOHNSON is an astute
politician who is skillful in figuring and evaluating and a con-
servative who is practiced in conducting a policy of conciliation.

heart that is unyielding,

III. The Embassy's observations:

A. KENNEDY's death has created a new situation in America
and on the futemational scene, the landmarks of which are at
present unclear. Therefore, it appears to us that the position
which prevails in Western and Eastern diplomatic circles and in the
neutral group is one based on watchfulness and acting with extreme
care and caution and attempting to begin a careful operation to
disclose, on the one hand, the real leanings [Part 15) of the
new administration and its method of operation and the forces which
can influence it, while working on the other hand to establish
friendly, constructive relations with it as far as possible.

B.
//
This has been clear in the contacts of MIKOYAN in
Washington and his statements about his government's desire to
continue the policy of reaching an understanding and in the reports
of some Russian diplomats that KHRUSHCHEV and JOHNSON must meet, etc.
The same attitude is to be noted with the British, the French,
the Yugoslavs, etc. [Part 16]
i
C. Matters will remain unclear as long as the circum-
stances, mtives and forces behind KENNEDY's death remain
undefined. Then, any basic surprise in this regard might have a
long-range effect on domestic and external conditions. The present
[situation] is that KENNEDY and his top aides sensed the toughness,
and (B val despair) of the forces which opposed their liberal,
realistic policy and, therefore, had not concealed that from us,
something which we had explained fully to the Ministry.

C. [sic] Despite the obvious difference in the
personalities of KENNEDY and JOHNSON-the former was a blend
[Part 17] of idealism, and realism, rare intelligence, broad
knowledge, deep understanding of the developments of history
and the secrets of human psychology at its highest and lowest,
loyalty to the welfare of the world and his country and of courage
and fidelity to the rule of reason and the bond of friendship;
also, he [1 wd G) drawing around him domestic and foreign policies
while JOHNSON has more of an inclination and adherence than KENNEDY

to the economic system based on free enterprise and, therefore,
is more inclined to the right wing (Part 18] and closer to the
conservative policy and the past generation and further from the
left wing which is more intellectual and possesses long-range
imagination and which KENNEDY had led--despite this, it is [1 wd G]
at present to make any predictions about the final course which the
new President will follow. The prevailing view here is that there
will be no basic change in KENNEDY's policy until the presidential
elections are held the end of next year. Nevertheless, it depends
on the development of events. [Part 19].
!
D. Signs that KENNEDY's policy will be continued appear
in the speech of the new President before Congress, the statements
of top officials here in the State Department, the writings of top
writers and the retention, so far, of the members of KENNEDY's
cabinet and his top advisers and confidants in the White House,
the State Department and other departments,

E. Then, the many complications domestically and exter-
nally would make any minor change, particularly toward Moscow, easy
practically but dangerous realistically. (Part 20]

Since it is likely that the new President will be less (B val
able) to resist pressure than his predecessor and since, because
of his long service in domestic politics, he may by nature be more
prone to keep considerations of domestic politics in mind and to
proceed in conformity with their (Bval requirements) and to endeavor
to satisfy them and because his philosphy and his methods are
different from those of his predecessor. It would therefore be
to our interest until the presidential elections are held to follow
a policy which would not expose him to pressure or embarrassment so
as not to enablé our enemies to draw him [Part 21) over to their
side. This is the essence of the matter at present. It would appear
that our opponents will try at the first opportunity to complicate
matters between us and the new administration by exploiting: the
situation in Yemen, or the Algerian-Moroccan dispute and our
position toward it; or the Arab-Israeli dispute if they find a
chance to raise it; etc.

In the light of the above paragraph, it would appear to us

at present that JOHNSON may continue the policy of his predecessor
toward us. He may be encouraged to do that by the [Part 22]
positive results achieved by the policy of his predecessor in this
regard and by the supporters of this policy both in and outside
the government, the most important being Secretary of State RUSK
and FULBRIGHT, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, a confidant of JOHNSON and one of the first ones who
supported him as a candidate for president in the 1960 elections.

SYRIANS CLAIM ZIONISTS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

FR Damascus: PERRONE CAPANO 29 Nov 63
TO Rome: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 413

The Syrian regime, always in search of new anti-Zionist
arguments, has found, in the murder of President KENNEDY,
material for a rather unorthodox interpretation of the lamentable
event.

According to the Ba'thist organ, the murder of the
(B val President) must be attributed to Zionism, which is really
responsible and which is now trying to cover up the misdeed.
The pro-government daily paper Al Thawra also asserts that
Zionism had a principal role in the event in Dallas.

has returned the note delivered to that Embassy by the Cuban
Government protesting the detention in this capital of a Mexican
woman employed at the Cuban Embassy in the course of the
investigations surrounding the assassination of KENNEDY.
The above-mentioned note, the text of which was revealed
in Havana, was written in extremely violent terms. The
Mexican Government does not contest the fact that the
employee was detained and a house search made on the day
following the Dallas crime, when it was learned that the
assassin had been here and had visited the Cuban Embassy as
well as that of the Soviet Union. Both of those
diplomatic missions reported that the visit involved a request
for visas for the two countries. It also appears certain that
the search in the home of the employee of the Cuban Embassy
was carried out with a certain brutality, which, moreover,
is usual in such cases here. The aspect [4G/M] Cuban Government
seems to want to exploit here is that the search was made by
order of the official candidate for the Mexican presidency,
at the time still the Minister of the Interior, who, as I
reported in my telegram Nr. 290((A)) is opposed by the leftists.

INCREASED TENSION IN HAVANA FOLLOWING VENEZUELAN COMPLAINT TO OAS

FR Havana: GONZAGA FERREIRA 3 Dec 63
TO Lisbon: Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Msg Nr: 20

Confidential.

I wish to inform Your Excellency that a certain tension
prevails in the Latin-American embassies accredited here, since
they think that the risk of a break-off of relations with Cuba
has grown dangerously since the well-founded Venezuelan complaint
against Cuba because of her aid to the FALN and the resulting
convocation of the OAS. They think that ROMULO BETANCOURT,
while requesting hemispheric military action against Cuba in the
OAS, knows that he may not, or almost certainly will not, obtain
enough votes for his proposal. But such (2 gr G) would grant him
the authority then to demand and specify a total break of relations
with Cuba by the American States. The Brazilian Embassy believes
that Brazil will try not to go so far as to vote for a break, but
if the others approve it, she would have to follow the majority.

Tension between Cuba and Mexico has also increased suddenly
as the result of a violent note which the Foreign Ministry here
delivered to the Mexican Ambassador because of the detention in
Mexico City of a Mexican woman employed at the Cuban consulate
who was reportedly connected with the accused assassin of
President KENNEDY, LEE OSWALD. The Mexicans reportedly returned
the above-mentioned note.

The death of President KENNEDY, the Fidelista campaign to
incriminate U.S. Rightists in that assassination, lack of
knowledge as to the future direction of Washington policy [1 gr G]

Venezuela and the threat of armed action or at least diplomatic
isolation and the immediate tightening of the embargo, the
knowledge that this country is behind the subversion in Venezuela
with arms and men (the Cuban press, while ridiculing the incident
of the arms on the beach at Paraguana, gives no indications
whatever of indignation or repudiation of the Venezuelan accusa-
tion) have created a growing feeling of crisis. Cuban forces
continue with precautionary measures, and at dawn today there
was observed a large movement of military transports to the east
[2 gr G] call-up of the militia. On the other hand, the internal
counterrevolutionaries reportedly have been very restless for
four days in expectation of the OAS resolutions.

For WINIEWICZ.

In conversation with me, MCCLOY, a member of the presidential
commission stated that he has serious doubts of the credibility
of the investigation to date. He does not eliminate the possibility
that the attempt on KENNEDY was made by two persons. However, in
view of JOHNSON's order that the commission investigate also the
circumstances of OSWALD's slaying, some of the commission's
operations and its report could come after RUBY's trial and perhaps
even after the verdict and appeals. In the meantime the trial
was postponed until 3 January (sic), and the FBI released to the
press information that their investigation confirms OSWALD's guilt,
and that he had no accomplices.

WESTERN ARMY TOLD TO STAND BY FOR ALERT IN REACTION TO DEATH
OF KENNEDY

Information not previously available reveals that 1st Div
Hq, Bahia Honda, was advised to keep personnel of its command
available in case a state of alert were declared in response
to events following the death of President KENNEDY. The
message, intercepted from (Coval 4th) Army Corps Hq, Pinar
del Rio, also prohibited statements pro or con with regard
to the death of the President.

Bahia Honda replied that steps had already been taken in
compliance with these orders.

COMMENT:

Units of the Eastern Naval District were placed on alert,
presumably due to the proximity of Guantanamo Naval Base, after
the KENNEDY assassination, as were unidentified army coastal
observation posts in the First Army area (2/0/CUJ/R58-63). There
is no indication, however, that Western Army units were formally
put on a state of alert.

SEMINAR ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND PEACE MEETS IN INDIA

FR New Delhi: GARNIER 9 Dec 63
TO Paris: The Department
Msg Nr: 1518-21
[4-part message complete]

 The conference on foreign affairs and peace organized by
the \"Committee of Indian Parliamentarians for Peace\" (my
telegram Nr. 1418((A))) was opened on Saturday by the Prime
Minister, who dwelt on the beneficent effects of the lessening
of tension between East and West and on the necessity that the
efforts in this direction should not be interrupted as a
consequence of President KENNEDY's assassination. He repeated
the Indian Government's attachment to the policy of nonalignment
despite Chinese aggression, which it had been obliged to stop
by force, and pointed out that it is not enough to denounce war,
but that it is advisable to find means to prevent it.

 The only foreign representatives -- despite the efforts
of DIWAN CHAMAN LALL, who incidentally had asked me to obtain
messages from President DE GAULLE, Mr. POMPIDOU, and Your
Excellency and to whom I replied that it is not our tradition
to send them to meetings of this type -- are Soviet, Yugoslav,
Ceylonese and British. Moreover, Madame NIKOLAEVA, member of
the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, brought congratulations only
from the nongovernmental organization. Yugoslavia delegated
Mr. VILFAN, former ambassador to New Delhi. Mr. GREENWOOD,
Chairman of the Labor Party, read a communication from
Mr. HAROLD WILSON but made it clear that he was participating

Mr. MALAVIYA, former Minister of Fuel, and (B val Mr. KRISHNA

a point of stating that in spite of the provocations of China
and Pakistan, India was maintaining her peaceful policy. He
observed that there can be disarmament or peace only to the
extent that there is a rapprochement between the USSR and the
United States: \"The more these two powers work together, the
better it will be for the world.\"

WASHINGTON CONCERNED OVER CAMBODIAN BROADCAST ALLUDING TO DEATH
OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

FR New York: NONG KIMNY 10 Dec 63 1146
TO Phnom Penh: MINAFERES --
Msg Nr: 151/DGP/X

I have the honor to inform you that Ambassador YOST, on
instructions from the State Department, told me that yesterday
morning Radio Cambodia broadcast a bulletin from the Ministry
of Information inviting the Cambodian people to celebrate the
recent death of \"the enemies of Cambodia, DIEM and SARIT.\"
The text of this broadcast stated, \"the big boss ((A)) of these
aggressors has met the same fate. Those who ill-treat Cambodia
and scorn our revered leader will not live long and will be
destroyed.\" The transmission announced that leave would be
granted to any official wanting to attend this celebration.

Ambassador YOST consequently expressed the serious mis-
givings of Washington at the allusion to the death of President
KENNEDY. The American Government is shocked at hearing the
allusion in this \"barbaric declaration\" and expresses the hope
that a public disavowal of the allusion to the death of President
KENNEDY may be made.

I replied that I reserve my opinion for the moment, since I
do not hold the text of the statement. Nevertheless, I pointed
out to Ambassador YOST that His Royal Highness and the Royal
Government gave proof of their esteem and respect for President
KENNEDY by sending Prime Minister KANTOL to Washington to attend
the funeral. I also told him that our people enjoy a long history
of culture, civilization and religion. Therefore, I rejected
categorically the expression \"barbaric declaration\" used by

CAMBODIAN COUNTER PROTEST OVER REFERENCE TO KENNEDY DEATH

FR Phnom Penh: MINAFERES 12 Dec 63 1825
TO New York: MISSIONCAM Priority
Msg Nr: 325/DG/X

Following is the text of a Royal Government communique pub-
lished today:

\"On 11 December 1963, the United States Government, through
its Ambassador in Phnom Penh, protested to the Royal Government
regarding the Information Department communique which is reported
to have expressed Cambodia's pleasure at the deaths of NGO DINH
DIEM, NGO DINH NHU, SARIT THANARAT, and President KENNEDY. The
Royal Government, after having consulted the Cambodian and French
texts broadcast by RADIODIFFUSION NATIONALE or published by the
Information Ministry, clarifies for international opinion that
no allusion was made to the tragic death of President KENNEDY on
the occasion of the comments on the death of SARIT THANARAT. On
the contrary, it must be remembered that Cambodia observed three
days of national mourning out of respect for the deceased President
and that His Highness the Premier represented the Chief of State
at the funeral in Washington. It is, therefore, absurd to claim
that Cambodia has not paid due homage to the memory of the noble
President of the United States.

It must be admitted that the feelings experienced by the
Cambodian people upon hearing of the deaths of NGO DINH DIEM and
SARIT THANARAT may be different. In fact, although President
KENNEDY was unanimously respected by all Cambodians in spite of the
injustice of American policy toward Cambodia, the South Vietnamese
and Thai dictators, who were the implacable enemies of our inde-
pendence, could arouse nothing but general hostility from our
countrymen. There is a nuance which American diplomats and observers
seem not to understand in the sentiments expressed in the past few

Please communicate the Royal Government's statement to the
State Department and protest energetically against the expression
\"barbarous declaration\" used by that Ambassador [sic] YOST,

insult to Cambodia's honor and dignity, for which the United

EMBASSY WASHINGTON REPORTS REACTION TO KENNEDY AND CASTRO
INTERVIEWS

FR Paris: The Department 13 Dec 63
TO Havana: French Embassy --
Msg Nr: 516-20

[5-part message complete]

I am communicating to you herewith Washington telegram
Nr. 7087-91 of 12 December 1963.

The Cuban affair has abruptly returned to the forefront with
the republication of articles written for L'Express by Mr. JEAN
DANIEL after his conversations with President KENNEDY and CASTRO,
first in the weekly The New Republic, and then in the New York
Times and the Washington Post. From the comments of the American
press, I might single out the following elements:

1. Although President KENNEDY did indeed mention Hungary
in his conversation with Mr. ADZHUBEI--Mr. PIERRE SALINGER has
just acknowledged it after having denied it--it was only, according
to the White House spokesman, to show the importance of Cuba to the
United States. On the other hand, the President did not make any
allusion to the fact that the United States was a passive witness
to the Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956. In any case, since
The Bay of Pigs, President KENNEDY never had any intention of invad-
ing Cuba. He categorically answered a question on this subject by
Mr. ADZHUBEI in the negative.

2. The administration puts no trust in CASTRO'S
statements to the effect that the Soviets installed rockets in
Cuba to prevent an invasion of the island by the United States.

At most, it is thought here that Mr. KHRUSHCHEV may have told
CASTRO that the installation of these rockets was indispensable to
his country's defense.

3. Mr. KHRUSHCHEV's decision is still explained by his wish
to compensate quickly and cheaply for the Soviet Union's strategic.
inferiority. Moreover, as a study by the Rand Corporation recalls,
this is what CASTRO told Mr. JULIEN of Le Monde when he admitted:
\"It was not to ensure our own defense that we accepted the rockets,
but to reinforce the socialist camp's position. This is the truth,
even if others provide different explanations.\"

4. However that may be, the publication of these interviews
puts President JOHNSON in a delicate position. As Mr. CHALMERS
ROBERTS remarked in the Washington Post, Mr. KHRUSHCHEV's
emissaries hint that perhaps an arrangement is possible between
the United States and CASTRO. The latter, in his interview with
Mr. DANIEL, intimated that he might put an end to his terrorist
agitation campaign in Latin America if the United States lifted
its economic blockade of the island. Therefore, Mr. ROBERTS
acknowledges, this perhaps gives a margin to the United States
for maneuvering, but \"only a short time after having acceded to
the presidency and only a year before the elections, Mr. JOHNSON'S
possibilities for action in this field are very limited.\"

JOHNSON'S PROSPECTS: UAR AMBASSADOR, WASHINGTON, REPORTS
DISCUSSION WITH NORWEGIAN AMBASSADOR

FR Washington: Ambassador 22 Dec 63
TO Cairo: KHARGIA
Msg Nr: 412
[Parts 1-6 of a 7-part message)((A))

I. The Norwegian Ambassador to Washington visited me and
the conversation dealt with the domestic situation in America
and some aspects of the international situation and the situation
in the Middle East.

II. He said:

A. The world had suffered a great loss in KENNEDY's
death. It appeared to him that the killer was not a party to
a conspiracy but was a blind fanatic nourished by the radical
milieu of the state where he lived.

B. He added that he had accompanied JOHNSON for four
days during his visit to Norway as KENNEDY's Vice President and
that he had noted the following: [Part 2]

JOHNSON was practical-minded. He was not good at
listening. He was an expert in American domestic affairs but
had not handled foreign affairs very much. He was impatient
and quick-tempered; nevertheless, he added that his assumption
of the presidency had changed his disposition.

C. He said that JOHNSON would be the presidential
candidate of the Democratic Party in the coming election campaign
and that the Republicans had not yet decided on a serious rival
who could beat him. He said that he thought that JOHNSON would
win in the coming presidential election. [Part 3]

D. He stated that their conjecture in Oslo was that
JOHNSON would continue to pursue KENNEDY's foreign policy,
particularly with regard to trying to reach an understanding
with the Russians and calming the tension of the cold war,
although it was not unlikely that his methods in this would
be somewhat different from KENNEDY's. Nevertheless, he said
that JOHNSON's job would not be easy since he was facing
problems in South America and NATO and Southeast Asia and the
Middle East. He said that KHRUSHCHEV appeared to be more
anxious than the Americans [Part 4] for an understanding with
Washington because of numerous domestic problems and his dispute
with Peking and the presence of opposition to him in Russia and
some of the Communist nations. He said that KHRUSHCHEV had to
continue his policy of truce for many reasons.

He stated that the policy of truce might change
for unexpected reasons, such as KHRUSHCHEV's death, etc.

He said that he thought that Labor would win in
the elections in Britain. He noted that they would continue
the policy of rapprochement with the Soviets. He pointed out
that the Laborites would strive [Part 5] for a further
rapprochement with West Germany and said that their policy
would be progressive with regard to racial discrimination and
colonial problems.

III. When I was asked about conditions in the Middle
East and our relations with America, I explained the development
of our relations with America and friendly nations over the
past years and how this development had led to results which
were rewarding to all. I went into detail about the period of
transition through which some of the nations of the Middle East
are passing and the conditions which had resulted and said that
tendentious propaganda was giving a [Part 6] false interpretation
to the events of the Middle East. I discussed our domestic
policy which is based on economic development in conformity with
practical and (1 wd G) methods, and the state and development of
the country and what we had achieved in this regard in the
roughest circumstances. I explained our foreign policy based

and seem to appear more reticent regarding the American citizen,
a former officer, living in Cuba. Mexican services will issue
a transit visa as soon as the American Embassy in Mexico City,

I suggest an intervention also be made in Washington. I

CASTRO INTERVIEW ON RELATIONS WITH U.S.

FR Paris: The Department 3. Jan 64
TO Havana: French Embassy --
Msg Nr: 2-4

[3-part message complete]

I am communicating to you herewith Washington
telegram Nr. 25-27 of 2 January 1964.

On 1 January Mr. FIDEL CASTRO granted an interview by
telephone to a newsman from the ABC radio and television
network. The Cuban leader repeated that he hoped to
normalize relations between his country and the United States,
and he added: \"Henceforth it is up to the United States to
take a step in that direction.\" Mr. CASTRO stated that
\"until the tragic death of President KENNEDY,\" he thought
that \"the normalization of Cuban relations with the American
administration was possible.\" While acknowledging that
public opinion in the United States is still hostile to
Cuba and wants the naval blocade of the island strengthened,
he appeared \"full of hope\" as to the future of his relations
with President JOHNSON.

The Cuban Chief of Government even gave concrete proof
of his good will by bringing up the problem of the
indemnification of American citizens who were victims of
nationalization in the following terms: \"We are ready to
speak of the indemnities due under the heading of the
nationalization of American property by the revolutionary((A)).
Thus, you can see that we are sincere when we say that we
are ready to talk, but that does not depend only on us.\"

However, Mr. CASTRO did refuse to pay the price of

FR New York: Polish Mission to the UN 27 Jan 64 1010
TO Warsaw: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Routine
Msg. Nr. 28

For WINIEWICZ

During our talks, MCCLOY, on his own initiative, brought up the subject
of criticism of the European press, especially the French, of the activity
of WARREN's commission.

In a lengthy monologue he condemned accusations that the commission
intends, in the name of public interest, to gloss over the evidence of the
assassination and with its authority support the conclusions reached by
the FBI.

He wants to assure us that he will not permit any distortion or conceal-
ment of the facts; however, from materials at his disposal, he is more and
more convinced that OSWALD committed the crime by himself. I acknowledged
his information with the statement that interest in the commission's report
is great everywhere because of the shock of KENNEDY's assassination and of
the world position of the USA.

McCLOY's statements confirm the opinion circulating here that the
commission is mainly interested in proving that the assassination was not
linked with any foreign centers. At the same time, public statements made

WARREN COMMISSION FINDINGS SUMMARIZED FOR BRAZILIAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY

FR Washington: JURACY MAGALHOES- 25 Sep 64
TO Rio de Janeiro: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 1614

As announced at the beginning of this week, the report
of the commission headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, which investigated the assassination of President
KENNEDY, was handed to President JOHNSON yesterday. The
report is very lengthy, but is to be printed for wide distribu-
tion, according to the desire of President JOHNSON that there
be no doubts in regard to the circumstances and motivation
of that crime.

Sunday afternoon, the day after tomorrow, the report
will be made public, which will make possible its transcription
in the morning press on Monday.
:

The ceremony of handing the report to President JOHNSON
was attended by all members of the commission appointed by
him, which became known as the WARREN Commission and which
was made up of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Senator
RICHARD RUSSELL and JOHN SHERMAN COOPER, Congressman HALE
BOGGS and GERALD FORD and our Mr. JOHN J. MOCLOY and Mr. ALLEN
DULLES.

It appears that the conclusion of the WARREN Commission
is that LEE OSWALD was the sole author of the crime and that
his motive was strictly personal. In regard to the assassination
of OSWALD, the Commission appears to have accepted the thesis
that JACK RUBY also acted on strictly personal motivation both
evidently having suffered from mental unbalance or instability.

CUBAN STATEMENT ON VISA FOR OSWALD
FR Havana: RAUL ROA 25 Nov 63
TO New York: Cubarn Mission to the UN
Msg. Nr. 7469

Lam am reproducing below the note given to the press by the
Ministry:

With relation to the informat con published today in the
newspaper Excelsion in Mexico City, affirming that LEE HARVEY
OSWALD had requested a transit visa for travel to the Soviet
Union at the Cuban Consulate in. Mexico in September, the Cuban
Government requested information from the officials of our
Consulate in that city confirming that it is certain that
MI. LEE HARVEY OSWALD requested the transit visa for travel to
the Soviet Union on 27 September in the said Consulate

On being informed by the consular officials that their
office could not grant such a visa without the authorization
of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations, which likewise
would not grant it if it was not previously authorized by the
country of destination, Mr. OSWALD left the Consulate visibly
disgusted.

The said visa was never granted.

This detail in connection with the other circumstance
that surround the facts, confirm our suspicion that the
assassination of KENNEDY was a provocation against world peace,
perfectly and thoroughly planned by the most reactionary sectors
of the United States

Cuban
TOP SECRET DINAR
3/0/CUD/T1384-63

It is evident that these sectors planned beforehand to
involve Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds.

The inconceivable and inexplicable impunity with which an
individual of known penal antecedents assassinated OSWALD, the
principal accused of the assassination of President KENNEDY, in
the presence of the police themselves and in the (56) of a
prison, demonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable manner
that the powerful reactionary political forces within the
United States are making use of all their resources and influences
in order to conceal those who master-minded KENNEDY's assassination,
and the true motives for it.

World public opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds.
It is absurd that t the political authorities and the prosecuting
attorney of Dallas have declared that the case is closed when
hardly 48 hours have passed since a deed of of so great a result as
the assassination of the President of the United States..

Jim Johnson, during an interview with Dr. Louis Tordella
on 20 January 1976.

Para. 1. - NSA requested permission to retain
photocopies of those reports on which we had worked merely
as record copies of our efforts on behalf of the Commission.
It was felt that if a question should arise at that time
concerning what analytic efforts had been involved and the
number of manhours expended, a record copy would prove useful.
No operational use was made of these documents except to
hold them on file for a period of time which cannot now be
determined. To the best of our present knowledge, the photo-
copies have now been destroyed. Absolutely no results
relevant to the assassination were obtained through NSA'S
analytic look at the exhibits. The Commission, in the person
of Mr. Allan Dulles, had asked Dr. Tordella, informally, to
review the exhibits for any secret writing or codes which
might have been contained in the documents. Dr. Tordella,
after causing a careful review of the documents by NSA crypt-
analysts, reported verbally to Mr. Dulles and other Commission
members that nothing whatsoever had been achieved by the
analytic effort. No written reply was submitted.

Para. 2. - NSA is uncertain as to what is precisely
meant by these comments, but we assume that the comments on
names refer to our biographic files which are maintained on
foreign personalities of potential intelligence significance.
As the Committee knows, these biographic files are maintained
(now at CIA incidentally) as analytic support. It is also
possible that the Commission was referring to the fact that
names are frequently seen in traffic collected for foreign
intelligence purposes and therefore NSA might have access
to foreign names not otherwise available to the Intelligence
Community.

Para. 3. - It may well be that CIA did obtain such
transmissions and pass them to NSA for analysis, but no one
presently working that analytic area recalls such a request.
Discussions with Dr. Tordella also failed to shed any light
on this subject. There are no files or records which we have
been able to locate from that time frame which would sub-
stantiate such a claim. In fact, the only file the responsible
analytic group has been able to locate concerning a request
from the Warren Commission deals with a file compiled from
open sources citing major dates in the last months of Oswald's
life. Presumably the date file was to be compared with NSA
product on/about the key dates in the hope that something
could be deduced. The file does not contain any \"hits.\"
The analysts who performed this effort have since retired.

Para. 4. - The informal request from Mr. Dulles is
the known total extent of NSA's role in assisting in the
investigation. The file discussed in Paragraph 3 is the only
file thus far recovered. There is no information which can
now be identified which was developed from Cuban or Soviet
transmissions relating to the assassination.

Para. 5. We have no information on this subject
at all. However, pursuant to the subject raised during the
Tordella interview, we have searched our files manually,
and as Mr. Lowman agreed during the Tordella interview, we
have recovered three product reports (Inclosures 2 through
4) which show that Cuban military forces did go on alert
immediately after the assassination. There is no SIGINT
evidence, however, that the Cuban forces were alerted prior
to the assassination, thereby suggesting that they had prior
knowledge of the event.

Dear Tom:

In connection with the Select Committee's investigation of
the assassination of President Kennedy, we earlier received
answers to certain questions put to NSA. Since then we have
examined other material pertaining to NSA's contribution to
the Warren Commission's investigation and we desire further in-
formation from NSA.

By way of background for this request, we note the Warren
Commission provided NSA various documents and asked NSA to re-
view them for any cryptological significance. NSA found no
cryptological significance and its report of this fact was pub-
lished by the Commission.

1. By letter of July 10, 1964, (a copy of which is attached)
Mr. Rankin provided General Blake a copy of certain documents
requested by Dr. Tordella for NSA's files. Since NSA's analysis
of the documents was apparently completed at the time of Rankin's
letter, we wish to know why NSA wanted to keep these documents
for its file. Further, we wish to know what use. if any, was
made of these documents and what results relevant to the assassina-
tion were obtained from such use.

2. In a Commission staff internal memorandum, discussing the
documents provided NSA, it is reported that NSA is \"primarily
interested in names,\" and NSA claims it has \"information on names
which the CIA does not have.\" Assuming these statements are ac-
curate, we wish to know what significance such names would have

to NSA and what information on names NSA had that CIA did not.
If names had significance, what names did NSA use in its analysis?

3. We are informed that CIA obtained transmissions from the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City for November or December 1963 and
that it may have passed these to NSA for analysis. Did NSA re-
ceive these transmissions or any transmissions relevant to the
assassination inquiry? Did it analyze them? What were the re-
sults of its analysis?

4.
We are interested in learning the extent of NSA's role in
assisting in the investigation of the assassination. In that
connection, please inform the Committee the extent of NSA files
relating to the assassination. Please p lease provide the staff of the
Committee access to those files. Please ease provide the staff with
a summary of all information NSA developed from Cuban or Soviet
transmissions relating to the assassination.

5. We have been informed that after the assassination the
Cuban government instructed its embassies and consulates to re-
turn all files on Oswald to Cuba. What information does NSA
have on whether such instructions were issued?

6. In connection with the answers to questions 4 and 5, please
indicate whether such material was provided the Warren Commission
and provide copies of all documents evidencing that fact,

We would appreciate receiving a response to these questions,
as soon as possible and to expedite this inquiry we are sending
a copy of this letter to Mr. Foster of NSA.

ALERT IN ORIENTE PROVINCE BELIEVED TO BE TERMINATED
The alert in Oriente Provinca (see 2/0/CUN/R196-63) is be-
lieved to be teralnated. The alert, apparently prompted by
President KENNEDY's death on 22 November, was possibly pre-
scheduled to terminate on 25 November. There have been two orders
which suggest that the alert was destined to be concluded on
25 November; they are:

1) Access to the Coastal Observation Post at Punta
20-574-05 אמא( was restricted until 25 November because
of the alert (see 2/QS/CUN/R667-63); and

2) Subordinates of Banes, Readquarters Pastern Naval
District, were to receive further orders on the 25th, presumably
concerning their alert status (2/0/CW/196-63); по Buch orders
have been noted in communications.

There have been no further references in Intercepted communi-
cations to the alert since 02222 on 23 November (2/QS/CUR/R667-63).

It is possible that the restricted access to the Observation
Post at Punta Halsi extends to other Observation Posts in Oriente

Observation Posts were placed In an alert status
(2/21/CM/R138-67), 204 that the restriction was to be lifted on

Further indication that the alert has terminated is the fact
that the Coman Navy was engaged in an island-wide communications
exercise an 23 Novecher. It is considered unlikely that such an
exercise Kaila be conducted umer alert cordistons.

There have been at further sefereixes to the alert atatたせた

to be for the period 1959 - 31 December 1974. However, our first successfu.
interception of Cuban agent communications was on 17 April 1962. We
continued to intercept the communications through the end of the period,
but a communications change on 31 May 1964 rendered the messages unreadable.

CUBAN AGENT ACTIVITY IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE 1959-31 DECEMBER 1974

Cuba used agents for intelligence and subversion in North, Centra
and South America; Africa; and Asia. Whenever possible, they operated
under diplomatic cover, getting instructions and communicating through
Cuban missions.

In the Western Hemisphere during the early sixties, diplomatic
cover became less available to the Cubans, and by spring of 1962,
Cuba had diplomatic relations with only one-third of the Latin America
countries. Cuba's interest in fomenting discord and promoting revolu-
tion obviously grew as she became more isolated officially from the
rest of the hemisphere, and the Cuban General Directorate of Intelli-
gence (DGI) inevitably increased its reliance on illegal/clandestine
agents. By the time of the Cuban \"missile crisis\" in October 1962,
Cuba was known to be in communication with agents in Florida, Puerto
Rico, Central America, and Ecuador, all areas in which diplomatic
cover was not available. The DGI expanded its clandestine contacts
as more Western Hemisphere countries severed diplomatic relations.
By the end of 1964, Cuba enjoyed formal relations in the hemisphere
with only Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, and the United Nations in New York.
The DGI maintained contact with its agents by all the routine under-
cover means (e.g., personal contact, prearranged signaling, secret
writing, hidden meanings in innocuous appearing mail and telegrams,
microdots, radio, and clandestine mail drops).

In 1962, the DGI was in direct or indirect contact with at least
35 covernames/covernumbers/pseudonyms believed to represent separate
agents; in 1963 this number grew to 49 and in 1964 the number was
back to 24. Agent locations for the period were New York, Miami,
Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia, La Paz, Guatemala, Mexico,
Chile, Ottawa, Lima and possibly the Dominican Republic.

During the period for which we have information (1962-1964),
Cuban agents were tasked with performing a wide range and variety of
tasks. With the exceptions of a task levied in 1962, possibly in
Ecuador, for the sabotage of any U.S. property and attacks and raids
on the U. S. Embassy, and a plan in Puerto Rico for the assassinations
of ANTONIO VECIANA, Puerto Rican spokesman for ALPHA 66, and
GERONIMO ESTEVEZ, a Cuban exile in Puerto Rico, all information on
DGI-associated activities fell into the categories of recruiting,
gathering information and reporting, spreading propaganda, and pure
logistics.

Agents in Miami, Costa Rica, and Guatemala were to establish and
maintain contacts with Cuban exiles and report on any counter-revolu-
tionary activities. The DGI directed that agents procure and send to
Cuba maps of their respective countries and guides to major cities.
All agents were furnished secure mail drop addresses in Havana and
intermediate cities outside of Cuba through which they could submit
reports, either in cable form or by secret writing using invisible

inks on innocent appearing letters.

A primary target for penetration was ALPHA 66, a Florida-based
exile organization reputed to have near-legendary powers and resources
The Cuban government still claims U.S. government direction and fundin
of the organization whose claimed activities included night raids
along the Cuban coast, infiltration of agents into Cuba, harassment
of the Cuban armed forces, and weapons drops to counter-revolutionary
groups on the island.

Agents in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico were to collect order-of-
battle information on U.S. forces, vessels and aircraft in Panama and
Puerto Rico, to establish activity norms and report any significant
deviations from the norm. Agent AMAPOLA in Miami was charged with
reporting on alert status of U.S. forces at Fort Bragg, Fort Benning
and Homestead Air Force Base. The field agents were to either
personally collect the information or cultivate and subvert individual:
who had access to it.

Where possible, agents attempted to work with or through Communis
parties in their countries. The Costa Rican Communist Party was used
by the Cuban agent there as an information collection organization, bu
Agent BRUNO in La Paz encountered problems in dealing with the Bolivia:
Communist Party. Agent PAMELA in Puerto Rico cultivated and encourage
the activities of JUAN ANGEL SILEN ACEVEDO, Assistant Secretary Genera.
of the Puerto Rican Independent Party.

ANY MATERIAL RELEVANT TO THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY OR
ANY INVESTIGATION INTO THE ASSASSINATION.

We have reviewed the Cuban materials previously compiled to
respond to SSCI and Church Committee hearings. The only information
regarding the KENNEDY assassination which surfaced might be termed
reactive; that is, it reflects some of the reactions of the Cuban
government to the assassination. Army and Navy elements in Eastern
Cuba were placed on alert status on 22 November, apparently in
reaction to news of the President's death. This action was probably
a reflection of the Cuban government's paranoia over a possible
military action against Cuba, possibly originating from the U. S.
Navy Base at Guantanamo. That the Cubans were sensitive to suggestion
that they might be implicated in the KENNEDY assassination is very
evident in the following 25 November press release from the Cuban
Foreign Ministry:

\"With relation to the information published today ((25 November))
in the newspaper EXCELSIOR in Mexico City, affirming that
LEE HARVEY OSWALD had requested a transit visa for travel to the
Soviet Union at the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September, the Cuban
Government requested information from the officials of our Consulate
in that city confirming that it is certain that Mr. LEE HARVEY OSWALD
requested the transit visa for travel to the Soviet Union on
27 September in the said consulate.

\"On being informed by the consular officials that their office
could not grant such a visa without the authorization of the Cuban
Ministry of Foreign Relations, which likewise would not grant it if
it was not previously authorized by the country of destination,
Mr. Oswald left the Consulate visibly disgusted.

\"The said visa was never granted.

\"This detail, in connection with the other circumstances that
surrounds the facts, confirm our suspicion that the assassination of
KENNEDY was a provocation against world peace, perfectly and thoroughl
planned by the most reactionary sectors of the United States.

\"It is evident that these sectors planned beforehand to involve
Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds.

\"The inconceivable and inexplicable impunity with which an
individual of known penal antecedents assassinated OSWALD, the
principal accused of the assassination of President KENNEDY, in
the presence of the police themselves and in the basement of a
prison, demonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable manner that
the powerful reactionary political forces within the United States
are making use of all their resources and influences in order to
conceal those who master-minded KENNEDY's assassination, and the
true motives for it.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 15 June 1978
SUBJECT: Actions Taken by NSA to Locate Information Related
to the Assassination of President Kennedy

A. Over the past fourteen and one-half years, NSA has
performed a number of separate in-depth reviews of materials in
its files in an attempt to isclate data that might be relevant
to the assassination of President Kennedy. Nothing of significance
has been determined as a result of those reviews.

1. November-December 1963 Immediately after the
assassination, NSAinitiated a large-scale manual and machine
review of available SIGINT, including all U.S./Cuba traffic (NSA
intercepted messages at an average of 1,000 per day at that time).
A computer search was initiated using Oswald's name as the minimum
for research criteria. Additionally, all traffic between Cuba/New
Orleans and Cuba/Dallas was manually reviewed (an analyst involved
recalled that 25 to 50 analysts reviewed the traffic manually,
along with traffic from Cuba and some Soviet traffic). Sometime
during the search, items from the Oswald address book provided by
the FBI were added to the search criteria.

2. 1964 - Warren Commission The Commission, in the
person of Allan Dulles, asked NSA to review the exhibits for any
secret writings or codes which might have been contained in the
documents. It also appears that NSA searched records for information
on the basis of other Warren Commission requests made informally
by Alien Dulies.

3. November 1975 Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

In response to an SSC request on the Assassination,
NSA reviewed its Soviet and Cuban files, including Cuban military.
The search was also for material involving Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby
or Earl Ruby (a Harvest run was made). Mexican traffic was also
reviewed, looking for information concerning Oswald's visit to
Mexico.

of President John F. Kennedy, NSA again searched the files.
Strongbox searches were made on the following:

Lee Harvey Oswald 1966 1976
Assassination of
President Kennedy 1966 1976
Earl Ruby 1966 1977
Cobo Cleaners 1966 1977

5. December 1976 Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
gence (SSCI) Requested all the material we had available on the
Cuban agent problem, It consisted of 485 reports for the period
1961 1965. All of these reports were received by Committee
Staff Members.

5. March 1978 House Select Committee on Assassination:
Requested all data on Cuban intelligence network and other materia.
relating to the Assassination. All Cuban agent material (1961
was reviewed, as was material that had been previously compiled to
respond to the SSCI and SSC requests.

B. As a result of the reviews described above, the following
materials which may have some relevance to the assassination were
located (referenced material inclosed at numbered tabs):

1. Four Cuban diplomatic messages which contained
official Cuban comments regarding press items that discussed Oswald'
activity in late September 1963 to obtain a visa to travel to
Moscow. There were also comments on the assassination itself.
The messages are dated in the last week of November 1963.

2. Three Cuban military reports which show that Cuban
military forces did go on alert immediately after the assassination.

3. One 1962 Cuban Intelligence) message concerning the
assassination of Antonio Veciana. This message was to (Puerto
Rico) SERAFIN.

4. One 1966 Cuban Diplomatic message concerning a Spanish
diplomaty in Cuba. It referenced a 1960 plan in Cuba to assassinate
an USSR dignitary in Cuba and against Raul Castro Ruz, possibly
linking it to the CIA.

5. Information in an FBI document relating to a French
Intelligence agent was supplied by NSA. Because this document
was to be turned over to the HASC, there may be some relation
to the assassination.

6. One 1967 message showing Cuban interest in Jim
Garrison's investigation of both the Kennedy Assassination and
David W. Ferrie.

CONFIDENTIAL

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
ATTN: Mr. Arthur Kerns, Intelligence Division

SUBJECT: Request for Information

1. Attached is correspondence which Lt Col Paul T. Fisher,
Chief, Security Police, U.S. Air Force Security Service, has re-
quested this Agency to bring to the attention of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation. The materials consist of a letter written by one
David Christensen, a former U.S. Air Force Security Service member,
to a former colleague of Mr. Christensen's who passed it on to the
Air Force Security Service. Also enclosed is Lt Col Fisher's cover
letter to Mr. James Leer of this Agency. Finally, since the photo-
copy of Mr. Christensen's handwritten letter is difficult to read,
a typewritten copy has been prepared for your convenience.

2. The classification markings on the handwritten letter
were applied by the Air Force Security Service. The typewritten
version has been classified CONFIDENTIAL HVCCO, the highest level
affixed to the handwritten letter.

3. Should you feel it appropriate to disseminate the enclosed
materials to any Committee of the Congress, I would ask that you do
so only to members or to staffers who have appropriate SI clear-
ances. The information contained in Mr. Christensen's letter
that the Air Force Security Service was intercepting international
commercial communications at Kirknewton, Scotland during 1963 is
correct, as is the assertion that that station monitored co-
cations links between Lisbon and other parts of the world..

DirNSA/M5 (Mr Lear)
Ft George G Meade, MD 20755:

Dear Jim

I am forwarding a letter from a former Security Service member to you.
It was furnished to us by the recipient, through his commander, at one
of our subordinate units.

After realizing the implications, true or otherwise, we immediately
notified our unit commander to turn it over to the OSI in Florida,
believing they would contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
since the writer is a civilian now.

Yesterday, this office was contacted by an OSI agent at Lowry AFB, CO;
this agent happens to be an ex-Security Service man. He was instructed
by his headquarters to interview the writer of the letter to determine
the names of other individuals he had contacted. Apparently: Mr. Christen-
sen has a long history of alcoholism, family problems and now wants to
see a \"cleared psychiatrist\" as he attributes all of his problems from
Oct 1963, per the OSI agent. In addition, he has indicated to the OS1
that he now fears for his life.

I am furnishing this to you as I feel the implication in the letter
should best be handled at the national level and that you are in the
best position to contact the Bureau. I have no knowledge that OSI has
not done this, but in view of the fact the subject was interviewed as
a civilian by an AF agent, rather than an FBI agent, leads me to doubt
this. In addition, you are in a much better position to determine where
the nearest psychiatrist, with access, is located. For your information,
we placed the classification markings on the letter.

We were told by Mr. Coombs, the OSI agent at OSI District 14, that the
doctor to contact at the VA hospital in Cheyenne, WY is a Dr Sedel,
commercial telephone number 778-7550, extension 273.

Nick,

Well after 13 1/2 years I finally found out your whereabouts, Dam, its
been a long time since Kirknewton, Scotland, and the beer we drank on the
beach and the club. Had to get your address from the outfit in Texas.

Nick, whatever happened to Sgt Prater? If you know his whereabouts please
send me his address. How in the hell have you been doing?

Nick, I had a nervous breakdown. Plus in 74 my leg shattered in over a
hundred places. Things have really gone to hell for me. I'm working with
the vets benefits counseler, who is a ex 203. Speaking of 203's where the hell
is Frenchy? You know the little guy. What I'm going to say is no longer
classified, so don't get all shit shook. I've done checked it out.

Christ, you remember the position I worked at, in Sgt Praters section, don't
you? You remember about a month or 6 weeks before I left Scotland, when I picked
up a link mentioning the assassination of President Kennedy. How hard I tried
to get it sent out, and because of that fuckin Forney and Delaughter they wouldn'
send it to NSA. Since I have learned that the man's name, most mentioned was
number 4 in a certain branch of organized crime at the time. Was number 2 last
year. I will send you a form for proof of claim. This guy here \"the 203\" says
I should be getting a service connected disability for my nerves. The \"link was\"
Lisbon to Tangiers you remember. How I got my ass chewed for not dropping the
link. Have learned that this branch of crime often will put out a feeler, of
forthcoming things. By sending it as a practice message.

Nick it really broke me up after Nov. 22, 63. Especially when I had it all
before hand. It was first like the 202's said, Ha. I was nuts when the Russians
first came out with the ITI & B's. Later proved them wrong didn't I. That was
another first for us as I recall. Duane Bruntz from Baker trick put up a good
support of my claim. I'm sending you this certified so to make sure you get it.
As I recall you should be able to B.S. them good enough to help me. I know it
cost me a divorce and every thing from my wife. Christ, you remember Marlene,
don't you? That good looking little 1/2 Indian girl from N. Dak. Nick when
you get this form send it back to me and I'll let the vets benefits guy to send
it in. Being a M.Sgt I think you know how to bull shit pretty good. Also do
you know Sgt Harley and Sgt Willy Hendrickson's address. I guess old Garnett K.
Tatum retired. Wonder what gehto, he is living in, Ha!

Mr. David Marwell
Assassination Records Review Board
600 E Street NW, 2nd Floor
Washington, DC 20530

Dear Mr. Marwell:

(FOUO) In response to your letter of March 9, 1995 we tasked appropriate elements of
NSA Operations and Archives as well as the Legislative Affairs Office (LAO) and Office of
General Counsel (OGC) to search for information responsive to your questions. The following
represents the composite response of these elements.

(U) \"What technical capabilities did NSA have during the early 1960's for collecting,
deciphering, and analyzing communications?\"

(TS-CCO) NSA had an excellent capability to meet the SIGINT challenges of the 1960's. We
had field sites in position to copy the signals of interest in the USSR, both High Frequency and
Line-of-Sight, in Cuba, and those communications exchanged internationally between coun-
tries. We accomplished this through a mixture of fixed sites manned by armed forces personnel,
airborne and shipborne platforms, exchanges with Second and Third Parties, and clandestine and
special sources. We exploited many enciphered communications of interest, but not Soviet dip-
lomatic and agent communications and those of a few other countries that employed very sophis-
ticated cryptosystems. Our analytic capabilities were excellent, both in our civilian and military
workforce.

(U) \"What COMINT did NSA actually intercept during the early 1960's from the Soviet
Union, Cuba, and Mexico, from organized crime or international drug smugglers?\"

(TS-CCO) NSA produced COMINT on many facets of the Soviet target, from leadership com-
munications to military command and control, from scientific and technical research and devel-
opment to international trade and industrial endeavors, exploiting many low-to-medium grade
cipher systems on these targets. On the Cuban target, we produced many products on all facets
as well, from military command and control to international trade, from domestic industrial and
agricultural endeavors to diplomatic and agent communications. We also produced product on
Mexican targets, mainly diplomatic and military. There were no reflections in any of these prod-
ucts of any activity that might have been related to the assassination, only post-assassination re-
flections of U.S. political and protocol developments and Cuban releases of statements denying
crime or narcotics smuggling at that time. One organization did follow international arms trade
activity and issued product reports, but there was nothing to tie any of their reporting to the as-
sassination.

(U) \"What actions did NSA take in the immediate wake of President Kennedy's assas-
sination? For example, did any agency task NSA to perform any functions regarding the assas-
sination? Was any task force, group directorate, or other entity at NSA formed or charged with
any responsibilities for collecting information that in any way pertained to the assassination of
President Kennedy? Was any traffic analysis performed? Were any product reports produced?
Were there any TSRs?

(TS-CCO) Collectors, based on their personal recollections, were alerted to put greater empha-
sis on Soviet Bloc and Cuban military targets to look for signs of increased readiness in their
force posture. Analysts at NSA were also looking for signs of diplomatic reactions to and for-
eign intelligence reporting on the assassination. Any voice and cipher traffic were thoroughly
processed from the surrounding timeframe. Analysts on targets that were unexploitable from a
cryptanalytic standpoint reviewed traffic patterns to ensure that no deviations indicating unusual
activity had been overlooked.

(U) \"Did NSA ever collect, isolate, or segregate any records relating to the assassina-
tion?\"

(FOUO) One file, related to Lee Harvey Oswald, was accessioned into the NSA/CSS Archives
in 1986. The LAO holds five files that topically relate in some way to the Assassination. In
1993 NSA searched for and collected documents in response to Public Law 102-526. Copies of
the records responsive to the law are held in the Office of Policy.

(U) \"What actions has NSA taken, since 1964, with respect to the assassination? For
example, other than with respect to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), has
NSA had any program to collect any data with respect to the assassination?\"

(FOUO) Since 1964 NSA has answered queries from various congressional committees. Files
about the information provided are held by the LAO and OGC. NSA's only program to collect
data related to the assassination was the response to PL. 102-526.

(U) \"What files or records has NSA ever had pertaining to congressional investigations
of the assassination or the intelligence community? For example, are there (or were there) NSA
files on the Warren Commission, the HSCA, the Church Committee, the Pike Committee, etc.\"

(FOUO) The LAO, OGC and Archives holds files related to this question covering all of the
topics except the Warren Commission.

(U) \"What records retention (and records destruction) policies has NSA ever proposed
or implemented that might have affected records pertaining to the assassination? You stated, for
example, that records identifying Americans were destroyed in the wake of the Church Commit-
tee investigation, and you suggested that records identifying Oswald might have been among
those destroyed. What were the destruction orders; who implemented them; how many records
were destroyed; and how were records identified for destruction?\"

(FOUO) NSA has created records disposition schedules for some documents. However,
SIGINT records disposition remained predominantly unscheduled during the period in question,
and consequently their handling is uncertain. Serialized records (reports) are usually retained
intact and are preserved to this day. The retention or destruction of other types of records were
not handled systematically. The decision to retain or destroy was made by the originating ele-
ments.

(U) \"What records from intercepts involving the Soviet Union, the Soviet Bloc, Cuba,
and Mexico from the early 1960's are still extant? For example, does NSA have untranscribed
Cuban tapes from 1963 (but that may subsequently have been broken)? What records does NSA
have from the Bay of Pigs and from the Cuban Missile Crisis?

(S-CCO) There are end-product reports, code books on target communications and cipher traf-
fic available dating from the early 1960's on these targets in the NSA archives. Our records
show no instances of codes being broken in which we did not go back and decrypt traffic from

the period that had been unexploitable at the time. It is our standard practice to do so regardless
of the circumstances. When such events occur it is also the SIGINT modus operandi to ensure
all voice material having any possible connectivity whatsoever to the event is scanned for intelli-
gence purposes. We found no indications of any SIGINT collection that did not get reviewed.
Such records also cover the missile crisis and Bay of Pigs timeframes as well. There has been an
historical perspective written in 1984-85 on the SIGINT effort during the Missile Crisis that also
touches on the Bay of Pigs, and one is planned on the Assassination (no estimated completion
date).

(U) \"Does NSA have files on American defectors to Communist countries during the
late 1950's and early 1960's?\"

(TS CCO) There was one NSA organization which, as part of their mission, tracked the activi-
ties of such individuals in the 1960's, first manually and later by machine. However, almost all
records of such endeavors and files were destroyed in 1974, and any such activity ceased in the
wake of the Church and Pike Committees' reports on such activities and the subsequent Execu-
tive Order issued. The two exceptions to this would be files on Martin and Mitchell who were
employees of NSA.

(U) \"Did any foreign government or intelligence service ever supply NSA with any in-
formation pertaining to the assassination?\"

(FOUO) We are unaware of any information of this subject ever being passed by any foreign
government or intelligence service to NSA.

(FOUO) We have also collected a list of personnel who were working the target at the
time or who have contributed to these answers. After you have reviewed these responses, please
do not hesitate to contact us to on (301) 688-6798 with any questions which you have.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
28 November 1978
SUBJECT: Visit to House Select Committee on Assassinations

1. On 21 November I visited House Select Committee on Assassinations
spaces to review for classification purposes the report Messrs Cornwell
and Klein wrote following the 17 November interview with Sgt Nicholas B.
Stevenson, USAF.

2. The report, about one and a half pages long, listed the participants
in the interview and described generally the substance of the discussions.
Although it did not mention the specific site to which Sgt Stevenson and
Mr. Christensen were assigned, it did say that the facility was able to
collect the Lisbon-Tangier link. The report further mentioned \"intercept\"
and \"NSA\" in several places.

3. I told Mr. Cornwell that as written, portions of the report should
be classified \"CONFIDENTIAL, HANDLE VIA COMINT CHANNELS ONLY.\" He agreed
to classify it and asked me to mark it which I did. I suggested that with
a few changes we could make it unclassified. Mr. Cornwell stated that he
would prefer to retain the original language of the report at this time
but that if it was to be used in any unclassified report by the Committee,
he would then ask us to review the wording so that classified information
would not be disclosed.

4. Mr. Cornwell asked if NSA had determined whether the conversation
Mr. Christensen referenced had been published and disseminated in product
channels. I told him that we had not yet determined the answer to that
question and that we would be back in touch.

since it deals with crimes that have been committed and activities
that have been carried out against the integrity and stability
of the state by Mr. JAIME CALDEVILLA Y GARCIA VILLAR, Press
Counselor of the Spanish Embassy, who intolerably abused the
diplomatic immunity and privileges granted him and used them
for purposes, like those cited, that are very different from the
functions assigned to him.

\"With the purpose of documenting what has already been
indicated, I take the liberty of informing you below in detail, of
the charges which have been brought against Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA,
proved in an authentic and irrefutable manner, and which compel
us to formally and expressly request his immediate departure from
the country persona non grata.

\"The main activites of Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA are
directed toward the search, by illicit means, for information of a

military, economic and political nature, the fulfillment of tasks
of ideological diversionism and the recruitment of agents and
counterrevolutionaries for the Central Intelligence Agency, tasks
in which he has availed himself of the very close collaboration of
his secretary, Miss CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ((A)).

\"Since February 1959, Counselor CALDEVILLA has undertaken the
job of recruiting members of the then Rebel Army, among them the
traitor ALDO VERA ((A)), MARIO MARRERO((A)), and AGUSTIN PARRADA((A)).
The latter, once his activities were discovered, found it propitious
to flee the country to avoid prosecution.

\"Along this same line, he also used the aforementioned Miss
CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ, instructing her to infiltrate student
organizations for the purpose of creating diversionism in the
ideological order, and she established, for this purpose, intimate
relations with Mr. PEDRO LUIS BOITELL((A)), ex-President of the

arrested and sentenced to imprisonment on the Isle of Pines,
Miss JIMENEZ GOMEZ went there and carried out military and political
espionage activities. The data and information that she obtained
on that occasion were transmitted to Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA,
and included microfilms.

\"In February 1960 Counselor CALDEVILLA conceived a plan for
an attempt against the life of the then First Deputy Chairman of
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mr. ANASTAS MΙΚΟΥΑΝ,,
a guest in Cuba, for which purpose he delivered arms to a group
of counterrevolutionarly elements. It was not executed, according
to what Counselor CALDEVILLA himself claims, because of the
cowardice of the assassins, He also sought refuge and protection in
the home of his collaborator JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ((A)), for Mr. ISRAEL
ZAMORA PEREZ((A)), a fugitive from Cuban authorities for plotting
an attempt against the life of the Vice Prime Minister and Minister
of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, Commander RAUL CASTRO RUZ,

as well as a plan to create an incident at the United States Naval
Base at Guantanamo. Later, Counselor CALDEVILLA arranged for the
mentioned ISRAEL ZAMORA PEREZ to take asylum in the Colombian
Embassy in Havana.

\"In May 1962 he instructed his agents CARMEN JIMENEZ GARCIA
and ALFREDO SERRA ECHEVARRIA((A)), an accountant at the Embassy, as
well as other individuals, to infiltrate different organizations
and offices of the Cuban State. The former went to work in the
offices of the National College of Architects, where she established
contacts with numerous professionals to induce them to desert, as
well as to obtain data and information from the Congress of the
International Union of Architects, where she worked as a simultaneous
interpreter.

for the counterrevolutionary organization, the Revolutionary
Student Directorate with which he maintained close relations
through BLANCA MARTINEZ DEL HOYO ((A)), JORGE MEDINA BRINGUIER((A)),
and LUIS FERNANDEZ ROCHA((A)). The first two were national coordinators
for civic resistance and strengthening of the Revolutionary Student
Directorate, and the latter, a CIA agent.

\"It has also been proved that Counselor CALDEVILLA's wife,

political prisoners and counterrevolutionaries, inciting them to
send letters of protest to foreign embassies and international
organizations.

to recruit him and give him training in arms and explosives, even
within the Spanish Embassy, and instruct him in organizing an
espionage network for the illicit procurement of military, economic
and political information and in penetrating the Cuban-Spanish
Friendship Society, whose building he was to occupy in the event
the United States Government launched an armed aggression against
Cuba. He was to be given arms and equipment at the opportune

to distribute arms and relay guidance to counterrevolutionary
groups in the event of this aggression. The espionage ring organized
by the aforementioned is made up of eight persons who receive for said

Miami bank.

Ministries of the Sugar Industry, Industries, Foreign Trade and

as well as a plan and a report with specifications on the type of
arms, location, and personnel of the military installations of Managua
and Matanzas which were delivered by LUIS ANTONIO COLLAZO DENNISN((A)),

\"In April 1963, when the Achives was pentrated by CIA agent
RAMON GRAU ALSIN((A)) who directed an espionage ring, a note was
found which confirmed that a certain message had been delivered to
Counselor CALDEVILLA. In June of the same year, photostatic copies
of the motions of the Student Congress on the Struggle of Peoples
Against Colonialism were delivered to him by CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ.

Both were exposed by leaders of counterrevolutionary organizations,
having offered, on one occasion, to supply to one group rifles
with telescopic sights. The authorities have proof that one or
the other maintains relations with the well-known counterrevolutionary
leader MANUEL ARTIME, whom Mr. VERGARA visited in Miami sometime
before the mercenary invasion was crushed at Playa Giron, in
April 1961, with the knowledge of Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA.

\"It has been known that Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA has been
dedicated, furthermore, for some time, to the illegal removal from
the country through the diplomatic pouches of the Spanish Embassy
of jewels and foreign currency delivered to him by different persons,
on a basis of 20 percent of its value. In this way, the removal
from the country of the possessions of ALVARO GONZALEZ GORDON((A))
and his wife MARIA TERESA VELASCO SARRA((A)) was facilitated.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Subject: Response to Congressional Query

1. On 9 November 1978, G8 began a search for material to answer an inquiry
by the House Assassinations Committee referred to us by NSA's Legislative Affairs
Office (LAO). An individual assigned to the USAFSS intercept station in Kirknewton,
Scotland (USA-55) in 1963 reportedly intercepted an ILC message containing informa-
tion relative to an assassination plot against President John F. Kennedy. He claims
he intercepted this message, but was not allowed to disseminate the content. The
Committee is seeking to determine if this intercept actually occurred and has asked
NSA to check product and files for pertinent intercept and reporting from USA-55 during
1963.

2. Though it seems unlikely that such a message ever existed, the following
actions have been taken in response to the House Committee request:

a. A records check was conducted in concert with N33 (Mr. Carrol Baldwin).
There was no material which was identified in the records index as relevant; however,
there were three boxes of material dated 1963 containing unidentified material. These
three boxes were opened and were found to contain the following:

1) Two boxes contained audio tapes with accompanying gists and logs
from USASA intercept sites along the German/Czechoslovakia border (USM-42 sites).
The intercept was identified as CKMS (Czechoslovak Army Voice communications) dated
1961.

2) The other box contained International Commercial Traffic passing
between the Soviet Union and Cuba. This material was largely from the Naval Security
Group Activity at Sabena Seca, Puerto Rico (USN-19) and was dated in 1962.

b. A few personnel currently at NSA had experience during 1963 with ILC
intercept policies and procedures at Kirknewton and at NSA. Several of them were
questioned, and recalled that an ILC mission did exist at Kirknewton in the 1963 time-
frame, that all traffic was forwarded to NSA, and that all reporting of ILC messages
was done at NSA.

3. On 21 November LAO asked that we also check those records available labeled
1964, because the 1963 dated boxes contained material from 1962 rather than 1963.
Further, we were asked if product for the 1963 period was available, if USA-55 material
used in the product could be identified, and how much of an effort would determining
this entail. We have checked the records for 1964 and find no boxes which we feel
should be examined. The contents of all boxes are clearly identified and none relate
to ILC intercept, and there are none whose contents are not identified.

4. As noted earlier the product from ILC intercept historically has been reported
by NSA. This product is available in T14, but there is no practical way to isolate that
which was derived from USA-55. It is possible to scan 1963 (QOC) product and it is the
T142 estimate that this would require a minimum of four weeks to scan the some 9,900
such products on file for the period from January through November 1963. G8 did not
request a search of these records, pending further word from LAO.

FROM : LAO DATE: 15 June 1978.

SUBJECT: HCSA Request for NSA Material on Kennedy Assassination

1. Based on our discussion with Judy Miller, my understanding was that
Mr. Blakey's most recent request for data from NSA involved a review of
post-assassination diplomatic product on a world-wide basis to determine
if reports relevant to the assassination exist. Though Ms. Miller did
not specify a time period, a three month period subsequent to the event
would involve as an example six to nine thousand reports and would
require 120 to 150 hours of analyst time just to conduct a manual search
of the microfilm files where these records reside.

2. I subsequently spoke with Mr. Roger Denk, DIA, who had actually
participated in the briefing of Mr. Blakey, using our SECRET-level statement
as a basis. Mr. Denk advises that DIA has destroyed all its files which
might relate to the assassination and that, therefore, he had had nothing
to offer Blakey except the NSA-prepared sanitized statement. Mr. Denk also
provided a different, much more ambitious new requirement from Blakey than
that reported by Judy Miller.

3. According to Denk, what Blakey really wants from NSA is for us to
conduct a thorough review of all Cuban communications during the six year
period from January 1959 to December 1964, in order to see \"what the Cubans
were talking about/thinking about\" of possible relevance to the assassina-
tion a real fishing expedition in my view. Blakey is also reported to
desire a \"characterization of the traffic\"
and not the traffic itself.

4. This latest version of Blakey's interests, which has probably
been stated to us fairly accurately by Denk, represents a very significant
work load indeed. Based on some very educated estimates made by the
people in T12 who maintain the historical microfilm files, there were
approximately 200,000 Cuban reports or translations issued during the six
year period of interest, and roughly 2,000 man-hours of effort would be
required to search these records for items of interest.

5. As we have discussed previously, I believe that NSA in a number
of separate, thorough analytic efforts has performed reasonable and
detailed reviews of all available signals intelligence. None of these
reviews has resulted in the derivation of any data of direct significance
to the assassination. A summary of these separate NSA efforts is attached.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 15 June 1978
SUBJECT: Actions Taken by NSA to Locate Information Related
to the Assassination of President Kennedy

A. Over the past fourteen and one-half years, NSA has
performed a number of separate in-depth reviews of materials in
its files in an attempt to isolate data that might be relevant
to the assassination of President Kennedy. Nothing of significance
has been determined as a result of those reviews.

1. November-December 1963 Immediately after the
assassination, NSAinitiated a large-scale manual and machine
review of available SIGINT, including all U.S./Cuba traffic. (NSA
intercepted messages at an average of 1,000 per day at that time).
A computer search was initiated using Oswald's name as the minimum
for research criteria. Additionally, all traffic between Cuba/New
Orleans and Cuba/Dallas was manually reviewed (an analyst involved
recalled that 25 to 50 analysts reviewed the traffic manually,
along with traffic from Cuba and some Soviet traffic). Sometime
during the search, items from the Oswald address book provided by
the FBI were added to the search criteria.

2. 1964 Warren Commission The Commission, in the
person of Allan Dulles, asked NSA to review the exhibits for any
secret writings or codes which might have been contained in the
documents. It also appears that NSA searched records for information
on the basis of other Warren Commission requests made informally
by Allen Dulles.

3. November 1975 Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC):

In response to an SSC request on the Assassination,
NSA reviewed its Soviet and Cuban files, including Cuban military.
The search was also for material involving Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby
or Earl Ruby (a Harvest run was made). Mexican traffic was also
reviewed, looking for information concerning Oswald's visit to
Mexico.

material relating to Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination

of President John F. Kennedy, NSA again searched the files.
Strongbox searches were made on the following:

Lee Harvey Oswald 1966 1976
Assassination of
President Kennedy 1966 1976
Earl Ruby 1966 1977
Cobo Cleaners 1966 1977

5.
-
December 1976
Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
gence (SSCI) Requested all the material we had available on the
Cuban agent problem. It consisted of 485 reports for the period
1961 1965. All of these reports were received by Committee
Staff Members.

6. March 1978 House Select Committee on Assassinations -
Requested all data on Cuban intelligence network and other materials
relating to the Assassination. All Cuban agent material (1961 1964).
was reviewed, as was material that had been previously compiled to
respond to the SSCI and SSC requests.

B. As a result of the reviews described above, the following
materials which may have some relevance to the assassination were
located (referenced material inclosed at numbered tabs):

1. Four Cuban diplomatic messages which contained
official Cuban comments regarding press items that discussed Oswald's
activity in late September 1963 to obtain a visa to travel to
Moscow. There were also comments on the assassination itself.
The messages are dated in the last week of November 1963.

2. Three Cuban military reports which show that Cuban
military forces did go on alert immediately after the assassination.

3. One 1962 Cuban Intelligence message concerning the
assassination of Antonio Veciana. This message was to (Puerto
Rico) SERAFIN.

4. One 1966 Cuban Diplomatic message concerning a Spanish
diplomat in Cuba. It referenced a 1960 plan in Cuba to assassinate
an USSR dignitary in Cuba and against Raul Castro Ruz, possibly
linking it to the CIA.

5. Information in an FBI document relating to a French
Intelligence agent was supplied by NSA. Because this document
was to be turned over to the HASC, there may be some relation
to the assassination.

6. One 1967 message showing Cuban interest in Jim
Garrison's investigation of both the Kennedy Assassination and
David W. Ferrie.

their own president. They sent OSWALD to Mexico to request

MINREX, HAVANA VERIFIES OSWALD'S REQUEST FOR TRANSIT VISA FOR RUSSIA

FR Havana: MINREX 26 Nov 63

Msg Nr: 7482

MINREX reported yesterday that the information in the newspaper
Excelcior of Mexico City concerning LEE OSWALD's request for a transit
visa to go to the USSR, which was requested from the Cuban Consulate
in Merida, is true. This visa was requested 27 September from said
consulate, which stated that it could not grant the visa without
permission of MINREX, and unless permission had been granted pre-
viously by the country of destination. OSWALD gave up annoying the
consulate, and the visa was never granted.

This detail, and others, confirm the suspicion that the KENNEDY
assassination was a provocation against world peace by the most re-
actionary sectors. It is evident that these sectors planned

demonstrates the scandalous means which reactionary forces are
using in the United States to cover up the perpetrators and the
motives for KENNEDY's assassination. World-wide public opinion
demands a clarification of the facts. It is absurd that the Dallas

ALERT IN ORIENTE PROVINCE BELIEVED TO BE TERMINATED

The alert in Oriente Province (see 2/0/CUN/R196-63) is be-
lieved to be terminated. The alert, apparently prompted by
President KENNEDY's death on 22 November, was possibly pre-
scheduled to terminate on 25 November. There have been two orders
which suggest that the alert was destined to be concluded on
25 November; they are:

1) Access to the Coastal Observation Post at Punta
Maisi (20-15N 74-09W) was restricted until 25 November because
of the alert (see 2/QS/CUN/R667-63); and

2) Subordinates of Banes, Headquarters Eastern Naval
District, were to receive further orders on the 25th, presumably
concerning their alert status (2/0/CUN/R196-63); no such orders
have been noted in communications.

There have been no further references in intercepted communi-
cations to the alert since 02222 on 23 November (2/QS/CUN/R667-63).

It is possible that the restricted access to the Observation
Post at Punta Maisi extends to other Observation Posts in Oriente
Province such as reported on 23 November when First Army Coastal
Observation Posts were placed in an alert status
(2/LR1/CUM/R188-63), and that the restriction was to be lifted on
25 November by all those posts.

Further indication that the alert has terminated is the fact
that the Cuban Navy was engaged in an island-wide communications
exercise on 25 November. It is considered unlikely that such an
exercise would be conducted under alert conditions.

There have been no further references to the alert status
of the (D percent Santiago de Cuba) units which was first ob-
served on 23 November (2/SL/CUA/R05-63). All CRAF and Soviet
Forces Cuba communications appear to be normal during this
period, 22-26 November 1963.

ALERCE IN EASTERN NAVAL DISTRICT RETAINED, 23 NOVEMBER
As a result of the death of President KENNEDY, the Eastern
Naval District of Cuba was placed on alert at 2044Z
22 November by Bamsa, headquarters for that district,((A))

At 2237Z on 23 November, the alert was relaxed a certain
degree by Bamsa, instructions were passed to Santiago de Cuba,
a, subordinate, to give leave to 25 percent of their personnel
for the 23rd and 24th and that further orders would be forthcoming
on 25 November 1963.

The instructions to grant leave to personnel to a
25% indicates that the alert is somewhat relaxed and
the note that further instructions would be issued on
Tuesday, 25 November, indicates that a decision was
to be made regarding the Eastern Naval District.

All subordinates of the First Army Headquarters in both
Eastern and Southwestern Oriente were placed in an alert status
at 23202 on 22 November 1963 (2/LRL/COM/R187-63).

The urgent need of food at the Pilon (probably 19-58-
77-198) Coastal Battalion was revealed in a message from the
Chief, South Sector, Sierra Maestra Headquarters, Pilon, to Chief
of Services, First Army Headquarters, on 25 November 1963
(2/LRL/COM/T668-63).

PART III B: (CUBAN NAVAL COMMUNICATIONS)

One of the KOMAR-class PGM's, the 10-250, has suffered one
of the first accidents involving a KOMAR vessel in Cuba. At
approximately 08302 on 26 November the 10-250 ran aground while
entering the port of Mariel, sustaining uncontrollable leaks.
Salvage vessels sent to the scene included the GC-59, BO-11,
and LV-28; they were estimated to have worked until 22152, when
it was reported salvage operations were complete (2/QS/CUM/2679-63
and 2/LRL/COM/R135-63). The 10-250 is now in drydock, presumably
at Mariel (2/QS/CUM/R595-63).

A Cuban steamship named the INDALECIO was forced by passengers
to put into the Guantanamo Naval Base on 26 November. Four persons
aboard the vessel were reported to have taken asylum at the base but
a reliable collateral source states that 15 persons remained at the
base and four others returned with the INDALECIO. The vessel was
escorted by a destroyer to the canal leading to Caimanera
(19-59-75-09W) from the Naval Base (2/LRL/CUM/R190, 186-63 and
2/QS/CUM/R681-63). A later report disclosed that 12 passengers and
5 crewmen, including the ship's captain, remained at the Guantanamo
Naval Base (2/LRL/M/3291-63).

An alert which began on 22 November in Oriente Province was
apparently prompted by the death of President KENNEDY. While no
orders or directives have been noted canceling the alert, there
were indications that it probably was to terminate on 25 November.
On 25 November instructions were passed from Banas to a subordi-
nate unit that leaves will be granted to 25 percent of its
personnel (2/0/3/856-63 and 2/QS/CUN/R196-63).

The USNS JOSEPH E. MULLER, TAC-171, has been the subject
of recurring Cuban reports concerning its position. These re-
ports have been noted being passed from Havana to Cabanas, the
KOMAR-class PGM Headquarters. The reports were first noted in
September and have continued until November (2/0/CUN/R195-63).

The Cabanas Naval Base was informed on 23 November by Naval
Headquarters in Havana that there would be exercises scheduled
from 23 to 30 November in the Key West area by U.S. aircraft;
exercises would include pyrotechnical and lateral firing,
ground firing and illumination practices. The information was
reported to have been obtained by \"our sources.\" These sources
were not identified (2/LL/CUN/R30-63).

that have been carried out against the integrity and stability
of the state by Mr. JAIME CALDEVILLA Y GARCIA VILLAR, Press

diplomatic immunity and privileges granted him and used them

of ideological diversionism and the recruitment of agents and
counterrevolutionaries for the Central Intelligence Agency, tasks
in which he has availed himself of the very close collaboration of
his secretary, Miss CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ((A)).

\"Since February 1959, Counselor CALDEVILLA has undertaken the
job of recruiting members of the then Rebel Army, among them the
traitor ALDO VERA ((A)), MARIO MARRERO((A)), and AGUSTIN PARRADA((A)).
The latter, once his activities were discovered, found it propitious
to flee the country to avoid prosecution.

\"Along this same line, he also used the aforementioned Miss
CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ, instructing her to infiltrate student
organizations for the purpose of creating diversionism in the
ideological order, and she established, for this purpose, intimate
relations with Mr. PEDRO LUIS BOITELL((A)), ex-President of the

arrested and sentenced to imprisonment on the Isle of Pines,
Miss JIMENEZ GOMEZ went there and carried out military and political
espionage activities. The data and information that she obtained
on that occasion were transmitted to Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA,
and included microfilms.

\"In February 1960 Counselor CALDEVILLA conceived a plan for
an attempt against the life of the then First Deputy Chairman of
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mr. ANASTAS MIKOYAN,,
a guest in Cuba, for which purpose he delivered arms to a group
of counterrevolutionarly elements. It was not executed, according
to what Counselor CALDEVILLA himself claims, because of the
cowardice of the assassins, He also sought refuge and protection in
the home of his collaborator JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ ((A)), for Mr. ISRAEL
ZAMORA PEREZ((A)), a fugitive from Cuban authorities for plotting
an attempt against the life of the Vice Prime Minister and Minister
of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, Commander RAUL CASTRO RUZ,

mentioned ISRAEL ZAMORA PEREZ to take asylum in the Colombian
Embassy in Havana.
:
\"In May 1962 he instructed his agents CARMEN JIMENEZ GARCIA
and ALFREDO SERRA ECHEVARRIA((A)), an accountant at the Embassy, as
well as other individuals, to infiltrate different organizations
and offices of the Cuban State. The former went to work in the
offices of the National College of Architects, where she established
contacts with numerous professionals to induce them to desert, as
well as to obtain data and information from the Congress of the
International Union of Architects, where she worked as a simultaneous
interpreter.

correspondence with instructions, received by diplomatic pouch,
for the counterrevolutionary organization, the Revolutionary
Student Directorate with which he maintained close relations
through BLANCA MARTINEZ DEL HOYO((A)), JORGE MEDINA BRINGUIER((A)),
and LUIS FERNANDEZ ROCHA((A)). The first two were national coordinators
for civic resistance and strengthening of the Revolutionary Student
Directorate, and the latter, a CIA agent.

\"It has also been proved that Counselor CALDEVILLA's wife,
at his suggestion, has maintained relations with relatives of
political prisoners and counterrevolutionaries, inciting them to
send letters of protest to foreign embassies and international
organizations.

to recruit him and give him training in arms and explosives, even
within the Spanish Embassy, and instruct him in organizing an
espionage network for the illicit procurement of military, economic
and political information and in penetrating the Cuban-Spanish
Friendship Society, whose building he was to occupy in the event
the United States Government launched an armed aggression against
Cuba. He was to be given arms and equipment at the opportune
moment. In like manner FOLGUEIRAS was instructed by the former
to distribute arms and relay guidance to counterrevolutionary
groups in the event of this aggression. The espionage ring organized
by the aforementioned is made up of eight persons who receive for said
task the amount of 250,00 US dollars monthly and the promise of

Counselor CALDEVILLA attempted to obtain the names and activities
of the delegates, guests, and journalists attending, as well as
reports on its development and agreements.

\"In February 1966, he gave refuge in his residency to counter-...
revolutionary fugitive ALDO ABREU BACALLAO((A)), a convicted saboteur.

\"The Cuban authorities have also learned through the statements
of several arrested persons, that Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA uses the
pouches and enciphered Embassy cables to receive and transmit
instructions, reports, requests for information, and correspondence
related to illicit activities and is personally in charge of
deciphering messages in an office on the second floor of the chancery,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 28 November 1978

SUBJECT: Visit to House Select Committee on Assassinations

1. On 21 November I visited House Select Committee on Assassinations
spaces to review for classification purposes the report Messrs Cornwell
and Klein wrote following the 17 November interview with Sgt Nicholas B.
Stevenson, USAF.

2. The report, about one and a half pages long, listed the participants
in the interview and described generally the substance of the discussions.
Although it did not mention the specific site to which Sgt Stevenson and
Mr. Christensen were assigned, it did say that the facility was able to
collect the Lisbon-Tangier link. The report further mentioned \"intercept\"
and \"NSA\" in several places.

3. I told Mr. Cornwell that as written, portions of the report should
be classified \"CONFIDENTIAL, HANDLE VIA COMINT CHANNELS ONLY.\" He agreed
to classify it and asked me to mark it which I did. I suggested that with
a few changes we could make it unclassified. Mr. Cornwell stated that he
would prefer to retain the original language of the report at this time
but that if it was to be used in any unclassified report by the Committee,
he would then ask us to review the wording so that classified information
would not be disclosed.

4. Mr. Cornwell asked if NSA had determined whether the conversation
Mr. Christensen referenced had been published and disseminated in product
channels. I told him that we had not yet determined the answer to that
question and that we would be back in touch.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 21 November 1978

SUBJECT: House Assassination Committee Inquiry

1. On 17 November 1978, Mike Smith, GC, and I attended an
interview conducted by staff members of the House Select Committee
on Assassinations in regard to the allegations of Mr. David F.
Christensen concerning the involvement of certain individuals in
the assassination of President Kennedy.

2. The interview was conducted by Messrs Kenneth Klein and
Gary Cornwell and was held in secure spaces provided by Mr. George
Murphy, Director of the Senate National Security Office. Both
individuals are authorized SI access.

3. The interview was conducted under terms of a Memorandum
of Understanding executed between the Committee and OSD on 15 November,
1978 (copy attached).

4. For purposes of the interview, DoD made available Sgt.
Nicholas B. Stevenson, USAF, who had been stationed with Mr.
Christensen at USA-55, Kirknewton, Scotland, in 1963. Sgt. Stevenson
was accompanied by LTC Jeffrey Graham, USAF, Air Force Legislative
Liaison.

5. The Committee staffers were interested primarily in Sgt.
Stevenson's recollections in regard to events described by Mr.
Christensen in a letter to Stevenson written in May 1978.

6. Sgt. Stevenson briefly described the USA-55 site HF ILC
mission and confirmed that the Lisbon-Tangier link mentioned in
Mr. Christensen's letter could have been intercepted by the site
but, to his knowledge, had not been an assigned target. Regarding
the specific allegations made by Mr. Christensen that he had per-
sonally intercepted communications relating to the President's
assassination, Sgt. Stevenson emphatically stated that he had no
knowledge of such an event, though in all likelihood, if it had
occurred, it would have been widely known within the station and
the probable subject of a CRITIC.

7. Mike's and my role in the interview was concentrated largely.
on interpreting SIGINT jargon and emphasing the fact that the sites'
mission was and remains properly classified CONFIDENTIAL-HANDLE VIA
COMINT CHANNELS.

8. The staffers made no notes and agreed to let us review their
report, for purposes of classification, on or after 20 November 1978.

9. The staffers remain particularly interested in determining
the name of the individual who Mr. Christensen believes relates to
the assassination. They will explore means of determining this
information to include the possibility of having Sgt. Stevenson
call Christensen and ask him for the identity (Stevenson indicated
his extreme unwillingness to do this. LTC Graham stated that this
request would have to be examined at policy level within DoD).

10. If the Committee is able to determine a specific name,
the staffers indicated that they would probably initiate a specific
inquiry to NSA to again search our materials.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
ATTN: Mr. Arthur Kerns, Intelligence Division

SUBJECT: Request for Information

1. Attached is correspondence which Lt Col Paul T. Fisher,
Chief, Security Police, U.S. Air Force Security Service, has re-
quested this Agency to bring to the attention of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation. The materials consist of a letter written by one
David Christensen, a former U.S. Air Force Security Service member,
to a former colleague of Mr. Christensen's who passed it on to the
Air Force Security Service. Also enclosed is Lt Col. Fisher's cover
letter to Mr. James Leer of this Agency. Finally, since the photo-
copy of Mr. Christensen's handwritten letter is difficult to read,
a typewritten copy has been prepared for your convenience.

2. The classification markings on the handwritten letter
were applied by the Air Force Security Service. The typewritten
version has been classified CONFIDENTIAL HVCCO, the highest level
affixed to the handwritten letter.

3. Should you feel it appropriate to disseminate the enclosed
materials to any Committee of the Congress, I would ask that you do
so only to members or to staffers who have appropriate SI clear-
ances. The information contained in Mr. Christensen's letter
that the Air Force Security Service was intercepting international
commercial communications at Kirknewton, Scotland during 1963 is
correct, as is the assertion that that station monitored communi-
cations links between Lisbon and other parts of the world.

Dear Jim

I am forwarding a letter from a former Security Service member to you.
It was furnished to us by the recipient, through his commander, at one
of our subordinate units.

After realizing the implications, true or otherwise, we immediately
notified our unit commander to turn it over to the OSI in Florida,
believing they would contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
since the writer is a civilian now.

Yesterday, this office was contacted by an OSI agent at Lowry AFB, CO;
this agent happens to be an ex-Security Service man. He was instructed
by his headquarters to interview the writer of the letter to determine
the names of other individuals he had contacted. Apparently Mr. Christen-
sen has a long history of alcoholism, family problems and now wants to
see a \"cleared psychiatrist\" as he attributes all of his problems from
Oct 1963, per the OSI agent. In addition, he has indicated to the OSI
that he now fears for his life.

I am furnishing this to you as I feel the implication in the letter
should best be handled at the national level and that you are in the
best position to contact the Bureau. I have no knowledge that OSI has
not done this, but in view of the fact the subject was interviewed as
a civilian by an AF agent, rather than an FBI agent, leads me to doubt
this. In addition, you are in a much better position to determine where
the nearest psychiatrist, with access, is located. For your information,
we placed the classification markings on the letter.

We were told by Mr. Coombs, the OSI agent at OSI District 14, that the
doctor to contact at the VA hospital in Cheyenne, WY is a Dr Sedel,
commercial telephone number 778-7550, extension 273.

Nick,

Well after 13 1/2 years I finally found out your whereabouts, Dam, its
been a long time since Kirknewton, Scotland, and the beer we drank on the
beach and the club. Had to get your address from the outfit in Texas.

Nick, whatever happened to Sgt Prater? If you know his whereabouts please
send me his address. How in the hell have you been doing?

Nick, I had a nervous breakdown. Plus in 74 my leg shattered in over a
hundred places. Things have really gone to hell for me. I'm working with
the vets benefits counseler, who is a ex 203. Speaking of 203's where the hell
is Frenchy? You know the little guy. What I'm going to say is no longer
classified, so don't get all shit shook. I've done checked it out.

Christ, you remember the position I worked at, in Sgt Praters section, don't
you? You remember about a month or 6 weeks before I left Scotland, when I picked
up a link mentioning the assassination of President Kennedy. How hard I tried
to get it sent out, and because of that fuckin Forney and Delaughter they wouldn't
send it to NSA. Since I have learned that the man's name, most mentioned was
number 4 in a certain branch of organized crime at the time. Was number 2 last
year. I will send you a form for proof of claim. This guy here \"the 203\" says
I should be getting a service connected disability for my nerves. The \"link was\"
Lisbon to Tangiers you remember. How I got my ass chewed for not dropping the
link. Have learned that this branch of crime often will put out a feeler of
forthcoming things. By sending it as a practice message.

Nick it really broke me up after Nov. 22, 63. Especially when I had it all
before hand. It was first like the 202's said, Ha. I was nuts when the Russians
first came out with the ITI & B's. Later proved them wrong didn't I. That was

Communications During March and April of 1962

TO: LAO

THRU: V

1. In response to Mr. Blakey's request of access to all communications
between Cobo Cleaners of Detroit, Michigan and Cuba in March and April
of 1962 the G offices were asked to examine all pertinent files to determine
whether or not copies of the requested communications existed. This
examination resulted in the following determinations:

a) In 1962 the only record copy storage media used by the G
offices were page print and microfilm.

b) Consistant with Agency regulations pertaining to records storage,
all materials, other than product, for 1962 were destroyed.

c) Therefore, no raw traffic data base exists which would include
private communications to or from Cuba for the period March/April of 1962.

2. Based on the foregoing, the information sought would exist, if at all,
at NSA only in the form of product based on the relevant communications. No
product files for the period involved exist within G Group.

1. Attached is our proposed response to the queries passed to us from
the House Assassinations Committee. The information requested was supposed
to be for the period 1959 - 31 December 1974. However, our first successful
interception of Cuban agent communications was on 17 April 1962. We
continued to intercept the communications through the end of the period,
but a communications change on 31 May 1964 rendered the messages unreadable.

2. The source products from which we extracted the attached informa-
tion were published in the Category III TRIG and DENT, US/UK EYES ONLY
series. We believe we have done sufficient sanitization so that, when the
association with NSA is removed, the text could be releasable as national

CUBAN AGENT ACTIVITY IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE 1959-31 DECEMBER 1974

Cuba used agents for intelligence and subversion in North, Central,
and South America; Africa; and Asia. Whenever possible, they operated
under diplomatic cover, getting instructions and communicating through
Cuban missions.

In the Western Hemisphere during the early sixties, diplomatic
cover became less available to the Cubans, and by spring of 1962,
Cuba had diplomatic relations with only one-third of the Latin American
countries. Cuba's interest in fomenting discord and promoting revolu-
tion obviously grew as she became more isolated officially from the
rest of the hemisphere, and the Cuban General Directorate of Intelli-
gence (DGI) inevitably increased its reliance on illegal/clandestine
agents. By the time of the Cuban \"missile crisis\" in October 1962,
Cuba was known to be in communication with agents in Florida, Puerto
Rico, Central America, and Ecuador, all areas in which diplomatic
cover was not available. The DGI expanded its clandestine contacts
as more Western Hemisphere countries severed diplomatic relations.
By the end of 1964, Cuba enjoyed formal relations in the hemisphere
with only Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, and the United Nations in New York.
The DGI maintained contact with its agents by all the routine under-
cover means (e.g., personal contact, prearranged signaling, secret
writing, hidden meanings in innocuous appearing mail and telegrams,
microdots, radio, and clandestine mail drops).

In 1962, the DGI was in direct or indirect contact with at least
35 covernames/covernumbers/pseudonyms believed to represent separate
agents; in 1963 this number grew to 49 and in 1964 the number was
back to 24. Agent locations for the period were New York, Miami,
Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia, La Paz, Guatemala, Mexico,
Chile, Ottawa, Lima and possibly the Dominican Republic.

During the period for which we have information (1962-1964),
Cuban agents were tasked with performing a wide range and variety of
tasks. With the exceptions of a task levied in 1962, possibly in
Ecuador, for the sabotage of any U.S. property and attacks and raids
on the U. S. Embassy, and a plan in Puerto Rico for the assassinations
of ANTONIO VECIANA, Puerto Rican spokesman for ALPHA 66, and
GERONIMO ESTEVEZ, a Cuban exile in Puerto Rico, all information on
DGI-associated activities fell into the categories of recruiting,
gathering information and reporting, spreading propaganda, and pure
logistics.

Agents in Miami, Costa Rica, and Guatemala were to establish and
maintain contacts with Cuban exiles and report on any counter-revolu-
tionary activities. The DGI directed that agents procure and send to
Cuba maps of their respective countries and guides to major cities.
All agents were furnished secure mail drop addresses in Havana and
intermediate cities outside of Cuba through which they could submit
reports, either in cable form or by secret writing using invisible

Doc ID: 68.791-09 Doc Ref ID. A 4269458 GIENSISTEMR

inks on innocent appearing letters.

A primary target for penetration was ALPHA 66, a Florida-based
exile organization reputed to have near-legendary powers and resources.
The Cuban government still claims U.S. government direction and funding
of the organization whose claimed activities included night raids
along the Cuban coast, infiltration of agents into Cuba, harassment
of the Cuban armed forces, and weapons drops to counter-revolutionary
groups on the island.

Agents in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico were to collect order-of-
battle information on U.S. forces, vessels and aircraft in Panama and
Puerto Rico, to establish activity norms and report any significant
deviations from the norm. Agent AMAPOLA in Miami was charged with
reporting on alert status of U.S. forces at Fort Bragg, Fort Benning
and Homestead Air Force Base. The field agents were to either
personally collect the information or cultivate and subvert individuals
who had access to it.

Where possible, agents attempted to work with or through Communist
parties in their countries. The Costa Rican Communist Party was used
by the Cuban agent there as an information collection organization, but
Agent BRUNO in La Paz encountered problems in dealing with the Bolivian
Communist Party. Agent PAMELA in Puerto Rico cultivated and encouraged
the activities of JUAN ANGEL SILEN ACEVEDO, Assistant Secretary General
of the Puerto Rican Independent Party.

ANY MATERIAL RELEVANT TO THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY OR
ANY INVESTIGATION INTO THE ASSASSINATION.

We have reviewed the Cuban materials previously compiled to
respond to SSCI and Church Committee hearings. The only information
regarding the KENNEDY assassination which surfaced might be termed
reactive; that is, it reflects some of the reactions of the Cuban
government to the assassination. Army and Navy elements in Eastern
Cuba were placed on alert status on 22 November, apparently in
reaction to news of the President's death. This action was probably
a reflection of the Cuban government's paranoia over a possible
military action against Cuba, possibly originating from the U. S.
Navy Base at Guantanamo. That the Cubans were sensitive to suggestions
that they might be implicated in the KENNEDY assassination is very
evident in the following 25 November press release from the Cuban
Foreign Ministry:

\"With relation to the information published today ((25 November))
in the newspaper EXCELSIOR in Mexico City, affirming that
LEE HARVEY OSWALD had requested a transit visa for travel to the
Soviet Union at the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September, the Cuban
Government requested information from the officials of our Consulate
in that city confirming that it is certain that Mr. LEE HARVEY OSWALD
requested the transit visa for travel to the Soviet Union on
27 September in the said consulate.

\"On being informed by the consular officials that their office
could not grant such a visa without the authorization of the Cuban
Ministry of Foreign Relations, which likewise would not grant it if
it was not previously authorized by the country of destination,
Mr. Oswald left the Consulate visibly disgusted.

\"The said visa was never granted.

\"This detail, in connection with the other circumstances that
surrounds the facts, confirm our suspicion that the assassination of
KENNEDY was a provocation against world peace, perfectly and thoroughly
planned by the most reactionary sectors of the United States.

\"It is evident that these sectors planned beforehand to involve
Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds.

\"The inconceivable and inexplicable impunity with which an
individual of known penal antecedents assassinated OSWALD, the
principal accused of the assassination of President KENNEDY, in
the presence of the police themselves and in the basement of a
prison, demonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable manner that
the powerful reactionary political forces within the United States
are making use of all their resources and influences in order to
conceal those who master-minded KENNEDY's assassination, and the
true motives for it.

Doc ID: 6879109 Doc Ref ID 4269458) SENSITIVE

\"World public opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds.
It is absurd that the political authorities and the prosecuting
attorney of Dallas have declared that the case is closed when hardly
48 hours have passed since a deed of so great a result as the
assassination of the President of the United States.\"

TOP SECRET

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY
OF DEFENSE (INTELLIGENCE)

SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee Queries to NSA Concerning
the Warren Commission

Reference your letter dated 14 January 1976 transmitting
a request from Mr. Alton Quanbeck of the Senate Select
Committee Staff. The following information is provided in
response to Mr. Quanbeck's letter, keyed by paragraph to
his letter (inclosed see underlined portions). Most of
the information was made available to the SSC Staff, Mr.
Jim Johnson, during an interview with Dr. Louis Tordella
on 20 January 1976.

Para. 1. NSA requested permission to retain
photocopies of those reports on which we had worked merely
as record copies of our efforts on behalf of the Commission.
It was felt that if a question should arise at that time
concerning what analytic efforts had been involved and the
number of manhours expended, a record copy would prove useful.
No operational use was made of these documents except to
hold them on file for a period of time which cannot now be
determined. To the best of our present knowledge, the photo-
copies have now been destroyed. Absolutely no results
relevant to the assassination were obtained through NSA'S
analytic look at the exhibits. The Commission, in the person
of Mr. Allan Dulles, had asked Dr. Tordella, informally, to
review the exhibits for any secret writing or codes which
might have been contained in the documents. Dr. Tordella,
after causing a careful review of the documents by NSA crypt-
analysts, reported verbally to Mr. Dulles and other Commission
members that nothing whatsoever had been achieved by the
analytic effort. No written reply was submitted.

Para. 2. NSA is uncertain as to what is precisely
meant by these comments, but we assume that the comments on
names refer to our biographic files which are maintained on
foreign personalities of potential intelligence significance.
As the Committee knows, these biographic files are maintained
(now at CIA incidentally) as analytic support. It is also
possible that the Commission was referring to the fact that
names are frequently seen in traffic collected for foreign
intelligence purposes and therefore NSA might have access
to foreign names not otherwise available to the Intelligence
Community.

Para. 3. It may well be that CIA did obtain such
transmissions and pass them to NSA for analysis, but no one
presently working that analytic area recalls such a request.
Discussions with Dr. Tordella also failed to shed any light
on this subject. There are no files or records which we have
been able to locate from that time frame which would sub-
stantiate such a claim. In fact, the only file the responsible
analytic group has been able to locate concerning a request
from the Warren Commission deals with a file compiled from
open sources citing major dates in the last months of Oswald's
life. Presumably the date file was to be compared with NSA
product on/about the key dates in the hope that something
could be deduced. The file does not contain any \"hits.\"
The analysts who performed this effort have since retired.

Para. 4. The informal request from Mr. Dulles is
the known total extent of NSA's role in assisting in the
investigation. The file discussed in Paragraph 3 is the only
file thus far recovered. There is no information which can
now be identified which was developed from Cuban or Soviet.
transmissions relating to the assassination.

Para. 5. We have no information on this subject
at all. However, pursuant to the subject raised during the
Tordella interview, we have searched our files manually,
and as Mr. Lowman agreed during the Tordella interview, we
have recovered three product reports (Inclosures 2 through
4) which show that Cuban military forces did go on alert
immediately after the assassination. There is no SIGINT
evidence, however, that the Cuban forces were alerted prior
to the assassination, thereby suggesting that they had prior
knowledge of the event.

Mr. Thomas K. Latimer
Special Assistant to the Secretary
U. S. Department of Defense
Washington, D. C. 20301

Dear Tom:

In connection with the Select Committee's investigation of
the assassination of President Kennedy, we earlier received
answers to certain questions put to NSA. Since then we have
examined other material pertaining to NSA's contribution to
the Warren Commission's investigation and we desire further in-
formation from NSA.

By way of background for this request, we note the Warren
Commission provided NSA various documents and asked NSA to re-
view them for any cryptological significance. NSA found no
cryptological significance and its report of this fact was pub-
lished by the Commission.

1. By letter of July 10, 1964, (a copy of which is attached)
Mr. Rankin provided General Blake a copy of certain documents
requested by Dr. Tordella for NSA's files. Since NSA's analysis
of the documents was apparently completed at the time of Rankin's
letter we wish to know why NSA wanted to keep these documents
for its file. Further, we wish to know what use, if any, was
made of these documents and what results relevant to the assassina-
tion were obtained from such use.

2. In a Commission staff internal memorandum, discussing the
documents provided NSA, it is reported that NSA is \"primarily
interested in names,\" and NSA claims it has \"information on names
which the CIA does not have.\" Assuming these statements are ac-
curate, we wish to know what significance such names would have

to NSA and what information on names NSA had that CIA did not.
If names had significance, what names did NSA use in its analysis?

3. We are informed that CIA obtained transmissions from the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City for November or December 1963 and
that it may have passed these to NSA for analysis. Did NSA re-
ceive these transmissions or any transmissions relevant to the
assassination inquiry? Did it analyze them? What were the re-
sults of its analysis?

4. We are interested in learning the extent of NSA's role in
assisting in the investigation of the assassination. In that
connection, please inform the Committee the extent of NSA files
relating to the assassination. Please provide the staff of the
Committee access to those files. Please provide the staff with
a summary of all information NSA developed from Cuban or Soviet
transmissions relating to the assassination.

5. We have been informed that after the assassination the
Cuban government instructed its embassies and consulates to re-
turn all files on Oswald to Cuba. What information does NSA
have on whether such instructions were issued?

6. In connection with the answers to questions 4 and 5, please
indicate whether such material was provided the Warren Commission
and provide copies of all documents evidencing that fact.

We would appreciate receiving a response to these questions
as soon as possible and to expedite this inquiry we are sending
a copy of this letter to Mr. Foster of NSA.

STATUS OF CUBAN/SOVIET CORENICATIONE AS OF 29 NOVEMBER 1963

PART I A: SOVIET MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN MOSCOW AND HAVANA

The Soviet Ministry of Defense-subordinated link \"B\" between
Moscow and Havana continues to be active in both Morse and radio-
printer scrambler as late as 28 November 1963. Operator chatter
sent in reverse order again was noted on 20 November. The last
tive this chatter was observed we on 15 October.

PART I B: SOVIET COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN CUBA

Since 12 November 1963 three koown attempts to break in on
Soviet/Cuban commandations activities have been noted. The first
attempt was made on the Air Defense link between Limonar and a
terminal suspected of being in the San Julian area. On that
occasion, an activity utilising the callsign NOC contacted one of
the Soviet operators and queried him as to his location and
whether there was any traffic for him. A cowersation of approxi-
macely 10 minutes ensued, containing repeated queries as to the
location of the Soviet station, before the Soviet operator terminated
the schedule.

Later the same day a possible second attempt of the same type
was ande. This time, the link interrupted was the Air Defense link
between Linegar and Sagus le Grande, and the unidentified activity
used the callsign NSS. Again the Soviet terminated the conver
sation without divulging any information as to his whereabouts,

On 15 November, an attempt was made by an unidentified activity
to portray itself as net control of the Soviet Naval network in
Cuba. At 21022 the station made a collective call utilising the
correct signals for the day. However, the accept was abettive as
a result of the rather poor simulacion of Soviet procedure,
Minutes after the attempt the control of the Soviet neval net sent
a warning to the other startonst \"some other station is working
with our celisigns,\"

Sowar of the death of President RED was noted on the Naval
net on 23 November, Operator chatter messages were noted which
asked for details of the assassination. The only details men-
tioned were chat \"Yesterday in Dallas he was shot by a sniper
with a large calibre (rifle) Mortally wounded JON KENNEDY,
Be died,\"

During the past werk nine Soviet Forses Cuba HP Links used
scrambler. They were as follows: the two subordinated links
with both terminals in the Ravane area, rise unsubordinated link

between the Havana and Holguin areas, the new Air Defense-associated
link between the Havana and Camaguey areas, the Limonar-Pinar del
Rio and Sagua la Grande links of the Western Sector Weapons Control
Group and the Camaguey Victoria de las Tunas and Santiago de Cuba/
areas of the Kastera Sector Weapons Contral Group, and a new
Limonar-controlled Air Defense-associated link on which scrambler
as first heard 21 and 22/23 November. The outstation terminal of
this new link is unlocated, Soviet scrambler activity was noted
as late as 23 Novesber on Cubau microwave facilities and
27 November on Soviet multichannel/VHF (R-401) facilities.

PART I CE SOVIET AIR AND ALS TREINSS COMMUNICATIONS

The subscriber to the Soviet Forces Cuba (SFC) Western Sector
Weapons Control group located at San Antonio de los Banos continues
to be inactive in HF Horse comunications as of 27 November. The
station was last noted active on 15 October 1963. It is possible
that the air defense-associated link between Limonar and an unlo
cated station is now serving the lespean control group function.
Scrambler communications were noted on the link on 21 November, for
the first time, and agala on 22/23 November.

All three of the subscribers to the Eastern Sector Weapons
Control Group reappeared in BF More cornunications on 21 November
1963. The stations at Santiago de Cuba, Victoria de les Tunas, and
an unrecovered location had not been heard in HP Horse communica-
tions since 23 October, 02 November, and 06 November, respectively.
No explanation can be offered at this time for thesa periods of
Morse inactivity.

The Soviet Forces Cuba radas reporting groups continue to
use the Cuban low level edhe system (see 2/O/CURUK/R203-63) as
of 27 November 1963. As the past, both radar operational and
Spanish Imnguage generypted in the system.

Conversations on Sov. VHF multicharmel (2-401) radio relay
Facilities on 11 November 1963 between SAM reginental head-
quarters at Victoria de las Tunas and a subordinate SAM site at
Los Angeles revealed that some Soviet SAM personnel would arrive
In Cuba about 20 Noveuber alward a vestel which departed Lenfhgrad
on 05 Novesbar. There was no reference to the total number of
personnel arriving; however, the speaker at the regiment Indicated
that he knew two of the individuals win vare arriving. The names
of the individuals have not been previously observed in Soviet SAM
communications in Cuba.

A conversacice do 08 October 1963 batasan probable Sall regi
mental headquarters santiago las veges and a subordinate SAM
site at Siguenea Airfield contain a reformace to Mexico. The
speaker at the regiment stated \"TURKA (further unidentified)
is arriving in a few days, ich? A. You know, YUKBA? Well
they are (IG) together with his son, hash? They
have an endless plan, do you understand? Just to go...yes...
of course.\"

2/0/CURUJ/R66-63
Also discussed was the arrival of aircraft from the Soviet
Union and the question of nail being aboard the flight which
arrived at Havana on 08 October. A TU-114 did arrive in Cuba on
08 October and two 10-114 aircraft arrived Cuba on 11 October.
In addition to the country of Mexico, there are three places in
Cuba that bear that name; they are ac 21-18 77-16W, 21-46N
77-48M, and 21-18N 77-33N. There are no Soviet SAM installations
near any of these locations.

Radio operators on SFC sir defense comunications continue
to make reference to inexperienced operators. Ic is possibly sig-
nificant that experienced operators are manning the sets during the
times of the GOLDEN TREE missions. Radio operators have also dis-
cussed the departure of the Soviet vessel KALININ.

Five intercepts of missile/target tracking S-band FAN SONG
(BF 29) radars have been reported by ELINT sources during the
past week. A brief intercept at 13342 on 23 November tends to con-
fira operation of the band version of FAN SONG radar at the Punta
Brava site (23-01 82-31M). Other S-band FAN SONG sites noted
active were Mariel, Managua, Havana East and Matanzas.

ELINT information indicates S-band FAN SONG radars in opera-
tion at fourteen of the twenty-four SAM sites in Cuba, including
two emitters located at San Julian

S-band FAR SONG interceta have occurred daily since
11 November 1963, except fonday, 24 Fovember. The duration
of the target tracking sigmis recorded thus fer in November has
averaged less than four minutes, with approximately fifty percent
of the recent intercepts not exceeding one minute in duration.
The longest recent intercept occurred on 15 November for a
period of approximately 19 minutes. The majority of intercepts
during the current monch have occurred during morning hours;
however, intercepts after 1700% were reported on 14, 20 and
23 November.

PART II: CUBAN COMMUNICATIONS

Cuban microwave facilities revealed a new communications
link serving the Anti-Air Defense/Revolutionary Air Force (DAA/
FAR) Headquarters and a date CRAF facility at Varadera
on 14 November 1963. The cominal ac Varadero has subsequently
been active on 19 November 1963 and was referred to in a conver
sation between the Anti-Air Defense/Revolutionary Air Force (DAA/
FAR) Headquarters and an unknown terminal on 22 November 1963.
Activity has consisted of sommations chatter with only one
message, requesting oxygen taks and oil, having been noced on
14 November. This link any presage an increase of ivity at
Varadero.

in the Escambray Motain area has been observed in COMINT during
this reporting period. In addition to the ICB forces reported to
be participating in chis operation, the deployment of Western Army
troops to the area indicates an increased operational effort(
(2/0/CU3/R55-63 and 2/YT/C/R113-63).

Several references to a combing operation utilizing the com
bined efforts of the Department of State Security (DSE), Depart-
ment of Public Order (DOP), and the coastal vigilance observation
post force ware geflented in messages from Central Army HQ, Santa
Clara, to MORTAR, Revana, on 23 November. This operation was
affected at Cayo Aliqui (22-22M 79-11W), Municipality of Yaguajay,
In order to apprehend persons attempting to flee the country
(2/SL/CUM/R293-63).

There were also several messages about an operation in the
Sagua La Grande area of Las Villas Province. An insurgent band
consisting of three individuals was captured at San Pedro Farm,
in the Municipality of Corvalillo (22-59M 80-36%), on 21 November.
Members of LCB Military Unit Number 3009 (San Vicente, 22-55N
80-296) were apparently utilized for this operation
(2/SL/CUM/R286-63, 2/13/M/R292-63).

Reference to a new organisation\" was observed in a message
intercepted on Anti-surgent Forces communications at 21262 on
26 November. The Chief of Personnel, ICB Division, Trinidad,
ordered the Chiefs of Personnel of his subordinate battalions to
report to his headquarters to try to resolve the new organization.
Sinco mention was made of a new organization and not \"reorganiza-
tion,\" the possibility exists that this is in reference to tha
Cuben Government's Anti-Raider Forces (LCP). Prior references to
LCP have not been observed in this particular area, substantiating
the possibility of the LCP organisation in southern Las Villas
Province (2/13/COM/8301-63).

The bilateral field minivers conducted by elements of the
Central Army during the period 25 to 30 November ware apparently
witnessed by officials representing Ground Forces elements through-
out Caba. Invitations to observe these maneuvers were extended to
officials or delegations of Western Army Headquarters and First
Army Headquarters, Anti-Air Defensa/FAR, and Haval Headquarters,
Havana, Representatives from MINFAR were also invited, and all
observers were to be at Cienfuegos by 21002 on 24 November, indi-
eating that the rovers (or at least some phase of these
mapeuvers) were to be held in the Cienfuegos area (2/SL/CUJ/R20-63)

An interest of the Cuban Military intelligence in the U.S.-
Latin American military exercise ('Cabeza de Playa America\"), to
be held next week in Colombia, was evidenced by the intercept of
a uszsége in welch the Cid of of Intelligence at First Army Readi
quarters reported the exercise to hte counterpart in Guantanans
on 21 November 1963 (2/LK/син/1185-63).

All subordinates of the First Army Headquarters in both
Bastern and Southwestern Oriente sere placed in an alert statu
at 23202 on 22 November 1963 (2/LRL/CUM/187-63).

The urg: ot need of food at the Pilon (probably 19-56N
77-198) Coastal Battalion was revealed in a message from the
Chief, South Sector, Sierra Meestica Headquarters, Pilon, to Chief
of Services, First Army Headquarters, on 25 November 1963
(2/LR1/COM/T663-63).

PART IT BE CUBAL SEX CONJUGATIONSS

One of the LP's, the IC-250, has suffered one
of the first sccidents involving a ROMAR vessel in Cuba. At
approximately 08302 on 26 Noveber the LC-250 ran aground while
ente ing the port of Mariel, sustaining uncontrollable leaks.
Salvage vestele saut to the scene Included the GC-59, 80-11,
and LV-28; they were estimated to have worked until 2215z, when
it was reported selvage operations were couplate (2/QS/CUN/R679-63
and 2/3L/001/135-63). The 10-250 is now in drydock, presumably
at Hariel (2/QS/CUN/R585-63).

A Geben motorship named the INDALSCIO was forced by passengers
to put into the Conceivenolie on 26 November. For persona
aboard the vessel were reported to have taken asylum at the base but
a reliable collateral source states that 15 parsons remained at the
base and four others returned with the INDALICIO. The vessel was
escorted by a destroyer to the canal leading to Calmanera
(19-596-75-07 from the Nevalanse (2/LL/CUM/8190, 186-63 and
2/Qs/ct/8681-63), Alster raport disclosed that 12 passengers and
5 craneo, including the ship's captain, remained at the Guantanamo
Naval Base (27.81/CM/3191-63)28

An alert which begin on 22 Bovenbur in Ortente Province was
apparently propted by the death of President KENNEDY. While no
orders or ditentives have been noted canceling the alert, there
were Andiuntions that is probably me to terminate on 25 November.
On 23 Rovember instructione vere passed from Banes to a subordi-
nate unit that leaven coil te granted to 25 percent of its
personnel (2/0/003/936-63
270/CUN/R196-63).

The USNS JOSEPH E. HUILER, TAC-171, has been the subject
of recurring Cuban rojores concerning its position. These re-
porto bave been noted being passed from Ravana to Cabanas, the
KOMAR-class 2CHO Headquarters. The raports were firet noted in
September and have continued until November (2/0/C:/K195-63).

The Cabanas Naval Baan was inforsed on 23 November hy Naval
Readquarters in Havn that there would he exercises scheduled
from 23 to 30 November in the tey trest sees by U.S. aircraft. The
exercices would leclude pyrotechnical and lateral firing, air to
ground Elring and illumination practices. The inforation was
reported to have been obtained by our sources.\" These sources
were not identified (2/SL/CUM/830-63).

2/0/CURUJ/R66-63
The coast guard vessel GC-79 was ordered on 22 November to
patrol an area from 22-49M 83-47W to 22-50N 63-39w to intercept
some pirate vessels. Later the vessel was directed to patrol from
22-43084-028 to a point 20 miles north of Bahia Honda and then
to go to Havana upon completion of the assignment. Apparently,
chis mission was carried out without success since there have been
no further reflections of the pirate vessels (2/0/CUN/R198-63 and
2/QS/CUN/R554-63).

The location of the Anti-Pirate Organization (ICP, LUCHA CONTRA
PIRATAS) Mus revealed as in the Bestern as well as in the Central and
probably Eastern portions of Cuba shen a Captain (PNU) PANTOJA, iden-
tified as the Chief of the ICP, cuthorized the installation of some
unidentified equipment at in observation post in the western Naval
District. A Major PEDRO LUIS RODRIGUEZ has been noted as ICP Com-
mander; it is believed that Capt PANTOJA Is Commander of the
Western LCP forces or possibly a local LCP commander in the
Wescurn Naval District, the LCP is probably subordinate to the
Anti-Insurgent Forces (2/0/CIJ/R56-63).

There has been only one incer-area movement noted in the period
covered by this report. On 27 Movember intercept disclosed that the
frigate P-543, which has been operating out of Cienfuegos since
28 August 1963, was to return to Havana. On 29 November the 7543 re-
ported it had entered Western Naval District jurisdictional waters.
The time of departure Eton Cienfuegos was not observed
(2/qs/CL/8680-63).

A possible antistroreft Heing practice was held, probably in
the Cabanas area, on 26 November from 1500z to 18002. The firing
consisted of 37-marciiley planes. It was reported that an area
higher than 5,000 meters or further than 300 meters from the coast
would be considered safe (2/81/cw/R32-63). 0

The KOMAR-cinas POND's (LC) were active in various practices
during the work. Two LC's were involved in K-2 technique training
from 2423592 to 2503002. On 28 November, four LC's participated
in an undet andre type of practice in the Cabanas/Mariel area
from 10002 το 1700 (2/70/1670-63, 1672-63, 8682-63).

In the Eastern Restrict the 00-55 was engaged in night
exorcises of a three-fold natures there was training of officers
in night navigation, familiarization of local comunications pro-
cedures, and a radar sxencian (probably a radar calibration test
for Punta de Halas) (see 2/0/CUM/8192-63).

MEMORANDUM FOR THE HONORABLE DEANNE SIEMER, GENERAL COUNSEL,
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

SUBJECT: Pending Congressional Requests

REFERENCES: (a) 15 December 1977 letter from Senator George
McGovern to Secretary of Defense

(b) Undated letter received on 20 December 1977
from Congressman Louis Stokes to Director, NSA

(c) 16 December 1977 letter from Mr. Ira Nordlicht
to the Honorable Deanne Siemer

1. Referenced letters iterating requests for information
from the National Security Agency present two common issues:
namely, whether signals intelligence information is to be pro-
vided to Congressional Committees which exercise no traditional
oversight over intelligence matters; and, if it is to be provided,
how it is to be done. NSA Charter legislation, now in draft form,
would obligate the Director to keep the Committees of the Congress,
having jurisdiction over the Agency, fully and currently informed
of the Agency's activities. Provision of information to other
committees would be responsive to policy developed within the
community.

2. We anticipate that requests for information, as illus-
trated by the three referenced letters, will continue to increase
and can present difficulties in maintaining good relations with
the Congress. While this Agency has been fully responsive to
the needs of the Intelligence, Armed Services, and Appropriations
Committees, we have treated requests for information by other
committees on a purely case-by-case basis. Several times during
the past two years, Committees of the Congress which do not have
jurisdiction for intelligence oversight have approached NSA
directly for foreign signals intelligence information. In each
case it has been our understanding that the SIGINT information
NSA has provided to the requesting committee is being used as
background information in assisting that committee in formulating
U.S. policy matters. On these infrequent occasions, NSA has
responded directly to the requesting committee providing either
access to SIGINT product or briefings, as required.

3. Regarding these three specific requests, inclosed for
your information is a summary of NSA's contacts with Senator
McGovern's Subcommittee on International Operations. As indi-
cated in the summary and as discussed previously with Mr. Andrews
of your staff, we have not shown nor discussed any material with
Senator McGovern's staff representative pending the drafting of
an approved memorandum of understanding by your office and the
execution of such an MOU between the Executive Branch and the
Senator.

4. In his letter received by NSA on 20 December, Representa-
tive Louis Stokes, Chairman of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations, requested certain information from NSA relating
to the Cuban intelligence network during the period 1959 1964.
Chairman Stokes also certified that access to any NSA material
would be restricted to those staff members with a TOP SECRET
security clearance; access to NSA material, of course, requires
indoctrination for SI as well. No response has been made to
Chairman Stokes' correspondence pending resolution of how NSA
should deal with non-oversight committees. Once that decision
is made, we recommend that any SIGINT information selected for
the Select Committee on Assassinations be provided only by the
DOD or DCI as part of a larger submission of data and that the
SIGINT be properly sanitized.

5. Mr. Ira Nordlicht's 16 December letter to you requested
information from NSA on the flow of oil to South Africa and
Rhodesia. At the time of his initial telephone call, Mr. Nordlicht
had a TOP SECRET clearance. It is our understanding that he has
since been indoctrinated for SI/TK by DIA. While any SIGINT
pertinent to Mr. Nordlicht's request may contain unique informa-
tion, it must be emphasized that SIGINT alone may be incomplete
or misleading unless it is examined in the context of all-source
intelligence information. In this instance, after the execution
of a suitable MOU, we recommend the requested information be
furnished by the DCI combining the SIGINT with other materials
available to him. You may recall that earlier this year the
Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy requested and was
provided information on Arab foreign investments and the lifting
and sale of Saudi and Iranian oil. This is the information which
was provided specifically to Mr. Jerome Levinson, then counsel
of the Subcommittee, and which subsequently formed the basis for
a 20 June 1977 letter from Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the
Subcommittee, to the secretary of State citing \"...a substantial
discrepancy between CIA and NSA estimates of Saudi crude oil
exports in the first quarter of 1977.\" This charge was repeated

by Mr. Levinson in an article by Seymour M. Hersh appearing
in the New York Times of December 25, 1977. Mr. Nordlicht
stated his present request is not related to the previous
inquiry.
:
6. The lack of an MOU or other agreed procedure for dealing
with requests for SIGINT from other than the three traditional
oversight committees mentioned above has severely hampered NSA'S
ability to be responsive to the Congress. We urgently recommend
that an agreed procedure be developed between the Executive and
Legislative Branches which would set forth the terms and condi-
tions on which sensitive cryptologic or other intelligence
information would be provided to the non-oversight committees.
In the absence of such an agreement with both the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and the House Select Committee on Assassina-
tions, we cannot respond to these queries. We also recommend
that your office so advise Congressman Stokes and Mr. Noralicht
and also determine a proper response to Senator McGovern
consistent with the President's instructions.

SUMMARY OF SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
OF SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE
DISCUSSIONS WITH NSA
MAY NOV 1977

On 6 May 1977, Senator George McGovern, Chairman of the Sub-
committee on International Operations, Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, sent a letter to NSA informing the Agency of the Sub-
committee's pending investigation into matters relating to (1)
the activities of intelligence agencies of foreign nations in
the U.S. and foreign-sponsored surveillance, harassment or intimi-
dation of private persons, and (2) efforts by/foreign interests to
influence official U.S. Government policy. We understand that a
similar letter was sent to the Secretary on/15 June.

Since that time, Mr. Michael Glennon, Legal Counsel for the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, visited NSA on 15 June to
explain in more detail the scope of the Committee's investigation
of item (1) above: (a) whether intelligence agencies of foreign
nations are engaging in harassment, intimidation and surveillance
of foreign nationals here in the U.S.; (b) against whom these
activities are directed; (c) who is performing these activities
on behalf of the intelligence agencies; (d) how often it occurs
and what form it takes; (e) where these activities are conducted;
and (f) to what extent U.S. intelligence and law enforcement
agencies may be \"cooperating\" with or \"acquiesing\" in this activity.
This information will, according to Mr. Glennon, help the Committee
evaluate the extent to which intelligence agencies of foreign
nations can conclude that their activities are condoned. He
stated that it was his intention to talk also with the FBI, DIA,
and CIA, and we understand he has done so.

NSA made no substantive contribution during this visit since
Mr. Glennon did not hold an SI clearance.

On 14 September 1977, Mr. Glennon requested by secure tele-
phone that NSA brief him on information NSA may have about the
harassment, intimidation and surveillance of foreign nationals
in the U.S. by organizations such as SAVAK (Iran), DINA (Chile)
and comparable organizations of the Soviet Union and the Philip-
pines. In response we searched our product records for the
period 10 Nov 76-1 Nov 77 to determine whether NSA had any
information pertaining to, this request. We found several reports
dealing directly with foreign operations in the U.S. (i.e., SAVAK
arranging for the search of a house in Houston, Texas, and SAVAK
reports on demonstrations planned during the Shah's visit to the
U.S.), and two Chilean (DINA) items relating to the assassination

in Washington of a former Chilean ambassador. There were no
reflections of such activities by the Soviet Union or the
Philippines.

Mr. Glennon did not ask for information on efforts by foreign
interests to influence U.S. Government policy at this time and
no search was made for SIGINT on this aspect of the Subcommittee's
investigation.
:
The Director, NSA, reviewed these reports on 17 November
and said they were not to be shown to or discussed with Mr. Glennon
until the memorandum of understanding between the Executive branch
and Senator McGovern on behalf of the Subcommittee on International
Operations is executed. Mr. Glennon was so advised in late
November and again in early December.

Although the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has been
conducting a similar investigation since January 1977, they have
focused primarily on KCIA activities. None of the product records
pertaining to Mr. Glennon's request have been provided the SSCI.

M/R: a. On 17 May 1977, the Director proposed in a memorandum
to the DCI that the DCI assume responsibility for acting as the
focal point for requests for intelligence information from any
Committee of the Congress which does not have direct oversight
responsibilities. This proposal included the recommendation
that the channel of communications for such requests should
be through a designated individual on the IC Staff and that
responses to the Congress should flow back through the same
person, providing the DCI, on behalf of the President, the oppor-
tunity to review what intelligence information is made available
to the Congress. The DCI has never responded to this memorandum.

b. Instant memo recommends that an agreed procedure be
developed between the Executive and Legislative Branches which
would set forth the terms and conditions on which sensitive
cryptologic or other intelligence information would be provided
to the non-oversight committees. It also recommends OSD GC
assume action on R/S 5507 and provides background information
on two Congressional requests (references a and c) for SIGINT
information now pending in OSD.

Director
National Security Agency
Fort George G. Meade, Maryland 20755

Dear Mr. Director:

The Select Committee on Assassinations was
established by the House of Representatives pursuant
to House Resolutions 222 and 433 to investigate the
assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. In conjunction with our
investigation into the assassination of President
Kennedy, it has come to the Committee's attention that
the National Security Agency has information which
will be of substantial assistance to the Committee's
inquiry.

The information to which the Committee staff
needs access and which is held by the National Security
Agency is all outlines and summaries and biographical
data relating to the Cuban Intelligence network of
Premier Castro covering the period from 1959 - December 31,
1964 with emphasis on operations by Cuban Intelligence
operatives in the United States and other Latin American
countries, and any analyses of the direction and evaluation
of specific assassination operations.

In addition, the Committee requests that it be
provided access to any other materials you have relevant
to the assassination of President Kennedy or any
investigation into the assassination. Access to all
materials we will receive from the National Security
Agency will be restricted to staff members with a TOP
SECRET security clearance.

The Committee requests that it be provided with
these materials as soon as possible, and would very much
appreciate it if we could receive such access prior to
the end of December. Should you have any questions con-
cerning this request, please address them to myself or
our Chief Counsel, G. Robert Blakey.

Attached is a request from the SSCI.
I have talked to Fred Cassedy at the FBI
and he says that the Committee is looking
into the Kennedy assassination and that
the SSC provided Veciana's name.

I intend to contact Howard Liebengood
next week and will probably arrange for
the SSCI to review the document out here

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 4 January 1977
SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) Inquiry
into the Assassinations of Kennedy and King

1. On 30 December, the undersigned met with Howard
Liebengood, Deputy Staff Director of the SSCI staff and Tom
Moore, staff member. The meeting was to permit the Committee
to read an NSA end-product report on Cuba in response to the
Committee's letter %235900 dated 20 December 1976. The Committee
staff members exhibited keen interest in the product and the
two Cuban national names contained therein. The Committee
staff also indicated that they intended to broaden the scope
of their inquiry and would forward to NSA another letter
(which has been received and is inclosed) requesting access
to all Cuban reports stored in the repository for the period
1961-1965.

2. After the meeting, the undersigned contacted LTC Don
Bennett of Mr. Latimer's office to inform him of the first
letter since it had been sent directly to NSA. LTC Bennett
indicated that another DoD component had been asked for similar
information. As a result, LTC Bennett stated Mr. Latimer was
revising his earlier containing policy on providing to the
SSCI information on the assassinations and now had decided on
a policy of full cooperation. At Mr. Latimer's direction,
LTC Bennett will draft a letter to Staff Director Bill Miller
suggesting a meeting between the SSCI staff and Mr. Latimer's
staff; the meeting will focus on projected DoD responses to
the Committee's inquiry. NSA will be invited to attend these
meetings.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY
OF DEFENSE (INTELLIGENCE)

SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee Queries to NSA Concerning
the Warren Commission

Reference your letter dated 14 January 1976 transmitting
a request from Mr. Alton Quanbeck of the Senate Select
Committee Staff. The following information is provided in
response to Mr. Quanbeck's letter, keyed by paragraph to
his letter (inclosed see underlined portions). Most of
the information was made available to the SSC Staff, Mr.
Jim Johnson, during an interview with Dr. Louis Tordella
on 20 January 1976.

Para. 1. NSA requested permission to retain
photocopies of those reports on which we had worked merely
as record copies of our efforts on behalf of the Commission.
It was felt that if a question should arise at that time
concerning what analytic efforts had been involved and the
number of manhours expended, a record copy would prove useful.
No operational use was made of these documents except to
hold them on file for a period of time which cannot now be
determined. To the best of our present knowledge, the photo-
copies have now been destroyed. Absolutely no results
relevant to the assassination were obtained through NSA's
analytic look at the exhibits. The Commission, in the person
of Mr. Allan Dulles, had asked Dr. Tordella, informally, to
review the exhibits for any secret writing or codes which
might have been contained in the documents. Dr. Tordella,
after causing a careful review of the documents by NSA crypt-
analysts, reported verbally to Mr. Dulles and other Commission
members that nothing whatsoever had been achieved by the
analytic effort. No written reply was submitted.

Serial: N0078

Para. 2. NSA is uncertain as to what is precisely
meant by these comments, but we assume that the comments on
names refer to our biographic files which are maintained on
foreign personalities of potential intelligence significance.
As the Committee knows, these biographic files are maintained
(now at CIA incidentally) as analytic support. It is also
possible that the Commission was referring to the fact that
names are frequently seen in traffic collected for foreign
intelligence purposes and therefore NSA might have access
to foreign names not otherwise available to the Intelligence
Community.

Para. 3. It may well be that CIA did obtain such
transmissions and pass them to NSA for analysis, but no one
presently working that analytic area recalls such a request.
Discussions with Dr. Tordella also failed to shed any light
on this subject. There are no files or records which we have
been able to locate from that time frame which would sub-
stantiate such a claim. In fact, the only file the responsible ..
analytic group has been able to locate concerning a request
from the Warren Commission deals with a file compiled from
open sources citing major dates in the last months of Oswald's
life. Presumably the date file was to be compared with NSA
product on/about the key dates in the hope that something
could be deduced. The file does not contain any \"hits.\"
The analysts who performed this effort have since retired.

Para. 4. The informal request from Mr. Dulles is
the known total extent of NSA's role in assisting in the
investigation. The file discussed in Paragraph 3 is the only
file thus far recovered. There is no information which can
now be identified which was developed from Cuban or Soviet
transmissions relating to the assassination.

Para. 5. We have no information on this subject
at all. However, pursuant to the subject raised during the
Tordella interview, we have searched our files manually,
and as Mr. Lowman agreed during the Tordella interview, we
have recovered three product reports (Inclosures 2 through
4) which show that Cuban military forces did go on alert
immediately after the assassination. There is no SIGINT
evidence, however, that the Cuban forces were alerted prior
to the assassination, thereby suggesting that they had prior
knowledge of the event.

Mr. Hark Allen
F. 0. Box 9032
Washington, DC 20003

Dear Mr. Allen:

This responds to your letter of 12 January 1901 in which you request all
correspondence or records of any communication between this Agency and the
U. S. House Select Committee on Assassinations concerning the Committee's
investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Your request has been processed under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552,
the Freedom of Information Act. Information which is releasable is enclosed.

National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) functions,
activities, and internal organizational designators, as well as titles and
names of NSA/CSS employees, have been deleted from the enclosures. These
deletions have been made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), in conjunction with
50 U.S.C. 402 note (Public Law 86-36). Section 6 of Public Law 86-36 provides
that no law shall be construed to require the disclosure of the organization.
or any function of the NSA, of any information with respect to the activities
thereof, or of the names, titles, salaries, or number of persons employed by
the Agency.

Other items have been deleted from the enclosures pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552(b)(6), as their disclosure would cause an unwarranted invasion of the
personal privacy of the individuas concerned.

The remaining items have been deleted because they are classified and
therefore exempt from access or release pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1), which
provides that the Freedom of Information Act does not apply to matters that
are specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order
to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and
are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order. The infor-
mation is currently and properly classified in accordance with the criteria
for classification in Section 1-3 of Executive Order 12065, and paragraph
2-202 of Department of Defense Regulation 5200.1-R. The information has been
reviewed for possible declassification or downgrading according to the provisions
of Sections 3-3, 3-4, and 3-6 of Executive Order 12065 and Chapter III of
DoD Regulation 5200.1-R and found to be properly excluded from declassification
or downgrading.

NW 78334 Docld:34630151 Page 2

Serial: N9022

In addition, this Agency is authorized by law to protect certain
information concerning its activities. Title 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), exempts
matters that are specifically exempted from disclosure by statute. The
applicable statutes in this case are 18 U.S.C. 798, 50 U.S.C. 402 note
(Public Law 86-36), and 50 U.S.C. 403(d) (3). DoD Directive 5400.7, Sections
III and VI.C.3, specifically recognizes this exemption.

As the deleted items constitute a partial denial of your request, you
are hereby advised of this Agency's appeal procedures.

Any person denied access to records, or parts thereof, may, within 30
days after notification of the denial, file an appeal to the NSA/CSS Freedom
of Information Act Appeal Authority. The appeal shall be in writing addressed
to the NSA/CSS FOLA Appeal Authority, National Security Agency, Fort George
G. Meade, MD 20755. The appeal shall reference the initial denial of access
and shall contain, in sufficient detail and particularity, the grounds upon
which the requester believes release of the information is required. The
NSA/CSS Appeal Authority shall respond to the appeal within 20 working days
after receipt.

Please be advised that records originated by the Congress of the United
States are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 28 November 1978

SUBJECT: Visit to House Select Committee on Assassinations

1. On 21 November I visited House Select Committee on Assassinations
spaces to review for classification purposes the report Messrs Cornwell
and Klein wrote following the 17 November interview with Sgt Nicholas B.
Stevenson, USAF.

2. The report, about one and a half pages long, listed the participants
in the interview and described generally the substance of the discussions.
Although it did not mention the specific site to which Sgt Stevenson and
Mr. Christensen were assigned, it did say that the facility was able to
collect the Lisbon-Tangier link. The report further mentioned \"intercept\"
and \"NSA\" in several places.

3. I told Mr. Cornwell that as written, portions of the report should
be classified \"CONFIDENTIAL, HANDLE VIA COMINT CHANNELS ONLY.\" He agreed
to classify it and asked me to mark it which I did. I suggested that with
a few changes we could make it unclassified. Mr. Cornwell stated that he
would prefer to retain the original language of the report at this time
but that if it was to be used in any unclassified report by the Committee,
he would then ask us to review the wording so that classified information
would not be disclosed.

4. Mr. Cornwell asked if NSA had determined whether the conversation
Mr. Christensen referenced had been published and disseminated in product
channels. I told him that we had not yet determined the answer to that
question and that we would be back in touch.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: House Assassination Committee Inquiry

1. On 17 November 1978, Mike Smith, GC, and I attended an
interview conducted by staff members of the House Select Committee
on Assassinations in regard to the allegations of Mr. David F.
Christensen concerning the involvement of certain individuals in
the assassination of President Kennedy.

2. The interview was conducted by Messrs Kenneth Klein and
Gary Cornwell and was held in secure spaces provided by Mr. George
Murphy, Director of the Senate National Security Office. Both
individuals are authorized SI access.

3. The interview was conducted under terms of a Memorandum
of Understanding executed between the Committee and OSD on 15 November,
1978 (copy attached).

4. For purposes of the interview, DoD made available Sgt.
Nicholas B. Stevenson, USAF, who had been stationed with Mr.
Christensen at USA-55, Kirknewton, Scotland, in 1963. Sgt. Stevenson
was accompanied by LTC Jeffrey Graham, USAF, Air Force Legislative
Liaison.

5. The Committee staffers were interested primarily in Sgt.
Stevenson's recollections in regard to events described by Mr.
Christensen in a letter to Stevenson written in May 1978.

6. Sgt. Stevenson briefly described the USA-55 site HF ILC
mission and confirmed that the Lisbon-Tangier link mentioned in
Mr. Christensen's letter could have been intercepted by the site
but, to his knowledge, had not been an assigned target. Regarding
the specific allegations made by Mr. Christensen that he had per-
sonally intercepted communications relating to the President's
assassination, Sgt. Stevenson emphatically stated that he had no
knowledge of such an event, though in all likelihood, if it had
occurred, it would have been widely known within the station and
the probable subject of a CRITIC.

7. Mike's and my role in the interview was concentrated largely
on interpreting SIGINT jargon and emphasing the fact that the sites'
mission was and remains properly classified CONFIDENTIAL-HANDLE VIA
COMINT CHANNELS.

8. The staffers made no notes and agreed to let us review their
report, for purposes of classification, on or after 20 November 1978.

9. The staffers remain particularly interested in determining
the name of the individual who Mr. Christensen believes relates to
the assassination. They will explore means of determining this
information to include the possibility of having Sgt. Stevenson
call Christensen and ask him for the identity (Stevenson indicated
his extreme unwillingness to do this. LTC Graham stated that this
request would have to be examined at policy level within DoD).

10. If the Committee is able to determine a specific name,
the staffers indicated that they would probably initiate a specific
inquiry to NSA to again search our materials.

TOP SECRET
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 15 June 1978
SUBJECT: Actions Taken by NSA to Locate Information Related
to the Assassination of President Kennedy
A. Over the past fourteen and one-half years, NSA has
performed a number of separate in-depth reviews of materials in
its files in an attempt to isolate data that might be relevant
to the assassination of President Kennedy. Nothing of significance
has been determined as a result of those reviews.
1. November-December 1963 Immediately after the
assassination, NSAinitiated a large-scale manual and machine
review of available SIGINT, including all U.S./Cuba traffic (NSA
intercepted messages at an average of 1,000 per day at that time).
A computer search was initiated using Oswald's name as the minimum
for research criteria. Additionally, all traffic between Cuba/New
Orleans and Cuba/Dallas was manually reviewed (an analyst involved
recalled that 25 to 50 analysts reviewed the traffic manually,
along with traffic from Cuba and some Soviet traffic). Sometime
during the search, items from the Oswald address book provided by
the FBI were added to the search criteria.
2. 1964 Warren Commission The Commission, in the
person of Allan Dulles, asked NSA to review the exhibits for any
secret writings or codes which might have been contained in the
documents. It also appears that NSA searched records for information
on the basis of other Warren Commission requests made informally
by Allen Dulles.
3. November 1975 Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC):
In response to an SSC request on the Assassination,
NSA reviewed its Soviet and Cuban files, including Cuban military.
The search was also for material involving Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby
or Earl Ruby (a Harvest run was made). Mexican traffic was also
reviewed, looking for information concerning Oswald's visit to
Mexico.
4. June 1976 Pursuant to FOIA requests asking for
material relating to Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination

of President John F. Kennedy, NSA again searched the files.
Strongbox searches were made on the following:
Lee Harvey Oswald 1966 - 1976
Assassination of
President Kennedy 1966 - 1976
Earl Ruby 1966 - 1977
Cobo Cleaners 1966 - 1977
5. December 1976 Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
gence (SSCI) Requested all the material we had available on the
Cuban agent problem. It consisted of 485 reports for the period
1961 1965. All of these reports were received by Committee
Staff Members.
6. March 1978 House Select Committee on Assassinations
Requested all data on Cuban intelligence network and other materials
relating to the Assassination. All Cuban agent material (1961
1964)
was reviewed, as was material that had been previously compiled to
respond to the SSCI and SSC requests.
B. As a result of the reviews described above, the following
materials which may have some relevance to the assassination were
located (referenced material inclosed at numbered tabs):
1. Four Cuban diplomatic messages which contained
official Cuban comments regarding press items that discussed Oswald's
activity in late September 1963 to obtain a visa to travel to
Moscow. There were also comments on the assassination itself.
The messages are dated in the last week of November 1963.
2. Three Cuban military reports which show that Cuban
military forces did go on alert immediately after the assassination.
3. One 1962 Cuban Intelligence message concerning the
assassination of Antonio Veciana. This message was to (Puerto
Rico) SERAFIN.
4. One 1966 Cuban Diplomatic message concerning a Spanish
diplomat in Cuba. It referenced a 1960 plan in Cuba to assassinate
an USSR dignitary in Cuba and against Raul Castro Ruz, possibly
linking it to the CIA.
5. Information in an FBI document relating to a French
Intelligence agent was supplied by NSA. Because this document
was to be turned over to the HASC, there may be some relation
to the assassination.
6. One 1967 message showing Cuban interest in Jim
Garrison's investigation of both the Kennedy Assassination and
David W. Ferrie.

OSWALD had requested a transit visa for travel to the Soviet
Union at the Cuban Consulate ir. Mexico in September, the Cuban
Government requested information from the officials of our
Consulate in that city confirming that it is certain that
Mr. LEE HARVEY OSWALD requested the transit visa for travel to
the Soviet Union on 27 September in the said Consulate..
On being informed by the consular officials that their
office could not grant such a visa without the authorization,
of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations, which likewise
would not grant it if it was not previously authorized by the
country of destination, Mr. OSWALD left the Consulate visibly
disgusted.
The said visa was never granted.
This detail in connection with the other circumstance
that surround the facts, confirm our suspicion that the
assassination of KENNEDY was a provocation against world peace,
perfectly and thoroughly planned by the most reactionary sectors
of the United States:

It is evident that these sectors planned beforehand to
involve Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds.
The inconceivable and inexplicable impunity with which an
individual of known penal antecedents assassinated OSWALD, the
principal accused of the assassination of President KENNEDY, in
the presence of the police themselves and in the (56) of a
prison, demonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable manner
that the powerful reactionary political forces within the \"
United States are making use of all their resources and influences
in order to conceal those who master-minded KENNEDY's assassination,
and the true motives for it.
World public opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds.
It is absurd that the political authorities and the prosecuting.
attorney of Dallas have declared that the case is closed when
hardly 48 hours have passed since a deed of so great a result as
the assassination of the President of the United States.

OSWALD was made the culprit by the police or was prepared to

so as to have responsibility fall on or be insinuated against
those whom the perpetrators wished. It is clear that United
States reactionaries tried to make Cuba and the world the victims
of their criminal designs, even at the price of assasinating
their own president. They sent OSWALD to Mexico to request
a transit visa to Cuba for later travel to the USSR. Imagine

ALERT IN ORIENTE PROVINCE BELIEVED TO BE TERMINATED
The alert in Oriente Province (see 2/0/CUN/R196-63) is be-
lieved to be terainated. The alert, apparently propted by
Prešldant KENNEDY's death on 22 November, was possibly pre-
scheduled to terminate on 25 November. There have been two orders
which suggest that the alert was destined to be concluded on
25 November; they are:
1) Access to the Coastal Observation Post at Punta
Maisi (20-15N 74-05W) was restricted until 25 November because
of the alert (see 2/QS/CUN/R667-63); anil
2) Subordinates of Banes, Readquarters Eastern Naval
District, were to receive further orders on the 25th, presumably
conceming their alert status (2/0/CUN/R196-53); no such orders
have been noted in comamications.
There have been no further references in intercepted communi-
cations to the alert since 02222 on 23 November (2/QS/CUR/R667-63).
It is possible that the restricted access to the Observation
Post at Punta Kaisi extends to other Observation Posts in Oriente
Province such as reported on 23 November when First Army Coastal
Observation Posts were placed in an alert status
(2/21/CITA/P133-63), and that the restriction was to be lifted on
25 November by all those posts.
Further Indication that the alert has terminated is the fact
that the Cuban Navy was engaged in an island-wide communications
exercise on 25 Noveaber. It is considered unlikely that such an
exercise wuld be conducted under alert conditions.
4
There have been no further references to the alert status
of the (D percent Santiago de Cuba) units which was first ob-
served on 23 November (2/31/CA/R05-63). All CRAF and Soviet
Forces Cuba comunications appear to be neraal during this
period, 22-26 November 1963.

(ITEM NO: 8 CONT) THE NEWS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF U.S. SENATOR ROBERT KENNEDY
WAS HEARD WITH INDIGNATION AND DISGUST BY INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.
MANY WORKERS CONDEMNED POLITICAL MURDER AS COMMITTED AGAINST FORMER-PRESIDENT
JOHN F. KENNEDY. THEY PROTESTED SHARPLY AGAINST THOSE EXTREMIST REACTIONARY
CIRCLES WHO, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THEIR ANTIDEMOCRATIC AND ANTICOMMUNIST GOALS,
ARE INCREASINGLY PRACTICING MURDER AGAINST THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND WHO
HAVE INTRODUCED MURDER AS A MEANS OF POLITICAL DUSCUSSION THE THE INTERNAL
POLITICS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MANY WORKERS MADE STATEMENTS SIMILAR
TO THE FOLLOWING: \"KENNEDY'S ELECTION AS PRESIDENT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LED TO
AN ALTERATION OF THE CRIMINAL U.S. WAR IN VIETNAM: THEREFORE HE HAD TO DIE.\"
\"THE REACTIONARY FORCES OF THE USA, REPOONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF JOHN F.
KENNEDY, WANTED TO ERADICATE THE FUTURE PRESIDENT THROUGHT THE MURDER OF ROBERT
KENNEDY, WHO WOULD HAVE REVENGED THE CRIMINAL ASSASSINATION OF HIS BROTHER HAD
HE COME TO POWER.\" B. HALLE HALLE BEZIRK REPORTS (GIST, C.185ØZ, 19 JUN 68,
21/A/274) THAT THE SITUATION IN THE CSSR IS STILL NOT OCCUPYING THE MAJORITY OF
DUSCUSSIONS AND CONTINUES TO DECREASE AS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, ALTHOUGH
GREAT CONCERN HAS BEEN EXPRESSED OVER DEVELOPMENTS THERE, SUCH AS \"THE OPENING
OF THE BORDER TO WEST GERMANY AND AUSTRIA IS A SERIOUS DANGER FOR THE SOCIALIST
CAMP, ESPECIALLY THE DDR.\" FEARS WERE EXPRESSED THAT THIS WOULD ENABLE CERTAIN
ELEMENTS TO FLEE THE DDR THROUGH THE CSSR AND WOULD ALLOW AGENTS AND
REVANCHISTS FROM WEST GERMANY TO BE BROUGHT IN TO SUPPORT THE COUNTER-
REVOLUTIONARY FORCES. IT WAS ASKED: \"HOW ABOUT THE COMMAND POSITIONS OF THE
ARMED FORCES OF THE CSSR--ARE THEY IN THE HANDS OF CONSCIOUS COMRADES OF THE
CZECHOSLOVAK COMMUNIST PARTY (CPC):\" \"WILL THE ARMED FORCES OF THE CSSR FULFILL
THEIR DUTIES WITHIN THE WARSAW PACT:\" CITIZENS WHO HAVE VISITTED THE CSSR HAVE
STATED: \"IN THE CITIES AND VILLAGES OF THE CSSR THE SITUATION IS NO DIFFERENT
THAN EVER. NOW THE PEOPLE LIVE MORE FREELY.\" \"THE CITIZENS OF THE CSSR HAVE
GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THE NEW PARTY AND STATE LEADERS AND FIRMLY BELIEVE IN THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF ORDERLY CONDITIONS.\" \"WHY SHOULDN'T THE CSSR BUILD SOCIALISM
IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER OWN IDEAS: IT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT IF THE SOCIALIST
_ COUNTRIES OERELY OBSERVED, TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT NO NONSENSE HAS GOING ON. LET'S

6. CATEGORY 13-Right Position!
State Council Chairman Walter Ulbricht, head of SED, is no longer a member
of the FDGB Executive. For the first time since the FDGB was founded, he was
not elected to that body at the Sixth FDGB Congress which ended this weekend.
He probably did not allow his name to be included among the candidates because
of the number of his posts. Adolf Hamecke, the initiator of the \"Aktivists
Movement\" in the Soviet Zone, has also left the executive. The newly elected
FDGB executive now has 233 members; previously there were 199. Of this 148
were elected to that body for the first time.
(FEIS 14, 25 Nov) (DUO)

7. SECTION I - Protocol On Exchange of Goods Between Bulgaria And Yugoslavia:
A protocol on the exchange of goods between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia in
1964 was signed in Sofia. During the year Bulgaria will supply Yugoslavia
with machine tools, farm machinery, means of transport, machinery for food
industry, electric equipment, chemicals, and other goods; it will import
from Yugoslavia construction materials, means of transport, engines for ships,
chemicals for use in agriculture, paper, cables, tires, and so forth. The
protocol was signed by Marin M Kralev, head of a department of the Bulgarian
Ministry Of Foreign Trade, and Alexander Druljaca, head of a department of the
Yugoslav State Secretariat For foreign trade.

8. SECTION 111/1 - Germany - First Reaction from People in Karl-Marx-Stadt
to Kennedy's Assassination:
The following is the full text of a rush information report re assassination
of US President Kennedy, from SED Bezirk Ho, Karl-Marx-Stadt to SED Central
Committee, Berlin dated 23 November 1963:
According to a report from Kreis Di ty Brand-Erbis-Dorf streamers of black
crepe were displayed this evening in the Kreis Di ty in connection with the
assassination of the President of the United States.
This is concentrated in particular on two thoroughfares.
Crepe was likewise displayed in the show window of the CDT, on the show
windows at the railroad station, on the board on Bahnhofstrasse; on a wooden
door at the railroad station; in the waiting room of the Reichsbahn and in the
waiting room of the VEB Kraftverkehr.

In addition to this, worker Merkel from Brand-Erbisdorf flew the DDR
flag with red, white and blue bunting this morning. Responsible comrades held
discussion with him.
In Karl-Marx-Stadt opposite the Vin-Weberei-Ausruostung was one wrote in
white oil paint: \"East Germany mourns for Kennedy.\"
A similar slogan was placed opposite the council of Kreis Karl-Marx-Stadt
rural.
Colleague Naumann of the PGH Friseure, ((XG)) Ossietzky Stresse, declared:
\"The Reds did it, there will be a world war for sure.\"

11. SECTION 111/8 - Probable Reference.... ....continuation of:
and move at Thooz. The Regimental Headquarters was then informed by a speaker
at the site that he (the speaker at the site) was going to proceed to the
Nuevitas SAM Site to check out the equipment. This person is believed to be
associated with the SAM Support Facility at Victoria de Las Tunes and was
probably making technical checks of equipment at the Camaguey and Nuevitas
SAM Sites prior to the movement of these sites.
Since the Camaguey site was ordered to practice only three hours prior
to the scheduled time of movement of the site the move may be a mobility
exercise rather than abandonment of the site.
(DIRNSA 2/0/CURUK/R211-63, 2518002 Nov)(TSD)

12. CATEGORY 13 - East Germany: Situation Report No. 112 - Political/Economic:
SHD Communications on 22 November revealed that press, radio and television
had been advised by the Party Agitation Commission in Berlin to \"take note
of a report which indicated Fascist circles in the assassination of President
Kennedy.
Further to para. 2 of 2/AG0/C2463 regarding the murder of one and possible
two East German Taxi-drivers by Soviet Citizens in Dresden, a Berlin Party
official stated on 22 November that further local discussions on the matter
were undesirable since\" ((9 Percent the Soviets could easily get wind of it))\".
A new Church Law ((Amtszuchtsgesetz)) approval at a recent meeting of the
Mecklenburger Landes Synod ((probably the Synod of the Mecklenburger State
Church)) which ended on 9th November, has caused considerable alarm among
party members, the law, the main aim of which is apparently to \"remove\"
clergymen branded as \"progressives\" ((a probable reference to those who voted
in the recent election)), was approved despite the intervention of the Bishop,
who forbade it, and of the party which enlisted at least 15 Clergymen to pose
strong objections, while the party has branded the law as invalid, because
it concerned with the whole of Germany whereas there are two separate German
states. Full reasons for refutation are to be worked out in detail later.
(OCHO 2/400/C2480, 2516442 Nov)(TSD)

13. SECTION THI/8 - Alert in Eastern Naval District Relaxed, 23 November:
As a result of the death of President Kennedy, the Eastern Naval District
of Cuba was placed on an alert on 20442 co 22 November by Banes, Headquarters
for that District. At 20372 on 23 November, the alert was relaxed a certain
degree by Banes; instructions were passed to Santiago de Cuba, a subordinate,
to give leave to 25 percent of their personnel. For the 23rd and 24th and that
further orders would be forthcoming on 25 November 1963.
COMMENT: The authorization to grant leave to personnel is an indication that
the alert is somewhat relaxed and the note that further instructions would be
issued on Monday, 25 November indicates that a non-urgent view has been adopted
for the situation by Cuban Naval authorities in the Eastern Naval District.

1. Cuban reaction to the assassination of President KENNEDY,
as revealed in COMINT, reflected a state of alarm
followed by a cautious correctness. Shortly after
news of the assassination reached Cuba unidentified military
units in Oriente Province, possibly near Guantanamo, were placed
on an alert; units in the Eastern Naval District were ordered
to be ready to repell aggression; and Foreign Minister ROA
instructed Cuban diplomatic missions not to make any statements.
And in an unprecedented move, Havana ordered the link to the UN
to stay open all night. Another message to New York requested
complete data on Lyndon JOHNSON, \"including his political
connections, etc..\" The following day, Havana originated a
message urging a calm objective analysis of the facts and their
possible consequences, stating that both the EISENHOWER and
KENNEDY administrations had been guilty of economic aggression
tending to cause economic ruin and hunger among the people.
Nonetheless, the official Cuban statement issued on the 23rd,
expressed \"deep sorrow\" at the news of the \"tragic death\" of
the President. A Chilean diplomatic message of the same date
reported Havana to be calm but cautious, with only a few

the 23rd, the alert in the Eastern Naval District was partially

to watch for any suspicious airplanes; Venezuela placed all
military units on an alert; and Colombian naval and military

NSASCC Comment: DIA issued an IDIC message (16-63) on 22 November,
urging all Indication Centers to initiate an immediate alert for
possible hostile reactions to the shooting of the President.
Any indication of a change in enemy posture was to be immediately
passed via INDIC channels to DIA and CRITIC messages were to be
used as appropriate.

SOUTH KOREA

2. South Korean Police alerted a counter-revolutionary
plot. The Inch'O'ng Provincial Police Bureau Chief,
on 23 November 1963, issued a message to the Police
Chiefs at Kanghwa, Kimpo, Koyangn, Bupyojng, warning them of a
coup by the Marine Brigade station in Kimpo at 0001 hours 24
November 1963. The Police Chiefs were instructed to \"...keep
a strict watch over movements in the vicinity of this Brigade and
over the movements of forces of the Brigade. The surveillance
will be carried out by under-cover methods. You will assume a
perfect guard setup which will enable you to respond instantly
in an emergency.\" (USM-48, 2/G5/KOP/T 454-63, 25002lZ; 2/G5/KOP/
T 455-63, 2501072)

NSASCC Comment: As of publication there has been no SIGINT
evidence that the coup took place.

This internal NSA report summarizes significant intelligence
developments, arranged by area of occurrence, and operational
developments of general interest. The material contained
herein was selected from SIGINT, collateral and press received
in the NSASCC between 260700z- 2707002 November 1963.

INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPMENTS

CUBA

1. The alert in Oriente province, apparently prompted by the
assassination of President KENNEDY, is believed to have
terminated on 25 November (2027.1). Access to the coastal
observation post at Punta Maisi was restricted only until 25
November, and Eastern Naval District units, which were to receive
further instructions regarding the alert on 25 November, have
apparently not received any such orders. Further, the Cuban navy
held an island wide communication exercise on 25 November. Such
an exercise is unlikely under alert conditions. (2/0/CUJ/R58-63,
2602192)

B-1 Comment: It is possible that the restriction regarding access
to the Punta Maisi observation post extended to other observation
posts in Oriente as well, and that the restriction was to be lifted
on 25 November by all of these posts.

UNITED STATES REPORTED WILLING TO FORGET CAMBODIAN INCIDENT

FR Manila: Embassy; MONISSARA 3 Jan 64 1838
TO Phnom Penh: [M] --
Msg Nr: 1/DGP/X

I was received this morning, Friday 3 January at 1100 hours
by Philippine Foreign Minister LOPEZ. He told me that America
is ready to forget entirely the incident with Cambodia since
Cambodia has already denied having manifested any rejoicing over
the death of (President) KENNEDY. President MACAPAGAL had
an interview yesterday with Mr. LOPEZ and American Ambassador
STEVENSON. The Philippine (Government) thinks that Cambodia
and America will be willing to forget any past incident and
so will accept the formula of a joint statement.

President MACAPAGAL and Mr. LOPEZ wish sincerely to
receive a trusted representative of His Royal Highness in an
interview in Manila. But if, on the contrary, His Royal
Highness wishes for President MACAPAGAL to send a Philippine
representative to Phnom Penh, the President will conform with
the desire of His Royal Highness. Meanwhile, the Philippine
Foreign Minister is ordering Ambassador FAROLAN to return from
Saigon. Unfortunately FAROLAN's son just died in an accident
in Hong Kong.

I have the honor to inform you that during an audience on
23 December 1963, the Philippine Ambassador offered His Royal
Highness the good offices of President MACAPAGAL to resolve the
Cambodian-American différences. Out of Cambodia's friendship for
the Philippines, His Royal Highness accepted the good offices offered,
but not mediation, as was reported in the Philippine radio and press.

demanded of the State Department itself, but of Mr. YOST.
2) Ambassador SPROUSE must stop his investigation to find out
whether the Royal Government and the Khmer people rejoiced over
the death of President KENNEDY.

Therefore, no American Cambodian negotiations are under Philippine
mediation.

The Royal Government was not aware of the proposal to hold
the negotiations in Manila.

Please refute the following: 1) American aid is dangerous
because it is conditional. Please read His Royal Highness' articles
published in the Nationalist [Nyeak Cheat Niyum] on 1 and 8 December
1963. American-Cambodian relations have deteriorated because of
the injustice of the American Administration, aggravated by the
accusation against Cambodia following the death of President KENNEDY
and by the American refusal to guarantee Cambodian neutrality and
integrity. 2) The closing of the Cambodian Embassy in London is not
a political measure but an economic one. Relations between our two
countries will continue and the British Ambassador in Phnom Penh
has been so informed.

FR Phnom Penh: BEAUSSE 13 Dec 63
TO Paris: The Department --
Msg Nr: 1442-44

[3-part message complete]

A visit made to the Takeo province on the 12th gave Prince
SIHANOUK an opportunity to deliver a new speech. The United
States was violently taken to task, and the Prince announced
his decision to recall Mr. NONG KIMNY and almost all the
personnel of the Khmer Embassy in Washington and to leave only
the Cultural Attache there as Chargé d'Affaires. He justified
this step by the United States Ambassador's recent \"protest\"
to the President of the Council against the \"hate campaign\"
initiated in Cambodia following the death of Marshal THANARAT,
a campaign which did not spare President KENNEDY's memory.
Threats of a complete break were even made in the event that
the hate campaign continued.

The Prince also took up--but much more moderately--the
question of relations [1 gr M] Vietnam and stated that the
Vietnamese Government had already been able to seize one of
the Free Khmer transmitting stations and hoped to discover the other
one soon. He added that Mr. TRAN CHANH THANH, former Vietnamese
Ambassador to Tunisia, was to come to Cambodia at any moment to
begin negotiations but that he was maintaining the five
conditions that he had set up for the resumption of normal.
relations with South Vietnam.

Finally, the Chief of State announced the forthcoming arrival
of Mr. MESSMER and a French delegation and expressed his confidence
in President DE GAULLE, \"who [1 gr U] Cambodia; but,\" he strongly

Mr. T. Jeremy Gunn
Executive Director
Assassination Records Review Board
600 E Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20530

Dear Mr. Gunn:

(U) In response to your letter of November 28, 1997, we tasked
appropriate elements of the NSA Operations and the NSA Archives elements to
search for information responsive to your questions. In addition, a member of
my staff reviewed our United States Intelligence Board (USIB) and USIB SIGINT
Subcommittee record holdings. The following represents the composite
response of these elements.

(TS-CCO) Question #1: What were NSA targeting priorities and capabilities
against Cuba in Mexico City during the period 1963-1964? Including
records of the U.S. Communications Intelligence (COMINT) Board,
what records does NSA possess on tasking and results from these
capabilities? In particular, did NSA target communications between
Havana and Mexico City? (During the meeting Messrs. Hatch and
Fogarty suggested that the Army Security Agency had a facility in the
American Embassy in 1963 targeting the Cuban Embassy, although its
operations did not meet with great success.) Mr. Hatch stated that
Mr. (Howard K.? Harold? Johnny?) Johnson, a former NSA employee,
might have more specific knowledge of such an operation and that you
could contact him.

(TS-CCO) ANSWER: A record of the SIGINT Subcommittee of the USIB
from August 1993 provides a recap of the USIB SIGINT Subcommittee's Priority
National Intelligence Objectives. Included in this recap are objectives
[requirements] to obtain information on 1) Soviet and Cuban military
capabilities, 2) Soviet and Cuban capabilities, intentions, and efforts to initiate
or support internal warfare in other countries, 3) critically important political,
economic, and scientific and technical developments in Communist countries
[USSR, Cuba]; actual or potential conflicts within the ruling groups, major
developments in Soviet and Cuban external policy, and 4) the reactions of Latin
American governments and peoples to developments in and with respect to
Cuba.

(TSC) An NSA COMINT Technical Report (A5/A6 COMINT TECHNICAL
REPORT #1-66- A Survey of Soviet Communications in Cuba) regarding SIGINT
results of the targeting of Cuba was reviewed by Dr. Hall. This appears to be the
most comprehensive record of our capabilities against Cuba for the 1963-1964
timeframe. Numerous Cuban cryptosystems were exploited during the early
1960s, including some Cuban military and illicit agent communications
through depths or diagnosis and exploitation. NSA had an excellent capability
to meet the SIGINT challenges of the 1960's. We had field sites in position to
copy the signals of interest in Cuba, and those communication exchanges
internationally between countries.

(TSC) Product reports based on the targeting of Mexican Diplomatic
communications were reviewed by two members of my staff. Some of these
reports were the result of targeting of communications between Havana and
Mexico City. However, no records responsive to the John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Act of 1992 were located other than those already passed
to the ARRB. There were no reflections in any of these products of any activity
that might have been related to the assassination, only post-assassination
reflections of U.S. political and protocol developments. NSA has approximately
12 shin boxes [4 linear feet] of Mexican Diplomatic records.

(S) In early December 1997 the ARRB staff was provided with the name
and phone number of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command
(INSCOM) historian who has information regarding an Army Security Agency
(ASA) collection site in Mexico City during the 1963-1964 timeframe. The
INSCOM historian is Jack Finnigan who can be reached on 703-706-2630.
Mr. Finnigan advised us of information contained in an ASA unit history report
that was written by J. Johnson. In addition, I understand that members of your
staff met in December 1997 with Mr. Frederick Berghoff, former Chairman of
the National SIGINT Committee (previously known as the USIB SIGINT
Subcommittee), who provided the ARRB staff with his recollections of NSA
activities regarding the Central and South American Regions in the early-1960s.

(U) Question #2. What, if any, additional NSA capabilities were added to target
communications sources within Cuba between November 1962 and the end of
1964? What information does NSA have on the targeting of communications
sources within Cuba by CIA? Was there any liaison between NSA and CIA on this
issue? NSA stated that it may have between six and twelve boxes of Cuba-
related material. Of what do these records consist? May the ARRB staff examine
these records?

RFK, AND THE REV. DR. MLK, JR.

Doc ID: 6878946 TOP SECRET UMBRA

(TS-CCO) ANSWER: The records of the USIB SIGINT Subcommittee for
the period November 1962 through 1964 were recently reviewed. No SIGINT
Objectives were included in the SIGINT Subcommittee's objectives regarding
Mexico for the 1962-1964 timeframe. The August 1963 SIGINT Subcommittee
record recaps SIGINT Objectives and the 5 and 18 November 1963 and the 10
January 1964 records indicate that requirements to target Soviet forces in Cuba
and Soviet-Cuban Agreements were already receiving priority SIGINT coverage.
The 2 December 1963 record appears to show a change in priorities because it
presents \"pertinent examples of actions underway or planned...\": 1) increase in
intercept and more timely consolidated reporting on Cuban military problems,
2) intercept and analysis of communications related to illicit...activity...seeking
information on Cuban illicit nets in particular., 3) A new attack on the problem
of tracing the movements of Cuban subversive agents and of travel by Cubans
into the U.S., the Soviet Bloc and Latin America, 4) Additional ship and airborne
intercept of Cuban communications is planned, and 5) Increased efforts to
develop information on the technical characteristics of the internal military and
paramilitary communications of all Latin American countries.

(TS-CCO) NSA collectors, based on their personal recollections, were
alerted to put greater emphasis on Soviet Block and Cuban military targets to
look for signs of increased readiness in their force posture. Analysts at NSA
were also looking for signs of diplomatic reactions to, and foreign intelligence
reporting on, the assassination. Any voice and cipher traffic was thoroughly
processed from the surrounding timeframe. Analysts on targets that were
unexploitable from a cryptanalytic standpoint reviewed traffic patterns to
ensure that no deviations indicating unusual activity had been overlooked.

(S-CCO) A review of the United States Intelligence Board (USIB) records
held by NSA shows CIA and NSA top-level Agency cooperation/coordination on
intelligence targeting via the USIB. However, according to recollections of
individuals working at NSA in the mid 1960s, liaison between CIA and NSA for
the 1962-1964 timeframe was limited and no record of CIA/NSA cooperation/
coordination at the working levels of the agencies was located. We searched for
records of CIA targeting of Cuban communications, but no records were located.
However, the USIB records make repeated reference to Committee on Overhead
Reconnaissance (COMOR) Biweekly Report on High-Level Coverage of Cuba with
the caveat that the information was distributed through restricted channels.
Because we do not have copies of the COMOR reports, we are unable to
determine if the tasking of these missions was limited to PHOTINT, or if SIGINT
was also performed from the overhead vehicles. COMOR was the predecessor
of the SIGINT Overhead Reconnaissance Subcommittee (SORS). The SORS
committee is a subcommittee of the current U.S. SIGINT Committee. The
Chairman of the SORS is Mr. John Berwin (phone number: 202-496-9828).

(TSC) Regarding the \"six to twelve boxes\" discussed during our meeting
with Dr. Hall and members of the ARRB Staff in November 1997, these boxes
referred to are records regarding Mexican Diplomatic communications. As
mentioned in response to Question #1, a recent review of these records did not
result in locating any records not already identified as responsive to the JFK
Assassination Records Act. The ARRB staff is welcome to examine these
records as well as any other of the records mentioned in this letter. The records
pertaining to Cuba and Mexico for this timeframe held by NSA have been
researched and those believed to be responsive to the John F. Kennedy Records
Act of 1992 have been provided to the ARRB.

(S-CCO) Question #3. What capabilities and targeting priorities did NSA have against
Cuba outside of Mexico City and Cuba itself during the time period 1960-1964?
What records of this targeting and any results might still exist?

(TSC) ANSWER: For the timeframe 1960-1964 NSA targeted and was
successful in collecting Cuban communications to/from its Embassies and/or
diplomatic missions in: Algiers, Athens, Bamako, Beirut, Belgrade, Berlin,
Brussels, Bucharest, Conakry, Colombo, Copenhagen, Djakarata, Geneva, The
Hague, Hanoi, Helsinki, Karachi, London, Lisbon, Moscow, New Delhi, Rome,
Santiago, Sofia, Tel Aviv, Ulan Bator, Vatican City, Prague, Accura, Cairo, Paris,
and Vienna. We maintain copies of SIGINT product reports, which are NSA
reports based on the intercept of communications, for this period. Those
reports deemed responsive to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of
1992 have been forwarded to the ARRB.

(TS-CCO) Question #4. What policy recommendations from the time period 1960-64
might still exist which reflect NSA policy making or tasking on Cuban
diplomatic or military communications outside of Cuba?

(U) ANSWER: As stated previously, the USIB SIGINT Subcommittee
records show the objectives (requirements for targeting) and are available for
review by ARRB members or staffers.

(S-CCO) Question #5. Are there any COMINT Board recommendations or tasking on
the targeting of Mexican communications during the period 1963-1964? Does
NSA have any other independent knowledge of these targets?

(S-CCO) ANSWER: No recommendation specific to Mexico was located,
however, the USIB SIGINT subcommittee record of 2 December 1963 presents
as one of the \"pertinent examples of actions underway or planned...:\"
\"Increased efforts to develop information on the technical characteristics of the
internal military and para military communications of all Latin American
countries\".

(TS-CCO) Question #6. Including all records of the COMINT Board, what records does
NSA have that refer to the targeting of any Soviet assets in Mexico City that
were in place during the period 1963-1964? What were NSA capabilities and
targeting priorities against Soviet targets in Mexico City from 1963-1964?

(TS-CCO) ANSWER: No records referring to NSA targeting of Soviet
assets in Mexico City were located. Our interest in Mexico and our capability
against any targets in Mexico City was very limited.

(S-CCO) Question #7. Did NSA produce a Technical SIGINT Report (TSR) on Mexican
capabilities in 1963?

(S-CCO) ANSWER: A search for any Technical SIGINT Reports or similar
documents was performed in January 1998 but no records documenting NSA's
capabilities against Mexican target for the period 1960-1964 were located.

(S-CCO) The ARRB staff was provided with the name and phone number
of an INSCOM historian, Mr. Jack Finnigan (Phone Nr. 703-706-2630), who has
information regarding an Army Security Agency collection site in Mexico City
during the 1963-1964 timeframe. In addition ARRB staff members met with
Frederick Berghoff, the former Chairman of the National SIGINT Committee, to
obtain some \"recollections\" from Mr. Berghoff regarding NSA's interest and
capabilities regarding Mexico in 1963.

(U) If you have any questions or need additional clarification regarding
the information provided, please contact either Lee Schroyer or Claudia Collins
of my staff on (301)688-6798.

TOP SECRET

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY

OF DEFENSE (INTELLIGENCE)

SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee Queries to NSA Concerning

the Warren Commission

Reference your letter dated 14 January 1976 transmitting

a request from Mr. Alton Quanbeck of the Senate Select

Committee Staff. The following information is provided in

response to Mr. Quanbeck's letter, keyed by paragraph to

his letter (inclosed - see underlined portions). Most of

the information was made available to the SSC Staff, Mr.

Jim Johnson, during an interview with Dr. Louis Tordella

on 20 January 1976.

Para. 1. NSA requested permission to retain

photocopies of those reports on which we had worked merely

as record copies of our efforts on behalf of the Commission.

It was felt that if a question should arise at that time

concerning what analytic efforts had been involved and the

number of manhours expended, a record copy would prove useful.

No operational use was made of these documents except to

hold them on file for a period of time which cannot now be

determined. To the best of our present knowledge, the photo-

copies have now been destroyed. Absolutely no results

relevant to the assassination were obtained through NSA's

analytic look at the exhibits. The Commission, in the person

of Mr. Allan Dulles, had asked Dr. Tordella, informally, to

review the exhibits for any secret writing or codes which

might have been contained in the documents. Dr. Tordella,

after causing a careful review of the documents by NSA crypt-

analysts, reported verbally to Mr. Dulles and other Commission

members that nothing whatsoever had been achieved by the

analytic effort. No written reply was submitted.

Doc ID: 6878938 Doc Ref ID: A4268794 10288

Serial: N0078

Para. 2. NSA is uncertain as to what is precisely

meant by these comments, but we assume that the comments on

names refer to our biographic files which are maintained on

foreign personalities of potential intelligence significance.

As the Committee knows, these biographic files are maintained

(now at CIA incidentally) as analytic support. It is also

possible that the Commission was referring to the fact that

names are frequently seen in traffic collected for foreign

intelligence purposes and therefore NSA might have access

to foreign names not otherwise available to the Intelligence

Community.

Para. 3. It may well be that CIA did obtain such

transmissions and pass them to NSA for analysis, but no one

presently working that analytic area recalls such a request.

Discussions with Dr. Tordella also failed to shed any light

on this subject. There are no files or records which we have

been able to locate from that time frame which would sub-

stantiate such a claim. In fact, the only file the responsible

analytic group has been able to locate concerning a request

from the Warren Commission deals with a file compiled from

open sources citing major dates in the last months of Oswald's

life. Presumably the date file was to be compared with NSA

product on/about the key dates in the hope that something

could be deduced. The file does not contain any \"hits.\"

The analysts who performed this effort have since retired.

Para. 4. The informal request from Mr. Dulles is

the known total extent of NSA's role in assisting in the

investigation. The file discussed in Paragraph 3 is the only

file thus far recovered. There is no information which can

now be identified which was developed from Cuban or Soviet

transmissions relating to the assassination.

Para. 5. We have no information on this subject

at all. However, pursuant to the subject raised during the

Tordella interview, we have searched our files manually,

and as Mr. Lowman agreed during the Tordella interview, we

have recovered three product reports (Inclosures 2 through

4) which show that Cuban military forces did go on alert

immediately after the assassination. There is no SIGINT

evidence, however, that the Cuban forces were alerted prior

to the assassination, thereby suggesting that they had prior

knowledge of the event.

Mr. Thomas K. Latimer

Special Assistant to the Secretary

U. S. Department of Defense

Washington, D. C. 20301

Dear Tom:

In connection with the Select Committee's investigation of

the assassination of President Kennedy, we earlier received

answers to certain questions put to NSA. Since then we have

examined other material pertaining to NSA's contribution to

the Warren Commission's investigation and we desire further in-

formation from NSA.

By way of background for this request, we note the Warren

Commission provided NSA various documents and asked NSA to re-

view them for any cryptological significance. NSA found no

cryptological significance and its report of this fact was pub-

lished by the Commission.

1. By letter of July 10, 1964, (a copy of which is attached)

Mr. Rankin provided General Blake a copy of certain documents

requested by Dr. Tordella for NSA's files. Since NSA's analysis

of the documents was apparently completed at the time of Rankin's

letter we wish to know why NSA wanted to keep these documents

for its file. Further, we wish to know what use, if any, was

made of these documents and what results relevant to the assassina-

tion were obtained from such use.

2. In a Commission staff internal memorandum, discussing the

documents provided NSA, it is reported that NSA is \"primarily

interested in names,\" and NSA claims it has \"information on names

which the CIA does not have.\" Assuming these statements are ac-

curate, we wish to know what significance such names would have

to NSA and what information on names NSA had that CIA did not.

If names had significance, what names did NSA use in its analysis?

3. We are informed that CIA obtained transmissions from the

Soviet Embassy in Mexico City for November or December 1963 and

that it may have passed these to NSA for analysis. Did NSA re-

ceive these transmissions or any transmissions relevant to the

assassination inquiry? ? Did it analyze them? What were the re-

sults of its analysis?

4. We are interested in learning the extent of NSA's role in

assisting in the investigation of the assassination. In that

connection, please inform the Committee the extent of NSA files

relating to the assassination. Please provide the staff of the

Committee access to those files. Please provide the staff with

a summary of all information NSA developed from Cuban or Soviet

transmissions relating to the assassination.

5. We have been informed that after the assassination the

Cuban government instructed its embassies and consulates to re-

turn all files on Oswald to Cuba. What information does NSA

have on whether such instructions were issued?

6. In connection with the answers to questions 4 and 5, please

indicate whether such material was provided the Warren Commission

and provide copies of all documents evidencing that fact.

We would appreciate receiving a response to these questions

as soon as possible and to expedite this inquiry we are sending

a copy of this letter to Mr. Foster of NSA.

NOTE OF CONDOLENCE ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
[TELEX CONVERSATION BETWEEN:]

Santiago: Foreign Minister ORTUZAR 22 Nov 63
[and]
Washington: Ambassador GUTIERREZ OLIVOS 88
Msg Nr: 423

[w.] In the first place, I would like to receive the instructions
requested in my telex of 1500 hours. Then, according to
what you say, permit me to make some suggestions regarding
the statement which the President of the Republic will
surely make.

[s.1 First, let me say that as soon as we learned the tragic news,
the President of the Republic, accompanied by the Foreign
Minister and the Minister of the Interior, visited the
United States Ambassador to express the grief and sorrow
of the government and people of Chile. The President has
sent a cablegram to Mrs. KENNEDY and to the new President
of the United States, expressing his condolences. Also,
the Foreign Minister has sent a similar cablegram to the
Secretary of State. National mourning has been decreed
for three days. The President has already made a statement
which in a few moments will be given to the press and which
I shall send to you. Likewise, the Foreign Minister will
make a statement. As far as instructions, while they are
being prepared, it seems necessary and indispensable that
you proceed to express to the United States Government the
condolences of our government and our people, in the fol-
lowing manner: Real consternation reigns here, because
President KENNEDY was loved and admired by the people of
Chile, who knew that he always understood our problems.

The text of the President's statement reads as follows:
\"In the face of the unexpected and tragic news of the
death of the President of the United States of America,
Mr. JOHN F. KENNEDY, the President of Chile is convinced
that in expressing his profound and innermost sorrow, he
also speaks for the sentiments of all Chileans.
\"President KENNEDY gave the world a new concept of peace,
of justice, of liberty and of democracy. His idealistic
and constructive concepts were, in the field of action,
becoming realities which have come to signify for the
people the hope of a more just and more free tomorrow.
\"His tragic death is not only mourned by the sister
republic of the United States of America. It is the
whole world, which in these hours feels the sorrow of
an irreparable loss. Chile shares, fully, this grief
because she found in him profound comprehension of her
problems and a spirit always determined to help us.
\"Santiago, 22 November 1963.\"
Please make the suggestions you feel advisable as you
announced above.

[w.] Because of the present situation in Washington and the
prevalent atmosphere in Congress in respect to the
foreign aid program, particularly in respect to the
Alliance for Progress, to which I have referred at length
in previous cablegrams and notes, I think that the tragic
death of President KENNEDY should not pass without very
explicit reference to said program, of which he was the
creator and the most ardent defender, even to the point
that there were times when the maintenance of the
Alliance in American circles was entrusted almost ex-
clusively to the personal battle that he maintained on
all opposing fronts. For this reason, I am suggesting,
knowing that it would be very well received in circles
of the Administration of the United States, that in
President ALESSANDRI's statement a very special ref-
erence be made to the President as author and struggling
defender of the Alliance, pointing out the urgent neces-
sity for the United States and all the Latin American

peoples to make of the Alliance, that is of its realities,
a \"living monument\" to the life and concepts of this great
man. This is my suggestion.

[s.] At this moment, we are seeing whether or not the President's
statement has already been released to the press, in order
to be able to make an addition.
The statement has already been released to the press as we
have transcribed it to you. However, we will make use of
any further declaration to take your suggestion into
account.

[w.] The declaration that will be reproduced by all the news-
papers of the (XG) since probably later declarations will
be confused under the deluge of important reactions from
many sources. I ask, finally, if it would still not be
possible to send the newspapers an additional paragraph to
the statement already sent, having in mind that if the
President's statement has just been sent, it could not be
actually published yet but would be in the morning news-
papers tomorrow. The same step should be taken in ref-
erence to the texts sent to the wire services.

[s.] Unfortunately, the statement previously mentioned has already
been transmitted by radio; therefore, it is impossible to
make any changes.

of KENNEDY.

They likewise placed (B val armored cars) to prevent
attack and a police guard at the residence and the chancery.

DE GAULLE'S ATTITUDE AT TIME OF KENNEDY'S DEATH IMPRESSES MANY

FR Accra: GROUSSET 27 Nov 63
TO Paris: The Department Most Immediate
Msg Nr: 180-81

[2-part message complete]

A religious service in memory of President KENNEDY was held
yesterday afternoon in the church in Accra. A particularly large
crowd, mostly Africans, literally; overflowed the Porticoes.
Contrary to the practice of President NKRUMAH, who never
participates in religious ceremonies, several members of the
government and the President of the Supreme Court of Justice were
present. Except for the Cuban and Chinese ambassadors, the chiefs
of the diplomatic missions were in attendance.

-President NKRUMAH broadcast a message to the nation exalting
the personality of the late President \"who will be extolled in the
annals of humanity for his action against racism and his efforts
in favor of peace and human rights.\"

President DE GAULLE's act of attending the funeral in person
and the wording of his two messages to Mrs. KENNEDY and to the
new President of the United States impressed many of my colleagues
and members of the government, who praised the human and political
aspects of our President's attitude.

TO Paris: The Department --
Msg Nr: 289

The tragic death of President KENNEDY has aroused deep emotion
here. President NYERERE last night convened the Council of Ministers,
whose decisions he did not, however, make known; he said he was too
overwhelmed to make a statement. Today has been declared a day of
national mourning. (B val Government offices), banks, and schools
are closed.

FRENCH AND SYRIAN COMMENTS ON POPE'S TRIP

FR Damascus; SEBILLEAU 11 Dec 63
TO Paris: The Department --
Msg Nr: 752-55

[4-part message complete]

When the Syrians learned that the Sovereign Pontiff had
decided to go to Jerusalem, they hastened to express their
satisfaction, as they always do every time they note any sign
of interest whatsoever shown by foreign countries with regard
to the Near East. Then they went on to express the hope that
the Pope would not fail to note, during his pilgrimage, the
harm which Israel had done to the Arab people of Palestine..

Finally, the tone in which the Israeli radio, which is
listened to here more than is acknowledged, praised the event
prompted them to formulate a few reservations, and a Damascus
newspaper went so far as to wonder whether President KENNEDY'S
assassination, the attempts made in the Council to reinstate
the Jewish people, and finally the pontifical pilgrimage were
not all part of a plot instigated by Zionism to facilitate the
diversion of the waters of the Jordan.

I did not think it necessary to report these reactions,
which were as ridiculous as they were inevitable, to the
Department, since I preferred to wait [2 gr G] adopt a position
by engaging in conversation first with the Chargé d'Affairs
of the Holy See, then with the Apostolic Internuncio, who
hurriedly returned last night from Rome. This morning, on
leaving the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Monseignor PUNZOLO
was good enough to relate to me the conversation which he had
had with the Minister. Mr. MURAYID protested in rather moderate
terms against the fact that Israel is seeking to exploit the

pilgrimage he expressed the hope that the latter, although
it is to take place partly in Israel, would not imply recognition
of that state by the Holy See. Finally, he stated that the
Syrian Government wished to invite PAUL VI to visit Damascus,
the city of Saint Paul, during his trip.

The Apostolic Internuncio told me that he had evaded this
last point by suggesting that the invitation, which will certainly
be refused, be made by the Syrian Embassy at the Holy See.
[1 gr G] gave me the impression, with regard to nonrecognition,
that he had reassured the Syrian Minister and had given him
to understand that the Holy See itself was hardly pleased
with the manner in which Israel was seeking to exploit the
Pope's pilgrimage. Talking with me on this matter, he was
altogether frank, going so far as to say that the Israelis
would be well advised not to go too far along the path which
they have entered, if they do not want to run the risk of
a serious setback and wish to avoid having made \"so many
(B val noisy preparations) [2 gr G].\"

I wonder, since I know a little about Rome, whether the
Holy See has addressed Tel Aviv in such plain language, but
I confess that I was surprised by that which I heard from the
mouth of a prelate who had just received his latest instructions
from the Secretariat [1 gr U) the previous day.

FR Peking: AMBAGUINEE 23 Nov 63
TO Conakry: President of the Republic Priority
Msg Nr: 856AGP6307

I have the honor to inform you of the following:

I learned from an unofficial source that Premier CHOU EN
LAI will leave Peking on 13 or 14 December for an official visit
in Egypt whence he will visit other African countries, among
them Guinea, Ghana, Mali. [5G] not have confirmation of this
information despite several demarches to Chinese Protocol.
This discretion seems due to the fact that the Chinese Govern-
ment is (B val using) every means to avoid a reoccurrence of
the assassination attempt to which President LIOU CHAO CHI was
subject when he visited Cambodia.

I continue my investigations. I will keep you informed
as soon as possible.

As I finish this telegram, I learn of the assassination
of President KENNEDY. The British flag has been furled and
creped since this morning.

Very high consideration, MOMO BANGOURA

For Osagyefo from RIBEIRIO, Repeat to BOTSIO.

Representatives from all states to President KENNEDY's
funeral, scheduled for Monday noon, include Heads of State,
Prime Ministers or Foreign Ministers. In view of this and
protocol involved, I consider Ghana's delegation inadequate
and would humbly advise that considering your own personal
friendship with the KENNEDY's, that you send the Foreign
Minister or Speaker of the National Assembly or Minister
BENSAH, Chief of Protocol, to give prestige and political
importance to your representation. President KENNEDY's interest
in Ghana and his personal regard for you was such that I feel
sure a ministerial representation at his burial would be greatly
appreciated by Mrs. KENNEDY and the administration and further
strengthen good relations between Ghana and the United States.

I should be most relieved if you would graciously and
favorably consider my suggestion. Representatives should catch
Sunday's Pan American flight due here same night.

DE GAULLE AND ERHARD THE TWO MOST PROMINENT MOURNERS

FR Washington: Iranian Embassy, FOROUGHI 27 Nov 63
TO Teheran: Foreign Office Priority
Msg Nr: 139

After 23 hours of flying, I arrived in Washington Saturday
at about 0200 hours in the night. The welcoming formalities were
carried out by RUSK and the top officials of the State Department.

Mr. RUSK was assigned to meet all foreign representatives,
even the heads of state.

Two kings and the Queen of Greece, eight presidents, three
crown princes, and four members of royal families, thirty prime
ministers and foreign ministers attended these ceremonies; but with-
out any doubt at all the outstanding personality at this gathering
was General DE GAULLE, and the next most outstanding was ERHARD,
despite the fact that the German President was present too.

The funeral ceremonies were splendid and magnificent, and it is
said that Washington has seen nothing like them since the burial of
the Unknown Soldier.

After the internment ceremonies, all the representatives went
to the White House so that Mrs. KENNEDY might thank them. While
talking with H.I.H., Mrs. KENNEDY said, \"I thank the great King of
Kings of Iran very much for sending Your Highness to Washington
on his behalf to attend my husband's funeral.\" Moreover she men-
tioned her pleasant memories of the days when their two majesties
were here.

Then the new president received all the representatives in
the White House and thanked them. In this reception Mr. JOHNSON

spoke privately with His Highness and me and the Imperial Am-
bassador; and he described his good memories of the time of his
visit to Iran; and most of his talk was about H.I.M.'s revolu-
tionary reforms, which he lauded and praised; and he expressed
pleasure at the progress and development of these reforms.

In the conversation with the Presidents of France and Germany
and the Crown Princess of the Netherlands all spoke of the pleasant
memories they had of their visits to Teheran. In general the con-
versations gave each one a chance to praise the revolutionary re-
forms of the king of kings.

His Highness left today for Florida. After staying a couple
of days there he will go to New York, and on Saturday he will leave
from New York. All the representatives left in the course of last
night and today.

Naturally the Secretary of State these past few days has been
busy with work for the new government, and probably it will not be
possible to arrange a meeting with him. However, Mr. TALBOT is
coming to the embassy tomorrow for some discussions. For luncheon
also a few top State Department officials have been invited to the
embassy.

I am leaving for New York tomorrow afternoon and on Saturday
am going to Europe with His Highness, and Monday I shall be in
Belgrade. Details by post.

FRENCH REACTIONS TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S DEATH

FR Paris: Embassy 23 Nov 63
TO Rome: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 1889

Signed BROSIO.

The death of President KENNEDY has made an enormous impression
in France and aroused an emotion [8M]. Government circles, beginning
with DE GAULLE, immediately forgetting (4G) differences with the
United States, are unanimous in exalting the image of the deceased
President.

At the same time concern is not being concealed over the
internal evolution of the United States, where political differences
and the race conflict run the risk of being intensified.

On the international level, it is believed in Paris that the
West has lost a leader of major prestige and force and that this will
not fail to have repercussions on East-West relations.

JOHNSON is considered an obscure figure and a man, despite his
(B val political) experience, of minor caliber, with the consequences
of depriving the United States for [5G) a year, (B val that is),
until the (B val next) elections, of any effective political direction.
With the approach of the presidential elections the first signs
were already (B val noted) of hesitation and indecision which
diminished the capability for decision by the United States, and
the death of President KENNEDY risks paralyzing (7G) Washington
with unforeseeable consequences on both the domestic and the
international levels.

ITALIAN REPORT ON ΜΙΚΟΥΑΝ TALKS IN THE UNITED STATES

FR Washington: FENOALTEA 29 Nov 63
TO Rome: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 1454

On the subject of the conversation which MIKOYAN had with
President JOHNSON, the Department told us that it does not yet
have a record of the conversation. As far as our interlocutor
knew the conversation was of a general nature. MIKOYAN, after
expressing the sincere sorrow of the head of the Soviet Govern-
ment and the entire Soviet population for the tragic death of
President KENNEDY, expressed hope that relations between the
two countries could continue to develop peacefully in conformity
with the KENNEDY policy. President JOHNSON gave assurances that
it is his firm intention to keep the preceding line of policy
unaltered.

MIKOYAN then met with RUSK.

The conversation lasted about an hour. The Department told
us that MIKOYAN began by repeating the ideas expressed to JOHNSON,
and RUSK assured him that the change of Presidents did not mean
a change in the foreign policy of the United States. In spite of
the fact that the two countries have different positions on many
international questions--RUSK continued--it is necessary to
explore the area of common interests even if it is not possible
to conclude formal agreements.

The conversation was then devoted to problems of disarmament,
limitation of the arms race, and reduction of military expenditures.
Particular importance was given to the question of nondissemination

of nuclear arms. On this last aspect MIKOYAN repeated the well-
known Soviet thesis concerning the incompatibility between an
agreement on nondissemination and the establishment of a NATO
multilateral force.

Bilateral problems were then briefly mentioned and RUSK
expressed hope that discussions on a consular agreement and
negotiations on cultural exchange can be fruitful.

RUSK then concluded the talk by affirming that, on the
broader international problems, the United States will discuss
the Western position with its allies in December.

CHINESE DELEGATE DISRUPTS WORLD PEACE COUNCIL

FR Warsaw: AILLAUD 28 Nov 63
TO Rome: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 1357

I learned that in Today's inaugural meeting of the World
Peace Council, on which I am reporting in a dispatch of the
same date, Professor LANGE, Polish Deputy Chairman of the
Council of State, opened the work by expressing his profound
sorrow over the death of President KENNEDY and affirming that
his passing must be considered a serious loss for humanity.
The French delegate MADAULE expressed similar sentiments, pro-
posing that the entire assembly join in them. While all the
other delegations were agreeing on this proposal, a Chinese
delegate seized the microphone and, despite the Chairman's
attempts to prevent his speaking, since the intervention of the
Peking delegation had not been requested according to procedure,
stated, shouting, that KENNEDY's death should not be mourned
since he was the principal exponent of aggressive Capitalism
and that if there should be grief, it should be expressed for
all those who had died through the crime of aggression of the
capitalist system, personified especially by the United States.
A profound silence in the Assembly followed the untimely re-
marks of the Chinese delegate, after which work was resumed.

PORTUGUESE REACTION TO DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

FR Lisbon: YOSHIDA 26 Nov 63
TO Tokyo: Foreign Minister Priority
Msg Nr: 75

President KENNEDY's untimely death was a great shock to
the Portuguese people and is mourned by all the government and
private citizens alike. The government immediately announced
three days' mourning (the same as for Pope JOHN XXIII) and all
flags on government buildings are at half-mast. The press
has been reporting the event day after day but so far without
editorial comment.

We inquired of the authorities about the effect of KENNEDY's
death on Portugal, and their view may be summed up as being that
the new President will continue KENNEDY's foreign policy and
there will be no particular change regarding Portugal and
in particular the Portuguese colonial problem.

TOKYO SUGGESTIONS FOR STATEMENT ON OUTER SPACE ISSUE

FR Tokyo: OHIRA 4 Dec 63
TO United Nations: Japanese Delegation Very Urgent
Msg Nr: 1034

Reference your Nr. 1962((A)).

1. There is no objection on the whole, but in Paragraph 39
\"entire resources\" sounds too strong and might better be \"toned
down\".

2. In Paragraph 30, the passage from \"the government of
Japan\" to \"program\" is not quite accurate. We suggest
substituting something like the reference to IGY in Mr. OKAZAKI'S
statement in the First Committee last December.

3. In the first part of Paragraph 33, the reference to the
launching of two Kappa rockets in May should be corrected to
[B val one], and the payload of the Lambda should be corrected
to 180 kilograms.

4. Regarding Paragraphs 34 and 35, recent developments are
as follows:

(a) The Kagoshima Space Center will conduct its second
Lambda test on 10 December.

(b) There were successful tests of television relay by
satellite between Japan and the United States on 23 and 26 November.
(Two tests on each date.) The second test on 23 November conveyed
the sad news of the assassination of President KENNEDY.

meeting with the new President JOHNSON, and has decided to visit
America in the spring of next year, etc., and the relationship

dampened the above expectations.

ences.\" Chairman PAK, who arrived in the U.S. for a five-day
period, was accompanied by a party of six. (SCNR Public Infor-
mation Officer LEE HU RAK, CIA Deputy Director SIN CHIK SU,
Foreign Ministry Protocol Chief CHO'NG TO SUN, Commander of the

we will have political stability will be decided by the results of
these elections. Through its election activities during the 30
days, the party in office, the Democratic Republican Party, has
appeared for a guarantee of a stabilizing force in the future to
carry out its firm policies. The flood of opposition parties,
including the Civil Rule Party, opened a fierce struggle to block
the guarantee of a majority policy by the party in power under the
slogan \"Check government dictatorship.\" In their general election
campaign they did not confront the [Democratic Republican Party]
policy and they began an attack which offered no counterproposals.
The Central Election Management Committeechas made every prepara-
tion to manage this historic day's election cleanly and fairly.
When voting has been completed at the 7400 polling places through-
out the country it has been decided that the ballot counting will
begin immediately at the 196 vote counting stations. It is felt
that the results of the elections will be fully confirmed on the
afternoon of 27 November. (Seoul Sinmun)

3. According to what was learned from the Central Election
Management Committee on the afternoon of 25 November, the number
of voters in the 26 November National Assembly general elections
has confirmed as 13,344,022. The total number of absentee voters
was set at 373,701 persons. The nationalppopulation as of today
is 26,278,025. The number of voters represents 50.76 percent of
the population. (Seoul Sinmun)

4. On the morning of 25 November Prosecutor General CHO'NG
CHANG UN told a press conference, \"It is extremely regrettable
that the disclosures of public officials election violations in
such places as Mokp'o, Hamp'yo'ng, P'aju, and P'yo'ngt'alk were
originated by a number of overly loyal officials who disregarded
the real meaning of the Government's pledge that the elections
would be unprecedentedly clean. \"He went on to say, \"It is a
fact that the P'aju Hamp'yo'ng case had already taken shape and
the people knew everything; however, because the Mokp'o Police
Superintendent said that he alone had taken part in the Mokp'o
case, evidence on the Police Superintendent is now being collected
so that public action may be taken. This not expected to extend

beyond the Police Superintendent. It is extremely regrettable that
the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Director of the Police Bureau
took the moral responsibility for this matter and resigned. I
hope that these cases will serve as a warning to overly loyal public
servants.\" (Seoul Sinmun)

5. KANG KI CH'O'N, the Chairman of the SCNR Legislation and
Justice Sub-Committee said on the morning of 26 November that steps
would be taken to lift restrictions on 266 persons including former
President SYNGHAM RHEE and former Prime Minister CHANG MYO'N, who
had been constrained under political law. Chairman KANG said that
the SCNR Home Affairs Committee is now giving final consideration to
a list of persons. He said that in accordance with the instructions
of Chairman PAK these persons would be freed no later than
17 December. (Kyo'nghyang Sinmun)

6. On the morning of 25 November Democratic Republican Party
spokesman SO IN SOK stated, \"Prior to election day the opposition
parties have been acting to disclose a plan for election violations
by public officials.\" The following are examples of this.

a. With two documents drafted by KIM YO'NG SIK an Andong
City Hall official the Civil Rule Party is scheduled to make two
disclosures of election violations by public officials.

b. He said, \"The Civil Rule Party is planning to make
disclosures by two unidentified officials in addition to the above-
mentioned KIM YO'NG SIK.\" He maintained that it was evident that
most of the above facts were brought about by bribes and were un
true. (Kyo 'nghyang Sinmun)

1. The news of President KENNEDY's death caused great grief
mixed with anxiety among the local population. The morning and
evening editions of Friday's newspapers were (B val delivered)
and sold out in a short time. I heard that it was necessary that
the crowd which gathered in front of the American Embassy be

4,000 residents signed the special book. At the religious ceremony
arranged by the ambassador, the church filled and overflowed.

Flags were not half-masted on any official buildings. Although the
Foreign Minister went to the embassy and personally expressed their

service. Furthermore, the government was content with charging
their American representative to participate in the ceremony in

against world peace and co-operation and is expressing anxiety
that the new American administration will change its policies under
extreme rightist influence.

PRESS COMMENT ON KENNEDY'S DEATH AND JOHNSON'S ACCESSION TO
PRESIDENCY

FR Helsinki: Embassy 27 Nov 63
TO Ankara: Foreign Ministry
Msg Nr:

38.

The incident of the killing of the United States President
KENNEDY caused great indignation and grief in Finland. A sort
of period of national mourning was established in Helsinki with
flags lowered to half-mast everywhere. On the 25th of the
month in the city of [3 gr G/M], a Mass was arranged in which the
President of the Republic will also participate. All means of
publication are discussing the exceptional personality of KENNEDY
and his service to humanity and peace.

The press, taking up the personality of L. JOHNSON who
ascended to the presidency unexpectedly, wrote that the afore-
mentioned in his yourh was a protégé of ROOSEVELT and went to
Australia and New Zealand as his special representative during
the war; that he was one of those who defended the [1 gr U] at
the time. The press added that, although he has great influence
especially in internal politics and in the party, his
experience in the matter of foreign policy expanded by his trips
after 1961; that following the Moscow agreement, he made a
statement to the effect that he saw the possibility of nuclear-free
zones [1 gr M] created; that, however, he supported the idea
that it was necessary not to abanden caution because of the belief
that the cold war will continue; and that in 1959 KHRUSHCHEV

As was submitted during his visit to Helsinki several months
ago, the impression which he left as a statesman (1 gr G) is
negative.

Some of the opinions expressed in official and political
circles are as follows: the incident of the death of the presi-
dent is of a nature to alter conditions of domestic policy;
in spite of the certainty of KENNEDY's Democratic Party candidacy
in the future elections, now the party will be the scene of a
great dispute; however, from the struggle between the [1 gr U]
and liberal wings of the (1 gr G) party, it can be expected that
NIXON will be the victor.

The primary point which these circles [1 gr U) upon is
that the incident of the sudden withdrawal from the scene of
KENNEDY whose personality was forcefully felt on east-west
(B val relations) which are taking a favorable direction despite
the [1 gr G) deviations recently, [1 gr G) destructive reactions
on these relations.

I attended all the ceremonies, the procession, the mass, the
burial, the reception by the KENNEDY family, and the reception by
the President. I saw the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
from Tunisia, who assured me that Tunisia will send us an acknowledge-
ment to our request for recognition, but he is not able to give
an' approximate date. He will remain in New York to attend [a
meeting of] the Security Council. Therefore, I asked BAHI LADGHAM,
the number two man to President BOURGUIBA, to accelerate [matters].
He promised me to take care of it when he returns to Tunis, which
will be in a few days. I have also asked WAHLEN, Head of the Swiss
Department for Policy, which is the same as the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, who also promised me to see about an acknowledgement of
receipt if this has not yet been done.

At the customary presentation President DE GAULLE asked me
if things were improving in our country. I told him they were
getting better.

UN DISARMAMENT TALKS REPORTED

FR New York: Polish Mission to the UN 22 Nov 63 1900
TO Warsaw: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Routine
Msg. Nr. 484

For RAPACKI

In accordance with your instructions in Nr. 12173ª LACHS continued talks
on disarmament with the Americans along these lines:

A. Inspection points plus threats is one of the possibilities.

B. Formal unilateral steps, actually simultaneous reductions by
both sides.

Talks with a representative of the Department of State: In recent talks
with GROMIKO, the USA proposed the destruction of a certain number of bombers
by both sides without inspection. GROMYKO did not turn down the proposal.
They are ready to expand the idea to include rocket launchers and other types
of weapons also without inspection, in order to comply with the reservations
of the USSR. He considers a formal agreement on future reductions or a freeze
too difficult to attain next year because of elections. A confidential agree-
ment is possible.

Information of KENNEDY's assassination was received during the discussion.
The reaction: Eliminates the possibility of any steps for elections and
freezes the situation.

UN HONORS KENNEDY

FR New York: Polish Mission to the UN 27 Nov 63 1930
TO Warsaw: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Urgent
Msg. Nr. 495

For WINIEWICZ.

1. Tuesday's plenary session was devoted exclusively to honoring KENNEDY's
memory and there was very little occasion for political declarations. The
chairman agreed with all the delegations that only vice chairmen (13, among
them, the great powers), the chairmen of the seven committees, and the ex-
chairman of the assembly will appear.

A. FEDORENKO, appearing in the name of all the Socialist countries,
and the Bulgarian expressed hope that KENNEDY's policy will be continued. The
Romanian's appearance was without political accents.

B. The Western delegations emphasized European solidarity with the
States except the Frenchman, who limited his appearance to expressions of
sympathy.

C. The Latins and Asians stressed the necessity of international
agreements, the Africans the continuation of the process of decolonization.

2. The leading motive, authorized by JOHNSON, of STEVENSON's declaration
was the continuation of efforts to reach agreements through negotiations and
full support for UN activities to \"uphold the peace.\" However, the formu-
lation of the thesis that there will be no JOHNSON policy as there was no
KENNEDY policy can be interpreted as a signal that the new administration
intends to have a free hand also in matters begun by KENNEDY. From our con-
versation with American delegates we deduce that they do not expect a change

in the State Department. STEVENSON will probably remain until elections.
They flatly denied the rumors that at the beginning of 1964 they will renew
intrigues against us at the session (article 19 which deals with the loss of
vote) on the question of payments for the Congo operations and UN forces in
the Near East (see our Nr. 478)ª.

From the constant emphasis that the new administration in Washington
will concentrate on internal matters and that it needs time before it will be
capable of conducting an active foreign policy, we surmise that they fear
pressure from our side.

3. The tempo of the session slowed down but we will be able to adjourn
before the holidays. To date there are no signs that the atmosphere is
worsening.

REPORT ON CASTRO'S TELEVISION SPEECH REGARDING PRESIDENT
KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION

FR Havana: INDONESIA 24 Nov 63
TO Djakarta: DEPARLU --
Msg Nr: 42

For: First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Info: North American Directorate.

From: NABI.

No. 29.

1. In connection with the accusations in the U.S. press
that OSWALD, accused of assassinating KENNEDY, was a pro-CASTRO
communist, Prime Minister CASTRO spoke before Cuban television,
a summary of which follows.

2. Cuba is remorseful and has gained no advantage by the
assassination of KENNEDY.

3. The accusations of the U.S. press have no foundations
whatsoever, and are only the activities of the ultra reactionary
group in the U.S. whose intentions are to depreciate the names
of Cuba and the Soviet Union.

4. CASTRO thinks that JOHNSON will not be as strong as
KENNEDY since he was not elected president by the people directly.
He will not be as influential as KENNEDY in damning up the
strength of the ultra reactionaries in the U.S. who pursue
policies which are extremely hostile and very dangerous to the
Soviet Union and Cuba..

5. In short, that was the speech,

The interesting thing is that while the Soviet Union
only answered these accusations with an article in the
newspaper and expressed their sorrow in a meaningful manner
by sending Deputy Prime Minister MIKOYAN to Washington, CASTRO
considered it necessary to answer the accusations of the U.S.
press officially as Prime Minister in a speech at a time when
friends and enemies of the U.S. generally were expressing their
respect for KENNEDY. Also interesting is the fact that he not
only defended Cuba but the Soviet Union as well.

From BUSUMTWI-SAM for Osagyefo, the President, repeated
to FOREIGN, Press Accra.

The following statement of Zanzibar coup d'état has just
been issued by the Uganda Minister of Information, Broadcasting
and Tourism:

\"Who deposed the Sultan of Zanzibar? Many people in East
Africa have reacted to the revolution in Zanzibar where the
government has been overthrown and the Sultan deposed. They,
have now formed their own opinions as to whether the coup d'etat
was good or bad. But unfortunately not much attention has been
paid to the methods or the means used to bring about the
revolution. But for the sake of record and history, it is
good to try to establish who was responsible for the overthrow-
ing of the government and setting up a new one; future generations
would benefit by such an exercise, as with the assassination of
President KENNEDY of America, the name of Cubans and Communists
has been drawn in by the western press reporters. Is it true
that the Cubans organized the coup or not? What would motivate
Cuba to do so? Has Cuba any interest in the islands, if so, what
are they? When I went for the Zanzibar Independence Celebration,
I met Cuban representatives in Zanzibar. They had been invited by

the government which has been overthrown now, which meant that
the government was friendly to them. But it was there on
10 December 1963, at the Palace of the Sultan in front of which
lay the ship SALIFKALIF, which has carried the Sultan away,
that a top ranking British officer who was to leave Zanzibar
the following day after many years of service there, told me
that he was sorry, only for one thing, namely, that independence
of Zanzibar had come before the formation of the East African
Federation, because he thought Zanzibar might become a Cuba to
the East African mainland. Now how could Cuba overthrow another
Cuba? Cuba being so far away from Zanzibar, how would the Cubans
get into Zanzibar and by which ship? The truth is that the former
government was a socialist government which was friendly to
Cairo, Indonesia and Cuba. The following points are of prime
importance: The British Commissioner of Police, Mr. SULLIVAN,
was not attacked in spite of the fact that he was in charge of
the only armed force in the country. The Sultanes Palace was
not attacked immediately-unlike in the Russian Revolution. Only
Indians were in fact reported to have been captured and imprisoned
although the British also owned property on the island. The
British and Americans were reported quite safe in the European
club. The American Project Mercury, worth [4 gr G) million,
was never attacked although it is ironical that the Sultan
should now feel that he would be safe in Dar-es-Salaam where
Mr. BABU, who is now the Foreign Minister, and most probably
Mr. KARUME were, at the beginning of the revolution and from
where, unlike other people they could leave for Zanzibar during
the revolution, without any apparent difficulty. The former
government asked for assistance, but the new government asked
Tanganyika for medical assistance. Mr. KISASA was immediately
appointed by the revolutionary council, to take over the key and
most strategic position of Commissioner of Police, a sign of
great confidence.\"

1. CUBAN REACTION TO DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

On 27 November Brazilian Ambassador Eustian Pinto in

Havana reported the following: (ELD 2027-63
CIN 1V75-63)
\"Soon after the death of [President]

Kennedy several authorities and persons associated

with the Cuban Government openly expressed to us their

concern relative to the consequences in regard to

Cuba and were unanimous in believing that any other

President would be \"even worse.\"

\"Another concern of the Cubans was expounded

in the unexpected speech by Fidel Castro on Sat-

urday when he accused the news agencies of trying

to connect the Soviet Union and Cuba to the crime

and accepted that the reactionaries of the United

States are trying to create 'a state of anti-Soviet

and anti-Cuban hysteria.'

\"Further, yesterday the Foreign Ministry in

an official communique confirmed that the indicated

assassin tried to obtain a visa to Cuba without

success and repeated that reactionary sectors tried.

in that way, to involve beforehand Cuba and the
Soviet Union in the events and are trying now to
cover up the masterminds and real motives for the
crime.

\"There was no official announcement here of
sorrow for the death of the President of the United
States.\"

Note: On 23 November the Chilean Ambassador in Havana had
reported the following:

\"The reaction in Havana to the assassination
of President Kennedy has been calm but cautious.
Only isolated Communist groups have shown any re-
joicing. The radio and newsreels are reporting
objectively and in a correct manner, without show-
ing regret ----- [words missing] statement by the
government. The newspapers are printing today the
statements of the Cuban Ambassador to the United
Nations.\"

*On 23 November Cuban UN delegate Lechuga stated in New York that
Cuba had received the news of the tragic death of President Kennedy
with deep sorrow; that all civilized men always grieved about such
events; and that this was the feeling of the people and Government of
Cuba.*

1. A plot exists to assassinate PAK CHONG-HUI, President
of the Republic of Korea (ROK), on 17 December, the date
of the presidential inauguration. The ROK Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Police Bureau are
investigating the plot uncovered by the ROK CIA which holds a
recording of a conversation between two individuals in which
the planned assassination was discussed. No decision has as yet
been reached on whether the two individuals will be arrested at
this time. (TDCS-3/567,099,10 December 1963 CONFIDENTIAL NOFORN)

The \"PLANALTO\" net, used by high ranking government officials
including the President and ministers of the armed forces,

coming controversial official statement. On 4 October when
GOULART requested that a state of siege be declared, the Army
declared situations \"CRUZ\" and \"EXTRAORDINAIRIO\".

CAMBODIA

3. Prince SIHANOUK is highly incensed with the U.S.
Government according to a British report of 12 December
out of Phnom Penh (2030.1). He has drafted a stinging
reply to the American Ambassador's protest over official celebra-
tion by the Cambodian Government of Marshall SARIT's death, which
by implication was linked to that of President KENNEDY. SIHANOUK
also intends to break off U.S./Cambodian negotiations over the
termination of economic and military aid, giving AID and MAAG
personnel five days to leave Cambodia, withdraw Cambodian Ambassador
NONG KIMNY from Washington, and abandon his proposal for a
conference to guarantee Cambodian neutrality and independence.
(TDCS-3/567,264,12 December 1963 NOFORN; 3/O/CED/T215-63, 1215232)

B2 Comment: SIHANOUK carried out one of the above intentions on
11 December, when the Cambodian Foreign Ministry instructed NONG
KIMNY to immediately return all but one of the embassy personnel.
NONG KIMNY is to leave on the next ship, while the one member of
the embassy being left behind to handle Cambodian students will
stay at the Ambassador's residence while the Chancellery is put
up for rent. It was stated, however, that the withdrawal of
embassy personnel was not to be interpreted at a breach in dip-
lomatic relations with the U.S.

CHINESE COMMUNIST

4. The British Military Attache in New Delhi has received
reports that the Chinese Communists have pulled back
from the Sino-Indian Border, and the Indian Director
of Military Intelligence continues to send indications of \"quiet\".
A return to more routine communications within the Tibet Military
Region is substantiated by recent reappearance of practice traffic
on groups serving military authorities in the area. Practice

REPORT ON MEETING BETWEEN U.S. PRESIDENT AND PAKISTANI AND INDONESIAN
MINISTERS

FR Washington: TAKEUCHI 30 Nov 63
TO Tokyo: Foreign Minister Priority
Msg Nr: 3127

1. President JOHNSON met with both ABDUL NASUTION, the
Defense Minister of Indonesia and Pakistan's Foreign Minister,
ZULFIQAR BHUTTO, separately. NASUTION, in response to the concern
expressed by the President abouť Indonesia's attitude toward
Malaysia, replied that Indonesia herself would not attack, but
would defend herself if attacked. I understand that the meeting
was profitable. The President expressed his concern to BHUTTO
saying that he hoped to reaffirm friendly relations between America
and Pakistan and asked that both Presidents get together soon.

2. At the time of President KENNEDY's death, President AZIKIWE
of Nigeria wrote to President JOHNSON saying that this assassination
indicates that there are deeply rooted feelings against the American
Negro, and that there is a need for serious consideration by the
African people as to whether or not they can trust the U.S. because
of the strong elements which discriminate against the Negro, and
whether or not the UN should be moved to another country. I under-
stand that President JOHNSON without answering the criticism
directly made a written reply on the 29th of November to the effect
that the U.S. would keep trying to promote equal human rights.

Information Bulletin Nr. 51, 26 November 1963.

I. Washington, 24 November (DROZNIAK)。

After JOHNSON's first meeting with members of government and congress an
even more general opinion [25-50M] internal will be continued by him in:
principle, although by different methods. It is believed that the role of
RUSK and the State Department will grow greater. JOHNSON is to assure
MIKOYAN that he will follow KENNEDY's line. MIKOYAN's presence (at the funeral]
is evaluated as KhRUShCHEV's gesture of good will and his intention to follow
the same policy toward the USA [25-50M] DE GAULLE: the wish to take advan-
tage of JOHNSON's inexperience to play the role of a man of providence and
solidarity with the USA.

B. JOHNSON will concentrate on consolidating his position in the party
and country. He assumes that he will be a candidate in the elections. In
both parties [25-50M] is expected. The Republicans believe that their chances
have improved.

II. New York, 25 November. (Information received from LEWANDOWSKI.)

The struggle on the political implication of the assassination continues
between the right and groups close to KENNEDY. It will probably pass to the

foreign and domestic policies of the new president. Even though the right
was unable to raise anti-Communist feelings in the nation and thus force
JOHNSON's immediate abandonment of the KENNEDY line, it is, however, widening
its influences. Its representatives in Congress began an open attack of
KENNEDY's policy of looking for agreements with the Soviet Union, and thus
emphasized the hope that JOHNSON will not be such a \"green politician.\"
Western European and Scandinavian delegations with whom we talked avoided all
speculations on the outcome of the meetings with MIKOYAN, DE GAULLE and ERHARD.

III. Berlin, 24 November.

According to United States Armed Forces Radio in Berlin, a state of full
alert of the Bundeswehr was announced in the FRG on 23 November after KENNEDY's
assassination. The tone of the FRG propaganda was sad, and in a form not
offensive to the right emphasized that KENNEDY's policy was favorable to the
FRG. The massive funeral displays were organized only in West Berlin and not
in the FRG. This discounted KENNEDY's attitude towards West Berlin and is an
attempt \"to fall in line with KENNEDY's successor.\"

IV. Lagos [25-50M]

AZIKIV in a message considers KENNEDY a victim of racial hatred. He
questions the retention of UN offices in the States. All commentaries play
up the racial question.

V. Rio, 23 November.

A. According to the embassy the change in the USA shocked political
circles who now expect USA policy towards Latin America to take a turn to the
right.

B. The domestic situation is tense. Fear of a crisis with violent
outcomes exists.

VI. Paris, 24 November.

According to French and German press circles, DE GAULLE during his meeting
with ERHARD placed emphasis on the establishment of a friendly atmosphere.
The talks were of a probing nature. The differences of opinion: According to
ERHARD, Europe must be firmly allied with the USA and according to DE GAULLE
the reverse is desired. ERHARD believed that USA-USSR dialogue was useful

(by maintaining certain borders and concessions from the USSR). According to
DE GAULLE, the dialogue was not necessary and gave no results. ERHARD raised
the importance of trade with Socialist countries.

VII. Baghdad, 25 November.

Before the formation of the government, three groups appeared in the
officer corps:

A. The Nationalists (who) demanded liquidation of the Ba'ath,

B. [a group which] agreed against the inclusion of the Ba'ath in the
government but without its liquidation,

C. [one which] demanded the inclusion of the Ba'ath in the government.

ARIF announced a non-partisan government whose aim is the consolidation of
the nation. The officers gave him an ultimatum: Complete the consolidation
in eight weeks or resign, the government will not represent any party, allow
the Ba'athist to take part, release all political prisoners. Ba'ath supporters
defeated the liquidation of the national guard which is only disarmed, the
cadres (20-40M) the nationalists [25-50M]

VIII. Damascus, 23 November.

According to the embassy, HAFEZ's conciliatory tone towards ARIF and his
justification of the events in Iraq is due to his desire to save the Ba'athists
in Iraq. A break with Iraq would indicate a breakdown of the policy [25-50M]
Syria as well as bringing ARIF closer to NASSER. From this stem the compli-
ments to ARIF and strong attacks on NASSER.

IX. Havana. 22 November.

According to a Venezuelan source, the National Liberation Movement is
establishing permanent representation in Havana, increases its contacts, and
intends to establish representations in Europe the first being in Prague.

since the original groups of insurgents were not accomplishing

The Shwe mam Sayadaw said he was about to set to work and
that on a (B val holy day) in the month of Tabaung he would
deliver a sermon which would deal with (XM) the danger of communism
and how it seeks to thwart religion. He said he would also speak
on how the Revolutionary Government (3G) (B val misrules) the

BELGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER EVALUATES PRESIDENT JOHNSON

FR Brussels: SPAAK 23 Nov 63
TO Washington: Belgian Embassy --
Msg Nr: 275

Reference my telegram Nr. 274((A)). I also answered the
following question:

Question: Mr. Minister, might I also ask you a question?
You have met Mr. LYNDON JOHNSON several times. May we ask you,
on the basis of the conversations which you had with him in
Brussels, what your impressions of the new President of the
United States are?

Answer: Well. It is true that I had the good fortune to
have talks with the new President of the United States, scarcely
two weeks ago, and these talks inspired my confidence. I had
the feeling that the Vice President completely shared President
KENNEDY's political ideas. I believe that he is a very ex-
perienced man and that there is no reason to doubt his wish to
follow President KENNEDY's policy. Therefore it is necessary
to have confidence and to work with him with the same desire for
co-operation as that which we showed to President KENNEDY.

((A)) Available if required. [The Foreign Ministry transmits to
Embassy Washington the text of Mr. SPAAK's statement by
radio on 23 November on the death of President KENNEDY.]

1. Members of Unidentified Soviet Unit Receive New Regulations

A conversation of 14 November 1963 1/ held on an unidentified R-4 radio
relay training net (believed to be internal), Group of Soviet Forces Germany
(GSFG), between two unidentified speakers disclosed the following concerning
the reception of new regulations:

Speakers (A) and (B) were engaged in a long conversation concerning
communications. At the completion of this routine communications chatter,
Speaker (A) remarked that they would not be training until one o'clock (a.m.
or p.m. not indicated) the next day. He then told Speaker (B) that he had been
spending some time reading the new regulations [NOVYJ USTAV]. Speaker (B)
replied that he had seem them, the 1963 ones. He added that he wanted to read
them through but hadn't (yet) been able to do so. The remainder of the conversation,
parts of which were garbled, dealt with training courses, type not disclosed.

Comment: The new regulations referred to are probably the 1963 edition of
a Soviet publication which can best be described as a basic field manual for the
soldier. This manual contains instructions pertaining to the Soviet soldier's
conduct, manual of arms, squad, platoon, company and battalion tactics, etc., as
found in separate U.S. manuals.

2. News of President Kennedy's Assassination Passed on Soviet Multi-Channel
Facilities

A conversation of 22 November 1963 2/ held between two unidentified speakers
revealed that the news of President Kennedy's assassination was being passed on
the Moscow to Hq GSFG, R-4ØØ radio relay line.

Speaker (A) asked if Speaker (B) had heard about Kennedy. Speaker (B)
replied that they hadn't heard anything on the [commercial) radio yet and were
waiting for the latest news. Speaker (A) stated that in his opinion Kennedy
was already dead, having received a fatal bullet wound. Without further comment,
the speakers began talking about their communications.

1. VENEZUELAN AIR DETACHMENT HAS ORDERS TO DESTROY ENEMY
PLANES OVER VENEZUELAN TERRITORY

Beginning at 1330Z on 25 November, the newly established
Venezuelan \"Capri\" air detachment, has been ordered to co-ordinate
with navy units to intercept, destroy or counteract enemy air
incursions of Venezuelan territory. This air detachment, to be
stationed at Coro (11-25N 69-41W), will also join navy and national
guard units in patrolling the coast of Falcon state.

Several U/I planes have been reported over Falcon state
since 7 October. The establishment of the \"Capri\" detachment
elements defensive measures ordered on 28 October against planes
suspected of supplying the guerrillas of Falcon. These flights,
according to previous Venezuelan military reports, are apparently

EXECUTIVE SESSION

Wednesday, February 11, 1976

United States Senate,
Select Committee to Study Governmental
Operations with Respect to
Intelligence Activities,
Washington, D. C.

The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:20 o'clock
am., in Room 608, Carroll Arms Hotel, the Honorable Richard
S. Schweiker presiding.

Present: Senator Schweiker (presiding).

Staff: Paul Wallach, Ed Greissing, Jim Johnston, Dan Dwyer
and Frederick Baron, Professional Staff Members.

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

PROCEEDINGS

Senator Schweiker. Will you stand and raise your right
hand.

Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to
give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?\"

AMLASH Case Officer. I do.

Mr. Johnston. First of all, sir, we'll start with some
procedural matters. I'm not going to ask you to state your
name for the record because we have agreed before beginning
here today that you would testify under an alias so as not to
jeopardize your ongoing activities.

Is that the way you understand our agreement?

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

TESTIMONY OF AMLASH CASE OFFICER

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. Is that satisfactory to you?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. Now, you understand that at any time we
refer to your participation or your authorship of a document or
receipt of a document, we are prepared to substantiate the
reference that we are making, and we are not trying to avoid
proving the fact that it is indeed you that were involved in
the incident. It is simply because we were not able to use
your name.

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Now, you've previously testified before this
Committee, and I assume you've had a copy of the Committee
rules, and we have another copy available in case you want to
refer to them.

And are you appearing here voluntarily today without
a counsel?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, I am.

Mr. Johnston. Do you understand that at any point during
this examination you are free to stop answering any questions
and request the advice of Counsel?

AMLASH Case Officer. I do.

Mr. Johnston. And do you understand as well that all your
constitutional rights are intact here before the Committee

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 including the Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent, if you
2 choose.

3 AMLASH Case Officer. I do.

4 Mr. Johnston. All right.

5 Let me state that the purpose of this interview is to
6 refine and clarify certain questions about the AMLASH operation

7 It is my understanding that you were the case officer on
8 the AMLASH operation from the time period, say, of the first
9 of September on through, for all relevant purposes, December '67,
10 and November '64, is that correct?

11 AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

12 Mr. Johnston. At this time you were a member of what was
13 called the Special Affairs Staff, is that correct?

14 AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

15 Mr. Johnston. And that's abbreviated SAS.

16 AMLASH Case Officer. Right.

17 Mr. Johnston. Would you describe your position in SAS
18 and your relationship to Mr. Fitzgerald, who was Chief of
19 SAS?

20 AMLASH Case Officer. I was a special assistant to Mr.
21 Fitzgerald, charged with the responsibility of attempting to
22 organize a military coup inside Cuba against Fidel Castro.

23 Mr. Johnston. Did you report directly to Mr. Fitzgerald
24 on your work?

25 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, I did.

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Johnston. Was there anyone else knowledgeable in
2 SAS of what you were doing?

3 AMLASH Case Officer. Only the other people who were
4 involved working on the project.

5 Mr. Johnston. What was the relationship between SAS and
6 the Western Hemisphere Division under, at that time, I believe,
7 Mr. J. C. King?

8 AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall exactly what the
9 organizational relationship was at that time. I do know that
10 we operated on a somewhat I wouldn't say autonomous basis
11 from the Division itself, but the chain of command was certainly
12 from Mr. Fitzgerald, not necessarily through the Division
13 Chief, but up to the DDP at that time.

14 Mr. Johnston. Who was Mr. Helms.

15 AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

16 Mr. Johnston. In other words, there could be direct
17 reporting from Mr. Fitzgerald to Mr. Helms.

18 AMLASH Case Officer. Oh, yes.

19 Mr. Johnston. Is it necessary that Mr. King was knowledgeable
20 of all operations of SAS?

21 AMLASH Case Officer. Not necessarily. I don't know if he
22 was kept fully advised of all the operations or not.

23 Mr. Johnston. Did he know generally what you were doing?

24 AMLASH Case Officer. I presume he did, yes.

25 Mr. Johnston. And how often did he and Mr. Fitzgerald

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 meet to coordinate. They do coordination of their work?

2 AMLASH Case Officer. I don't know. I wasn't involved
3 in that part of it.

4 Mr. Johnston. Was SAS targeted directly at Cuba, or
5 were there other countries under its jurisdiction?

6 AMLASH Case Officer. No. SAS was strictly a task force
7 set up to deal with the Cuban problem.

8 Mr. Johnston. And finally on this general matter, who
9 did who gave the counterintelligence support for SAS operations?

10 AMLASH Case Officer. We had a Counterintelligence Branch
11 within SAS.

12 Mr. Johnston. Who headed that in the fall of '63?

13 AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall. There was a change.
14 I don't recall the name.

15 Mr. Johnston. Let me as I stated earlier, you of
16 course have testified before, and I have before me the
17 transcript and I'm not proposing really to trap you in any nature
18 with this transcript. However, there are some things that were
19 not asked before that I would like to clarify.

20 First of all, how and why was AMLASH first contacted to
21 set up the September meeting that you attended?

22 AMLASH Case Officer. He had been contacted the year before
23 in Helsinki, and we found out at that time that he was coming
24 out to a sporting event in the Western Hemisphere, so we went
25 down and contacted him.

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Johnston. In my review of the file and I don't think
2 we have the document here today, but my notes indicate there
3 was a cable from Langley to Rome on 19 June 1963, that is in
4 the AMLASH file.

5 AMLASH Case Officer. Would you repeat the question?

6 Mr. Johnston. In my review of the AMLASH file, there is
7 a cable from headquarters to Rome on 19 June 1963 which states
8 that AMWILIP,, who was your contact with AMLASH, had sent a letter
9 as part of \"an activation effort to reluctant dragon.\"

10 I ask , do you have any recollection or any knowledge
11 that this was a sign to AMLASH that CIA was back in contact
12 with him or wanted to go back in contact with him?

13 AMLASH Case Officer. I can't comment on that because
14 I didn't get into the operation until September of '63, and
15 this took place before I became involved in that part of the
16 AMLASH operation.

17 Mr. Johnston. So in other words, you're saying you don't
18 really know who made the contact with AMLASH?

19 AMLASH Case Officer. We had contact with AMLASH from the
20 year before. He had been contacted by a CIA case officer in
21 Helsinki.

22 Mr. Johnston. In July and August, 1962.

23 AMLASH Case Officer. Right.

24 Mr. Johnston. Then he returned to Cuba.

25 AMLASH Case Officer. And this was the first time, to

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 the best of my knowledge, that he had come out from Cuba
2 since the Helsinki trip.

3 Mr. Johnston. In other words, you're not aware of any
4 prior contact between CIA or an intermediary and AMLASH?

5 AMLASH Case Officer. Not between that period of time.

6 Mr. Johnston. All right. You met with AMLASH in Brazil
7 on September 5th through 9th. I don't mean you specifically,
8 but the general meetings with AMLASH were in that time frame.
9 Is that your recollection?

10 AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

11 Mr. Johnston. Do you recall seeing a cable, or receiving
12 instructions from headquarters to the effect and this is
13 after your series of meetings instructions to the effect
14 that headquarters felt that AMLASH appeared hopeless as an
15 intelligence performer, and should be approached as a chief
16 conspirator allowed to recruit his own cohorts. He should
17 be urged to recruit a few trusted friends to assist him
18 initially in FI and ops reporting and then progress to sabotage
19 and more serious matters on a more orderly basis.

20 Do you recall seeing something to that effect after your
21 Brazil meetings with him?

22 AMLASH Case Officer. I don't specifically recall the cable
23 itself, but certainly that would be in line with the thinking
24 at that time.

25 If I may state, he was not considered a controlled asset,

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 shall we say, and it was somebody with whom we felt that we
2 could collaborate in organizing the internal group.

3 Mr.Johnston. But my summary of the cable would indicate
4 that on September 9th, or after your meetings in Brazil, you
5 really didn't think of him as a gatherer of information, but
6 as someone who wanted to go on to other things, as a
7 conspirator of some kind.

8 AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

9 Mr. Johnston. The file also has a document in it, the
10 AMLASH file, dated 16 September, marked OFPA 72775. I don't
11 really know what an OFPA is.

12 AMLASH Case Officer. It's a dispatch.

13 Mr. Johnston. In any event, it reports a transcript of
14 the conversation, and to the best of my ability to understand
15 the document, it's a conversation of an intercept in the Cuban
16 Embassycin Paris The document says \"Mary: I don't want to
17 imagine things, but this thing of\" AMLASH uses his real
18 name. I have sanitized this \"Moreno. It is either a
19 tremendous secret or a top secret matter.\" And then there is an
20 unreadable portion, and then a word either \"treason\" or
21 \"reason\" I'm not sure what is referred to, and then a partici-
22 pant whose name is Betty says, \"I believe it is a top secret
23 matter.\"

24 My question to you is, did you, in September of '63, know
25 about this intercept?

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 AMLASH Case Officer. I don't specifically recall today
2 that I would have known about it. I presume if we had it in
3 file, that I was working with it, that I would have seen it.

4 Mr. Johnston. Do you have any information about any recollec-
5 tion about something on this order?

6 AMLASH Case Officer. No.

7 Mr. Johnston. And assume that at least the portion I
8 quoted seems to reflect on the Cubans' view of AMLASH'S
9 activities in Paris.

10 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, it may have. As I recall, I
11 think that he was also at that time I may be wrong, and we
12 would have to go back to the files to check, but he was rather
13 outspoken to some of his closer friends in the fact that he was
14 no longer happy with the revolution, with Castro.

15 Mr. Johnston. I don't want to dwell on this, if you don't
16 have a recollection, but this conversation seems to indicate
17 that the employees in the Cuban embassy think that AMLASH is
18 there on a top secret mission.

19 AMLASH Case Officer. Probably so because of his independent
20 way of comportment. He didn't answer to anybody.

21 Senator Schweiker. What was his role in government at
22 that point?

23 AMLASIH Case Officer. He was excuse me, this must have
24 been '63. He was a personal representative of Castro to the
25 games, first in Brazil, and I don't think he had a specific

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 post in '63, as I recall. He had been Deputy Minister of
2 Interior. He had been a military attache in Spain. I don't think
3 he had a specific post at that time.

4 Excuse me, if I may add just one more point. Before that he
5 had been President of the Student Federation at the University
6 of Havana. He may still have been in that post, or about the
7 time that he was getting out of it, and this is, I think, where
8 really the trouble between this particular fellow and the Castro
9 brothers more or less came to ahead.

10 Mr. Johnston. On the 19th of September, Jim Wave sent a
11 message to headquarters basically warning, giving a warning,
12 making the statement that there was an anti-Communist group in
13 Cuba, and the name AMLASH is part of that group, and it concluded
14 by saying that Fidel is allegedly aware of both the anti-Communist
15 group and a Communist group, and that he acts as a moderator
16 between them in order to maintain cohesion in the government of
17 Cuba.

18 Do you recall receiving that information?

19 AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall specifically receiving
20 that information, but I do recall that at that time Fidel
21 Castro himself was talking about was concerned about a
22 Communist takeover of the revolution, and he did meet with the
23 subject and some other friends of his in order to prevent this.

24 Mr. Johnston. When was this?

25 AMLASH Case Officer. This was in the early '60s sometime.

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 Senator Schweiker. What year were you in?

2 Mr. Johnston. '63.

3 AMLASH Case Officer. This was before '63. This must have
4 been in '62.

5 Mr. Wallach. This is before his trip to the Soviet
6 Union?

7 Mr. Johnston. Before Castro's trip?

8 Mr. Wallach. Right.

9 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

10 MR. Johnston. The question being put is after your
11 meeting in Brazil with AMLASH, Jim Wave cabled headquarters that
12 AMLASH was part of a group of anti-Communist Cuban government
13 leaders and that Castro was aware of that fact.

14 AMLASH Case Officer. My answer to you is that he certainly
15 was because he had been talking with these people, including
16 AMLASH, a year before. Yes.

17 Senator Schweiker. Castro was aware that he was anti-
18 Communist?

19 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, that he was one of the anti-
20 Communist group.

21 Senator Schweiker. Why would he be so trusted and be the
22 special representative at that point in time if he was known
23 as anti-Communist?

24 AMLASH Case Officer. Because of the relationship with
25 Castro. Castro himself had not declared his Communist, more or

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 less intentions, as of that time.

2 Senator Schweiker. Wait, this was after the Cuban missile
3 crisis. This was '63, and the Cuban missile crisis was '62.

4 I'm confused here.

5 AMLASH Case Officer. Let's go back to the dates here.

6 Senator Schweiker. The Jim Wave date is September 1963,
7 and he knows at this point, allegedly now, that this AMLASH
8 was a member of an anti-Communist group. I have trouble
9 reconciling that with not pinpointing AMLASH and his possible
10 subversive agent. I think that is what Jim is getting to.

11 AMLASH Case Officer. Again, my answer is I don't know
12 specifically why or what the origin of the '63 J. M. Wave
13 cable was.

14 My answer again to the question is that Castro, from his
15 previous knowledge, going back to '62, did know and had consulted
16 with this group of people of which AMLASH was one, who were the
17 group of Anti-Communist officers in the revolution.

18 Mr. Johnston. So

19 AMLASH Case Officer. I don't know why in '63 this report
20 would have come out, but it would confirm Castro's knowledge
21 of this group, yes.

22 Mr. Johnston. Let me move on into October. There was a
23 meeting with AMLASH.

24 Senator Schweiker. How long did he tolerate anti-Communist
25 officers in high positions in his government? I've got to

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 believe there's some cutoff here. I realize the uniqueness and
2 broadness of his support earlier, but it would just seem to me
3 that at some point he really had to weed out, nottnecessarily
4 weed out or be suspect of anti-Communist officers who had too
5 high decision making in his government, would he not, or am I
6 missing something?

7 AMLASH Case Officer. No, not really, because out of this
8 group that was mentioned, and with whom he himself discussed
9 the need in the early '60s to keep, say, the Communists out,
10 some of those officers are still in his goverment today.

11 Now, they may have changed, or Castro may have changed, but
12 he didn't purge all this group of officers. Maybe he won them
13 over, and if they are still there, evidently he has some
14 confidence in them.

15 Mr. Johnston. According to the file, there was a meeting on
16 October 5th, apparently, in Paris, and I'm not sure that you were
17 the case officer at that meeting, and the cable from Paris
18 sets the tone of that meeting as AMLASH apparently was trying
19 to get things off his chest in talking to you.

20 Were you the case officer at that meeting?

21 AMLASH Case Officer. I was the case officer during that
22 period of time.

23 Go into a little of the detail because we did talk about
24 these problems.

25 Mr. Johnston. There appeared from the file two meetings

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 in early October 1963, the first meeting on or about October
2 5th that AMLASH comes in and says I want to get things off my
3 chest, and seems to express great dissatisfaction with the
4 CIA's position.

5 Then there's a second meeting on October 13th or so where
6 he specifically asks to meet with Robert Kennedy, and you
7 previously testified about that second meeting.

8 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

9 Mr. Johnston. Now, the file indicates there was an
10 earlier meeting on October 5th, and AMLASH was complaining
11 apparently about the low level espionage matters that had been
12 discussed in Brazil, and implying that he had a more valuable
13 role to play, and the file says the case officer provided the
14 necessary assurances that his feelings were not in fact
15 true, and that his case was receiving the consideration at
16 the highest levels.

17 With this problem which had undoubtedly been bothering
18 AMLASH off his chest, a much more relaxed AMLASH departed,
19 stating his desire to return to Cuba to undertake the big
20 job.

21 Do you recall that meeting?

22 AMLASH Case Officer. I think you are getting those two
23 meetings mixed up. In other words, the later one, yes. I
24 was there and talking to him in the second meeting. In the
25 first meeting I don't recall precisely, but there could have

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 been a meeting with a contact in Paris, in other words, not a
2 case officer, but the contact we had in Paris. I don't remember
3 who that was, one of the officers there.

4 Mr. Johnston. In addition to you he was in contact with
5 AMLASH Case Officer. Only for purposes of contact. I mean,
6 only to make contact with me, not to carry on the case. But
7 he knew that the other officer was a friend of mine, and he
8 was in touch with him, and when he came to Paris he would get
9 in touch with him. So I would be notified.

10 Mr. Johnston. I think you have used his name in the
11 prior transcript, Fred Stent, the case officer?

12 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, because he was the one who
13 furnished the quarters where we had the meetings.

14 Mr. Johnston. In furnishing the quarters, did you have a
15 taping system going as to the discussions that would take place?

16 AMLASH Case Officer. No, I don't believe we taped any of
17 those meetings?

18 Mr. Johnston. Is it procedure to tape meetings with
19 Agents?

20 AMLASH Case Officer. Sometimes. It is not a standard
21 procedure. Sometimes it is not physically possible.

22 Mr. Johnston. Let me go back into this meeting of October
23 5th, which you don't recall that you were at this meeting, is
24 that correct?

25 AMLASH Case Officer. There probably could have been the

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 meeting when he first arrived in Paris, and the meeting that he
2 had I don't recall specifically.

3 I do recall, if I may, I do recall that he said he was
4 unhappy because of the requirements, the intelligence require-
5 ments that we had levied on him in Brazil, and it is true that
6 his position was at that time, even in Brazil, and later in
7 Paris, that he was not disposed to cooperate just to furnish
8 intelligence. In other words, he felt that he wanted to do
9 something about the removal of Castro but was not just prepared
10 to keep us advised as to what was going on. He recognized that
11 this was certainly part of a needed operation, but he did not
12 consider himself just as a provider of information.

13 Mr. Johnston. Let me go off the record for a minute
14 because I want to use a code name.

15 (Discussion off the record.)

16 Mr. Johnston. Having mentioned the code name that is
17 used in this cable, you now recall you were at the 5 October
18 meeting?

19 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

20 Mr. Johnston. And the cable, you can look at it, indicates
21 that AMLASH was in a confessional mood.

22 My question to you is, after recalling that meeting, was
23 it basically one where he was expressing his concern about
24 the CIA role for him?

25 Mr. Johnston. He was expressing his concern for what?

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Johnston. The CIA's plans for using him.

2 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes. He was concerned as to how and
3 in what way he was to cooperate with CIA. He was also and
4 we must underline this, right from the beginning, dubious
5 as to our resolve to really follow through on initiating a
6 coup against Castro.

7 Mr. Johnston. Is the cable correct in stating that he was
8 assured that his case was receiving consideration at the
9 highest levels?

10 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

11 Mr. Johnston. Was the word \"highest level\" used, or was
12 a name used?

13 AMLASH Case Officer. Highest levels, but at that stage
14 of the game he knew he was talking to CIA, so highest levels
15 in CIA is what was meant at that particular time.

16 Mr. Johnston. That's the word you used?

17 You didn't say Director McCone?

18 AMLASH Case Officer. I did not use names, no.

19 Mr. Johnston. On October 5th, you reassured him that his
20 consideration, that his case was receiving consideration at
21 least at the highest levels of CIA, and the cable reflects
22 that when he left that meeting he seemed much more relaxed about
23 the case.

24 Is that an accurate portrayal of the meeting?

25 AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Johnston. As I mentioned, there was another meeting
2 on or about October 13th, where, as I understand it, AMLASH
3 made his demand or his request to meet with Robert Kennedy, and
4 he made that request to meet with Kennedy by name.

5 Is that correct?

6 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, he did.

7 Well, he said somebody such as, somebody high in the
8 administration, again, to receive the assurances that we were
9 prepared to that we were serious about developing and
10 organizing a coup.

11 Mr. Johnston. After that meeting, you were recalled to
12 Langley for discussions, is that correct?

13 AMLASH Case Officer. I was traveling back and forth
14 between Paris and Langley, yes. I don't recall if I was
15 recalled at that particular time, but I would go there I
16 was TDY.

17 Mr. Johnston. I want to set the stage. There is a
18 message from the Director, 75683, to London, directing you to
19 return to headquarters for discussion of all facets of the
20 case.

21 This is after you reported that AMLASH wants to meet
22 with someone like Robert Kennedy.

23 Do you recall that flow of events?

24 AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

25 Mr. Johnston. What discussions did you have at Langley,

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 and I don't want to go through your previous testimony again,
2 but basically are we correct in understanding that out of the
3 discussions at Langley came a decision to go to Paris with
4 Mr. Fitzgerald representing himself as a personal representative
5 of Robert Kennedy?

6 AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

7 Mr. Johnston. Then you met on October 29, according to
8 the file, with AMLASH, Mr. Fitzgerald, in Paris.

9 Is that correct?

10 AMLASH Case Officer. Excuse me. Can I go off the
11 record?

12 (Discussion off the record.)

13 Mr. Wallach. I think you stated that AMLASH said that he
14 would like to meet with one of the U.S. leaders such as
15 Robert Kennedy?

16 AMLASH Case Officer. A high representative in the U.S.
17 Government.

18 Mr. Wallach. Did he mention any other names that you
19 recall?

20 AMLASH Case Officer. No, not that I recall.

21 Mr. Wallach. Just Robert Kennedy?

22 AMLASH Case Officer. Such as Robert Kennedy.

23 Mr. Wallach. Did AMLASH, to the best of your knowledge,
24 from what he told you, know about any prior assassination
25 attempts that had been run by the U.S.?

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 AMLASH Case Officer. No.

2 Mr. Wallach. Did he have any reason to believe that Robert
3 Kennedy had been involved with any of the sabotage operations
4 as contrasted with any assassination attempts?

5 AMLASH Case Officer. If he knew, he never mentioned it to
6 me. We never discussed that.

7 Mr. Wallach. In other words, you didn't say to him,
8 how did you know that Robert Kennedy or why did you pick
9 Robert Kennedy.

10 AMLASH Case Officer. No, not at all. I mean, it's a
11 perfectly, I think, logical name to have been mentioned at
12 that time, because by him, since he was the President's brother
13 and since he was the Attorney General, he wanted somebody high
14 in the Government; at one time he had mentioned the President,
15 you know, I want to talk to the President.

16 Mr. Wallach. It seems strange to me he didn't pick the
17 Secretary of State or someone like that.

18 AMLASH Case Officer. No.

19 Mr. Wallach. What I'm trying to get at

20 AMLASII Case Officer. He wanted somebody directly to the
21 President. In other words, he wanted the assurances
22 from the highest authority, again, from the President of
23 the United States.

24 Mr. Wallach. What I'm trying to get at is we, from our
25 examination of the alleged assassination attempts, have also

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 gone into the sabotage attempts, MONGOOSE, etc, and found out
2 that Bobby Kennedy did play a role in the sabotage attempts.

3 What I'm trying to get from you is your understanding of
4 whether or not AMLASH, from his Cuban side, knew that the
5 Kennedy's had played that role, and would necessarily say I want
6 to talk to Robert Kennedy for that reason.

7 AMLASH Case Officer. No. He never mentioned it, not at
8 all in any way.

9 Mr. Johnston. Let me finally go to the October 29th meeting,
10 and before we went on the record this morning, you were
11 explaining to us how you characterized the AMLASH operation.
12 Would you repeat in summary form what you told us before
13 we went on the record?

14 AMLASH Case Officer. The operation was never conceived,
15 certainly, carried out during the period I was associated with
16 it, but was never conceived as an assassination plot. It was
17 conceived as a coup in order to organize a military group
18 within Cuba to overthrow Castro.

19 Mr. Johnston. Did you have the understanding that if
20 necessary AMLASH was proposing to assassinate the Castro
21 brothers?

22 AMLASH Case Officer. Assassination was not a subject of
23 discussion that came up at every meeting or contact that we
24 had with AMLASH. It was so stated by him that he felt that
25 the only way to initiate a coup in Cuba was to direct the

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 first blow at the leadership.

2 Since we were not willing to discuss specifically eliminating
3 Castro, this was never discussed in terms of the operation.
4 We certainly had no doubt that in his mind this was the only
5 way to go about it.

6 Mr. Johnston. And you dealt with him on that basis?

7 AMLASH Case Officer. Trying to temporize this, and if
8 possible we were not looking for a bloody coup at that time,
9 planning a bloody coup inside Cuba, but we were trying to
10 certainly get him to think in terms of much more than just the
11 elimination of the leadership.

12 Mr. Johnston. And to broaden it.

13 AMLASH Case Officer. To broaden it into a coup. Our
14 interest was the coup, not the specifics of how he got it
15 started.

16 Mr. Johnston. You were concerned about whether his
17 plans were realistic, weren't you?

18 AMLASH Case Officer. Very definitely, yes.

19 Senator Schweiker. Did you personally evaluate AMLASH
20 as fully capable of leading a coup and being able to implement
21 it and carry it out if support were given?

22 How did you evaluate AMLASH?

23 As I understand from the dialogue here, and also from
24 reading a summary of these, at first the operations talk was
25 fairly low level sabotage, which he out of hand rejected, and

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

1 he pictured himself as a leader of a top level effort on the
2 condition that it had assurances of government support and top
3 level support here.

4 Now, I guess my question to you is, how, as case officer,
5 did you evaluate his capability? Did you evaluate him as
6 someone who could lead a coup and who would, that our government
7 could put trust in, faith in in terms of his ability to carry it
8 out or not?

9 AMLASH Case Officer. At that time we did not evaluate
10 him as the

CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE
CAPABILITIES IN LATIN
AMERICA

THE PROBLEM
To describe and evaluate Castro's capabilities, with Soviet help,
for carrying out subversion and sabotage in Latin America after
satisfaction of all US conditions relative to the withdrawal of
strategic weapons systems from Cuba and a consequent US com-
mitment not to invade.

NOTE: In this estimate we have considered Castro's raw capabilities,
taking note of, but not working out in detail, US and Latin
American capabilities for counteraction.

SUMMARY
A. The dangerously unstable situation that prevails through-
out much of Latin America is the product of fundamental in-
equities and historic circumstances; it is not the creation of
Castro and the Soviets. Castro's efforts, with Soviet help, to
exploit this situation by means of subversion and sabotage have
not produced significant results. Propaganda exploitation of
Castro and Cuba as symbols of revolution has probably beer more
effective to date than other subversive activities. Castres in-
fluence in Latin America had waned by the time of the missile
base crisis and was further reduced by the revelation that he
had accepted Soviet strategic missile bases on Cuban soil and
by the manner of the Soviet decision to withdraw them.

B. Implementation of an agreement between the US and the
USSR whereby the strategic weapons systems would be with-
drawn and the US committed not to intervene in Cuba with force
will leave Castro with a new immunity and a greater freedom

SECRET 1
NW 88608 Docld:32423995 Page 5

C SECRET
for subversive actions throughout Latin America. The extent
to which this potential is realized will depend upon the situation
in Cuba, Soviet policy toward Cuba, and the policies and perform-
ance of the other Latin American governments and of the US with
respect to the Castro threat. There are many targets in the
hemisphere vulnerable to Castro-Communist subversion and sab
otage, and the Soviets are likely to assist Castro in reaching them
by contributing both to his security at home and to his capability
for action overseas. As in the period before the missile base
crisis, the effect of Castro's subversive activities will depend not
only upon his capabilities but upon the attractiveness of the
Cuban example and the willingness of the American governments
to take determined counteraction. This willingness will probably
be weakened by fulfillment of the US commitment not to invade
Cuba.

C. We have examined how Castro's subversive potential would
be affected by alternative courses of Soviet policy regarding Cuba:
(1) virtual withdrawal of support; (2) continuation of economic
and military support ranging from present up to substantially
increased levels. We believe that course (1) would considerably
reduce Castro's subversive potential, and that the Soviets are
unlikely to elect it. We conclude that Soviet course (2) would
maintain Castro's potential for subversive action at least at pres
ent levels or actually raise it to the point where he could under-
take amphibious and/or airborne subversive operations against
close-in targets.

NW 88608 Docld:32423995 Page 6

THE ESTIMATE

1. CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE MISSILE BASE CRISIS ¹
Aims
1. From the time of his accession to power Fidel Castro has sought to
gain acceptance of the Cuban revolution as a model for others and of
himself as the leader of revolutionary forces throughout Latin America.
He has constantly sought to foment revolutions in other Latin American
States. Moreover, Castro has generally had the support of the Sino-
Soviet Bloc in the pursuit of these aims.

Means
2. Castro began his career of sponsorship for revolutions in Latin
America in 1959 with landings of small rebel forces in Nicaragua, Pan-
ama, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. None of these were successful
and he turned to other means.

3. From the beginning, propaganda has been one of the principal in-
struments on which Castro has relied. In addition to the main trans-
missions of Radio Havana for external listeners, which have had a great
deal of revolutionary content, he has beamed special programs devised
to stimulate revolutionary action to each of half a dozen selected
countries. A major effort has been made through Prensa Latina, the
Cuban news service, to disseminate Castro-Communist propaganda.
Printed propaganda has also been sent from Cuba into most other
Latin American States, and Cuban diplomatic missions and personnel
have actively disseminated it. Students returning from indoctrination
in Cuba have helped establish Cuban Institutes for Friendship among
Peoples which have functioned as propaganda outlets.

4. Thousands of Latin Americans have been brought to Cuba; about
1,200 foreign trainees are believed to be there now. Many hundreds
have been trained in revolutionary techniques and guerrilla warfare.
Cuba has been made a main transit point for travel between Latin
America and the Bloc.

5. Financial support has been provided by Cuba to revolutionary
groups in a number of countries, although the cases on which we have
reports involved relatively small sums of money. Arms shipments have

See Annex A.
Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic.

SECRET 3
NW 88608 Docld:32423995 Page 7

C
C SECRET
also been reported, but the evidence is unclear as to quantities shipped
and the extent of Cuba's role in these transactions. We believe that
there is an extensive agent net in Latin America directed from Havana.

6. Castro has associated himself with revolutionary activist groups
throughout Latin America. In most cases these have been Communist,
but where the regular Communist Party favored a legal or parliamen-
tary line he has not hesitated to support dissident Communist groups,
e.g., in Brazil, and non-Communist revolutionaries, e.g., in Guatemala
and El Salvador. In some cases he has sponsored new revolutionary
organizations, e.g., in Panama, Colombia, and Peru. In Chile he has
endorsed a popular front coalition made up of Communist and moderate
leftists.

Evaluation
7. Instances of financial and material support sent by Cuba to revolu-
tionaries in other countries which have come to our attention are
probably only a part of the total effort. Even so, the effort seems to
have been relatively small and ineffective. Yet along with the political
and psychological stimulus which Castro's influence has provided, Cuban
subversive activities have perceptibly strengthened activist revolutionary
groups. Dangerous situations subject to exploitation by Castro and
the Communists exist in a number of Latin American countries-
notably Venezuela, Brazil, British Guiana, the Dominican Republic, and
Bolivia. These dangers arise from political and social tensions which
existed long before Castro came to power. They might lie dormant
for some time; but with Castro as a potential detonator, they are more
likely to blow up. The detonative compound will exist as long as Cas-
troism survives, whatever may happen to Castro personally.

8. The most dangerous aspect of Castroism has been its broad appeal
as a symbol of revolutionary change and nationalist assertiveness in
Latin America. Propaganda from Cuba has taken advantage of this
fact and has almost certainly been a more important influence in the
Latin American situation than Castro's other subversive activities.
During 1960 and 1961 Castroism became a force to be reckoned with
politically in a number of Latin American countries. Certain govern-
ments felt obliged to move in the direction of neutralist and leftist posi-
tions. This influence waned, however, after Castro identified himself
with the Bloc in late 1961. Nevertheless, the appeal to Castro's move-
ment continued to be a source of major concern to almost all govern-
ments and seriously restricted their willingness to associate themselves,
at least publicly, with the US.

II. CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE POTENTIAL IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN
AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH THE SOVIETS WOULD WITHDRAW
THEIR STRATEGIC MISSILES AND THE US GIVE ASSURANCES THAT
IT WOULD NOT INVADE CUBA

9. Castro's subversive capabilities and his disposition to use them-
will be enhanced by the sense of security provided by such sophisticated
weapons as are retained in Cuba after the withdrawal of Soviet strategic
missiles. The IL-28 bombers, if retained, and other modern equipment
noted in Annex B, would be important in this regard. A US commit-
ment not to invade Cuba will further strengthen his sense of immunity
from reprisal and almost certainly encourage him to intensify subver-
sive activities in other Latin American countries.

Response of Castro Supporters to Missile Base Crisis
10. Castro's supporters throughout Latin America, with few though
important exceptions (e.g., sabotage of oil facilities in Venezuela), failed
to respond to the missile base crisis with effective acts of sabotage or
with impressive public demonstrations. Two important limiting factors
should be taken into account in judging this response, however. US
action to alert Latin American governments led them to make extensive
advance preparation, including deployment of security forces and the
roundup of suspects, a condition of readiness which is unlikely to be
maintained indefinitely. There also may have been some uncertainty
among the activist followers of Castro whether they should make their
big effort in response to the announcement of the US blockade, or wait
for the anticipated US invasion. Moscow's apparent failure to provide
guidance may have contributed to the confusion. It is our judgment,
however, that the response to Castro's appeal for attacks on the US-
and its friends indicates that his power to command revolutionary
action, at least in the circumstances of the missile base crisis, is limited.

Support Which Castro Can Expect in the Future
11. The range of Castro's support has been, we believe, considerably
narrowed by events since Castro declared himself a Communist. Rev-
elation of the fact that he had allowed the Soviets to establish offensive
bases under exclusive Soviet control has alienated many non-Communist
nationalists, genuine neutralists, and even revolutionaries seeking social
and economic betterment. San Tiago Dantas, formerly Foreign Min-
ister under President Goulart and an author of Brazil's nonalignment
policy, and leading Mexican officials have publicly expressed their
disenchantment.

12. The activist revolutionaries are probably the only important force
on which Castro can now count, but even their support has apparently
been rendered less effective by differences on the question of Soviet rela-
tions with Castro and with Latin American Communist parties.

Castro's Resources for Continued Subversive Activity
13. Arms. (See Annex B.) Castro has substantial stocks of arms.
In addition to Soviet Bloc materiel there are stores of arms inherited
from the Batista regime not being used by Castro forces and available
for distribution outside Cuba. In the past he has apparently been ham-
pered in his efforts to use arms for subversive purposes by problems
of transport and delivery. He has at his disposal, however, 11 IL-14
transports belonging to Cubana airlines which could be used to deliver
arms under certain circumstances. The IL-28's now in Cuba are in-
appropriate for subversive purposes. However, they could be used for
air drops. Cuba has many small craft suitable for infiltration of men
and arms. The 6 Khronshtadt subchasers, 16 P-6 motor torpedo boats,
and 12 Komar missile boats obtained from the Bloc could also bé used
for arms deliveries. If the projected trawler base is built up, trawlers-
both Cuban and Soviet could be used for arms deliveries. If Soviet
submarines call at the trawler base or at other Cuban ports, they, too,
could be used in support of subversive activities. We see no evidence
that Cuba has or is developing a sophisticated amphibious warfare
capability, and all the means of delivery of arms by sea noted above
would be vulnerable to precautionary measures by Latin American mil-
itary and naval forces.

14. Propaganda apparatus. Castro's propaganda machine remains
intact. For the time being, however, his diplomatic missions are likely
to find it harder to disseminate propaganda than in the past, both be-
cause of new precautions by local governments and because of a reduc-
tion in the numbers of cooperative volunteers outside the organized
Communist groups.

15. Money and equipment. Despite differences between Castro and
the USSR concerning dismantling of the missile bases, we believe that the
Soviets will continue to supply Castro with money, supplies, and equip-
ment for subversive activity. The Soviets have certainly supplied Castro
with sophisticated instruments of intelligence collection, sabotage, and
clandestine communications.

16. Organization. The organization of Castro's subversive assets
throughout Latin America was shown by the recent crisis to be loose
and otherwise faulty. We estimate that Castro will make a strong
effort to strengthen and improve it, and that he will continue to receive
support in this effort from the Soviet apparatus, both in Cuba itself,
where the Soviet Ambassador is a veteran officer of the KGB, and in
other important centers of Soviet activity such as Mexico City and
Montevideo.

Other Factors on Which Castro's Subversive Capability Will Depend
17. If the US and USSR reach and implement the agreement stated
in the problem Castro will gain an immunity which he lacked before the
missile base crisis. He will, furthermore, still have most of the arms
and equipment which were delivered in the post-July buildup, as well
as enhanced capabilities provided by accelerated training. Presumably
his enemies will have about the same, or less, freedom to engage in
propaganda, sabotage, support for resistance activities, and other actions
designed to overthrow Castro than they had before the crisis-almost
certainly not more. Unless Castro is gravely endangered by internal
political and economic problems, there is no reason to believe that anti-
Castro activities are any more likely to jeopardize his position than they
did before the crisis.

18. Situation in Cuba. Castro's ability to engage in subversive activ-
ities will be influenced significantly by the strength and stability of his
position at home. Heightened political and economic difficulties in
Cuba would restrict Castro's subversive effort, while the more secure
he is at home, the more freedom and strength he is likely to have for
subverting other governments and re-establishing his prestige and in-
fluence. Castro's position in Cuba will depend in part on his own
policies, but is likely to depend even more upon those of the Soviets.

19. Alternative Soviet policies. There are several courses of action
with respect to Cuba which the Soviets are likely to consider. Some
leaders may argue that the whole policy of economic and military
support for Castro should be abandoned along with the plan for the
deployment of strategic missiles in Cuba. We believe, however, that
the Soviet stake in Cuba as an ally and as a Soviet center in Latin
America is still too high to abandon. The stake in Castro as a person,
however, is questionable. If the Soviets did make a decision to with-
draw support either from Castro or from Cuba, we believe that Cuban
capability for subversion in Latin America would be greatly reduced, at
least for a time. This capability would be reduced more in the case of
the Soviets' withdrawing support from Cuba than in the case of their
abandonment of Castro alone.

20. An alternative course would be for the Soviets to continue to
extend economic and military assistance. Such assistance could range
all the way from the amounts necessary to maintain Cuba in its present
condition, including support of the expanded military establishment,
to substantial increases. Such a policy would probably reduce con-
siderably Castro's internal problems and thus give him additional free-
dom to engage in external subversion and sabotage. Additions to Cas-
tro's stocks of small arms would not in themselves change his capa-
bility for subversive activity, as he already has supplies of surplus arms.
However, if the Soviets were to provide substantial additional air and

SECRET 7
NW 88608 Docld:32423995 Page 11

C SECRET
sealift capability, the Cubans would be able to mount large-scale
subversive interventions in neighboring countries. Furthermore, what-
ever degree of success is achieved in improving Cuba's position and in
expanding its physical resources, Cuba's net capability for subversion
and sabotage will in the last analysis largely be determined by the..
overall situation in Latin America.

21. We do not believe that Castro or the Soviets can yet foresee what
the effects of the recent crisis will be over the long term on their rela-
tionship. The crisis has probably created difficulties of a political and
psychological nature that neither of them can readily solve, however
determined they may be to do so. Castro may have been moved by the
treatment he has received at the hands of the Soviets to consider
modifying his relationship with them and seeking to improve his rela-
tions with the OAS and possibly even the US. We believe, however,
that he is unlikely to find feasible ways of reducing his dependence
upon the USSR. The Soviets certainly must consider that they have
effective means of exercising control over Castro. Furthermore, his re-
peated assertions of continued loyalty to Marxism-Leninism make it
unlikely that he is seriously contemplating a restoration of relations
with the OAS, or that he could succeed if he tried.

22. Policy of other American nations. Castro's subversive capabilities
will be greatly influenced by the policies and actions of other Latin
American nations, as by those of the US. We believe that the high
state of security alert that has prevailed since 22 October and the show
of unity that marked the recent crisis are unlikely to last. There is
sure to be a revival of nationalist sentiments. On balance, however,
we believe that the prospects for countersubversive action by Latin
American States, on their own and in conjunction with the US, are im-
proved. Many responsible Latin Americans will have interpreted recent
events to mean that firm and united action can be effective against
the Soviet threat from Cuba. However, Latin American governments
will probably be less willing to take coordinated action against Com-
munist inroads if the US commits itself not to invade Cuba.

Likely Future Targets for Cuban Sabotage
23. The extent of Castro's capabilities for sabotage and other clan-
destine activity in Latin America will depend upon the complicated
factors noted above. Whatever his capabilities are, he will not be at
a loss for targets against which to use them. Some of the more obvious
targets are:

a. US missions and personnel. US missions and personnel all over
Latin America were designated as targets for attack in the various
calls for action which went out during the recent crisis. Action against

8 SECRET
NW 88608 Docld:32423995 Page 12

C
C SECRET
such targets has a primarily political and propaganda value to Castro
in that it tends to show public opposition to US policy. It is also rela-
tively easy for Castro to promote attacks against official US installations
in a crisis situation and to get help from all the various elements which
are opposed to American influence in the area. Future attacks may
be anticipated in situations in which Castro feels that the public resent-
ment of US policy exists or can be stirred up.

b. Physical targets vulnerable to a limited sabotage effort. Prime
targets for sabotage will be mining, industrial, and business installa-
tions in which there is a large proportion of US capital, which are other-
wise associated with the US, or which are so important to the local
economy that damage to them would create difficulties for govern-
ments which are anti-Castro and cooperating with the US. Oil facilities
in Venezuela, including the oil and water pipelines to the refineries on
the Paraguana Peninsula, and similar facilities are likely to be chosen
as targets for Cuban sabotage. Installations for the handling of Vene-
zuelan iron ore are also likely objectives. US installations in Panama
might be attacked.

c. Port and communications facilities are generally vulnerable to
sabotage and are appealing targets to Cubans and other Latin American
Communists particularly in countries which are cooperating with the
US and whose communications media are taking an anti-Castro line.
Telephone, telegraph, radio and television facilities, and most public
utilities, particularly electric power and transformer stations, are poten-
tial targets. Selection of targets for sabotage will depend on the im-
portance of particular facilities but even more on the varying access of
Castroites and Communists to them.

d. Political targets susceptible to exploitation. Political instability
throughout Latin America, in almost every case characterized by pres-
sures from below upon relatively conservative and generally anti-
Communist governments, provide Castro with opportunities for sub-
versive political activity. Particularly unstable situations include the
following:
(1) Venezuela, where Communist-inspired disorders have been kept
in check by the government, but where continued Communist
and leftist violence may lead the military to take control.
In a country such as Venezuela, where the stability of an anti-
Castro and anti-Communist government depends heavily upon
one man, assassination is another danger.
(2) Nicaragua, where Communist-led groups, in anticipation of
coming elections, may seek to incite or exploit violence against
the Somoza regime.
(3) Guatemala, where President Ydigoras' position is weak and
uncertain.

(4) The Dominican Republic, where the problems of political recon-
struction after a generation of dictatorship have proved almost
more than the caretaker government can handle, and where
some political groupings amenable to Castro's influence are
seeking to gain a footing.
(5) Bolivia, where the struggle for dominance within the ruling
MNR Party between the moderates and those on the far left
is ready-made for exploitation by Castro.
(6) Brazil, where Communists have penetrated the government
and military to some limited extent, the tide of nationalist and
anti-US feeling is strong, and depressed socio-economic condi-
tions and inefficient government administration provide Castro
many opportunities, especially in the northeast.

PROPAGANDA

General: Since 1 January 1959, the Castro/Communist Regine has
placed great emphasis on ito propaganda efforts throughout Latin America,
as reflected in the quantities of personel and obvious amounts of
funds devoted to this enterprise. One of the first efforts was to
establish PRENSA LATINA, a Cuben news agency with exchange agreements
with TASS and the HEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, as the principal Castro/Communist
overt cutlet. Shipments of printed pamphlets, books, mgazines ond
leaflets have been discovered in Cuban diplomatic pouches in Mexico,
Panama, Chile and Argentins. The baggage of most travellers departing
Cuba contains printed propagenda. Cubon government personalities such
as Dr. Armando Hert, Minister of Education, are known to have transported.
quantities of this printed material. Personal representation plays a
grest part in the Castro/Communist propaganda program. Trevellera to
Cuba for economic, political and cultural meetings are indoctrinated and
are provided material for further distribution upon return to their home
countries. Student, labor, youth, wonen, and professional organizations
Derve as a mediun for propaganda dissemination. Diplomatic and economic
representatives have cultivated local communists, influential leftists,
and anti-government dissidents through personal contact. Radio plays
an extremely important part in the Castro/Comunist propaganda effort
within Cuba and externally.

The following description of the Cuban Government's measures this
past year to organize propaganda and press control is based upon the
25 September report of an official German service supplemented by August
1962 information from a fairly reliable independent source.

In early 1962 the ORI decided to establish a Comite de Orientacion
Revolucionaria (COR) to be responsible for all propaganda activities
of the Cuban Government and for censorship of the press. Cesar Escalante,
en old-time Comunist, a member of the ONI National Directorate and brother
of Anibal Escalante who was later \"purged\" by Castro, was appointed head
of the COR and thus given control over the entire Cuban press, radio, and
television. By August, Cesar Escalante was reported to have a personal.
staff of 15 workers, most of whom were Comunist Party members, end to
be holding weekly briefing sessions with editors of the four large Havana
newspapers, entrusting censorship to these editors.

In late June 1962, the ORI set up a committee to be in charge of
coordination of Cuban propaganda throughout Latin America. This committee
was subordinate to the COR, and consisted of representatives from the
Ministry of Foreign Relations, the Prensa Latina news agency and the COR.
The director of Prensa Latina was the news agency's representative on this
committee. The representative of the COR, however, along with the repre-
sentative of the Foreign Ministry, believed to be Ramon Penate y Molina,
were said to have actually determined the policy of Prensa Latina.

The reorganization of Prensa Latina is described as Escalente's
most important accomplishment. Since mid-July 1962 the news agency
has been increasingly employed as an instrument of the Cuban Foreign
Ministry and is serving as its propaganda medium in these countries with

NW 88608 Docld:32423995 Page 19 SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM

which Cuba no longer maintains diplomatic relations. Cesar Escalante
now controls Prensa Latina's activities both in Cuba and abroad.
He is assisted by Ramon Calcines Gordillo, also a veteran Communist and
member of the ORT National Directorate, who acts as liaison official
with the Communist parties of Latin America. Calcines has been reported
as being also a director of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples
(ICAP) with which Prensa Latina maintains close relations.

The staff of the Prensa Latina center in Havana is to be enlarged
from 150 employees to elmost 1,000 by January 1963. The center also
employs about 250 salaried personnel in Latin America in addition to
numerous free-lance correspondents. The Latin American section of the
Prensa Latina center enjoys a favored position with special privileges
given to \"sub-agencies\" working in countries which have broken diplomatic
relations with Cuba. The sub-agencies in several Latin American capitals
are to be enlarged as operational centers for certain areas for example,
Bogota will be a coordinating center for Colombia, Venezuela, Panama,
Costa Rica, and Nicaragua, and Mexico City for Mexico, Honduras, El
Salvador, and Guatemala.

The 100-Kilowatt VHF transmitter of Radio Havana is of special
Importance for increasing Cuban propaganda activities in Latin America;
et the end of propaganda broadcasts the station reportedly also transmits
specific directives to Cuban agents abroad. The manager of the radio
station is Baldomoro Alvarez Rios, president of the Cuban-Chinese Friend-
ship Committee, who maintains close contact with Shen Chien, Communist
Chinese embassador to Cube. Communist China is said to have considerable
influence on Cuba propaganda activities.

PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE ADVISORY BOARD
April 5, 1965
TOP SECRET
MEMORANDUM FOR FILE
SUBJECT: Board Meeting, October 1-2, 1964

October 1, 1964
The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board
convened at 9:00 AM on October 1, 1964 at the Board's
offices in the Executive Office Building. Present were
Chairman Clifford; Board members Langer, Pace, Gray, Land
and Baker (Mr. Murphy was in Brazil); and Messrs. Coyne
and Ash.
In opening the meeting the Chairman pointed out that
ample time had been allotted during this two-day meeting fore
Board members to discuss agenda items of special interest.
He then turned to some matters which he wished to bring to
the Board's attention before proceeding with the regular
agenda.
Chairman Clifford informed Board members that since the
last Board meeting he had met with the President a number o
times for discussions of various subjects, and on these
occasions had taken the opportunity to progressively acquaint
the President with the work of the Board. Mr. Clifford pointed
out to the Board that, unlike President Kennedy who had re-
constituted the Board in 1961 and was thoroughly familiar with
its functioning, President Johnson has not been as intimately
associated with the Board primarily for the reason that no
intelligence-related incidents have thus far arisen in President
Johnson's term to evidence his special need for the Board's
assistance. However, during the past few months the President
is beginning to get a better idea of the Board's accomplishments
as a result of Mr. Clifford's comments from time to time.
Chairman Clifford observed that otherwise it was unlikely that
the President would learn much about the work done by the Board,
and certainly not from the intelligence community itself and
probably not from Mr. McGeorge Bundy whose many duties of a
non-intelligence nature are most demanding

With a view to keeping the Board fully informed of the
President's indicated reactions to Board's work, Mr. Clifford
said that for the time being the President prefers a quiet,
unostentatious operation of the Board. It is the President's
desire to try to avoid any explosions in the intelligence field,
and any resignations in heat by any members of the intelligence
community. After coming into office under most difficult
circumstances, the President has found people are eager to help,
and he relies heavily on Secretaries Rusk and McNamara and on
others such as the members of this Board.

Concerning contacts with the Director of Central Intelligence,
Mr. Clifford said that he has talked with him from time to time.
Recently, Mr. McCone had called to say that he was going to be
out of the country on a mission, and he asked that General Carter
of CIA be furnished the usual list of topics which Board members
wished the DCI to cover during this meeting of the Board.

At this point the Chairman asked that the Board take up
a matter in closed session, with Messrs. Ash and Coyne leaving
the conference room and rejoining the meeting at the end of the
closed session. Chairman Clifford informed Mr. Coyne that the
Board had discussed a report and recommendation which Mr. Pace
had prepared for the Board's consideration, and the Board had
unanimously agreed to propose to the President that the position
of Executive Secretary to the Board be placed in Level IV of the
Executive Salary Schedule recently established by the Salary
Reform Act. Mr. Clifford said that as a part of this proposal
it would be suggested to the President that meanwhile the salary
of the Executive Secretary be raised to a level commensurate
with the compensation of positions classified in 4S-18, pending
Presidential action to place the position in Executive Level IV.
Mr. Coyne expressed to the Board his appreciation for this
action not only as it applied to him as incumbent of the
position, but also as an action in keeping with the work and
level of effectiveness required of the position in performing
on behalf of the President and the Board the responsibilities
involved.

The Board then recessed for a minute to greet former Board
member General Doolittle who had visited the Board's offices
to pay his respects to the members. (At the time of the visit,
through arrangements made by Mr. Coyne, General Doolittle was
debriefed by Mr. Henry Thomas of CIA in connection with the

Resuming in executive session, the Chairman called attention
to the next item on the regular agenda dealing with the audio-
surveillance and countermeasures problem generally, and with
the intelligence community's assessment of damage to the

-TOP SECRET
national security resulting from the 12-year penetration of the
U. S. Embassy in Moscow through the Soviet microphone system
which had recently been uncovered there. In this connection,
Mr. Pace observed that the September 24, 1964 report which the
Board had received from General Carter of CIA (concerning the
status of actions taken in response to Board Recommendation
No. 35 of June 1962) was not responsive to the Board's
recommendation calling for the organization of a major research
and development effort in the audiosurveillance field.

At 10:40 AM the Board meeting was joined by Messrs.
Richard Helms, Karamessines and Harold Osborne of CIA, and
Mr. Brown who represented the Director of Security of the
State Department.

Chairman Clifford asked Mr. Osborne of CIA (Chairman of
the USIB Security Committee) to speak to the intelligence
community's damage assessment of the Soviet microphone penetration
of the U. S. Embassy at Moscow.

Mr. Osborne read from a draft report on the damage assess-
ment, which was scheduled to be considered by the USIB Security
Committee on the following Tuesday preparatory to submission
to the USIB. He noted that the 52-microphone system had been
installed during the Soviet-controlled construction and renovation
of the Embassy building prior to its occupation by the U. S.
It was tentatively concluded that the penetration did serious
damage to the U. S. which is not possible of precise proof.
The penetration provided the Soviets at least with the knowledge
of Embassy operations, especially those of the U. S. military
attaches; knowledge of the Attaches' travel plans and intelligence
targets in the USSR; and information on the habits, problems
and weaknesses of Embassy personnel as a basis for possible
exploitation by Soviet Intelligence Services. Mr. Osborne said
that Ambassador Thompson has expressed the intention to give
the Security Committee a damage assessment which is understood
to reflect the judgment that the damage to U. S. political
interests was not serious and could only have given the Soviets
a short-run advantage.

Mr. Osborne said that the damage assessment has pointed
up certain deficiencies which have long been recognized by
U. S. security officers, namely: the fact that Soviet bloc
control of U. S. embassies during construction periods prevents
security inspections which would identify installations being
made of clandestine listening systems; the U. S. does not have
an effective technical capability to detect buried microphones;
and there is a need for a stronger interagency mechanism to
develop necessary countermeasures. He added that State now
has a program to demolish at least one room in each U. S. Embassy
located behind the Iron Curtain, and other U. S. agencies have
been invited to join State in the conduct of \"sweep\" procedures

TOP SECRET-
One action resulting from the Moscow incident has been
the alerting of appropriate U. S. agencies to the type of
installation uncovered in Moscow. The USIB will be asked to
urge the agencies involved to seek adequate funds and personnel
to perform necessary security inspections of facilities overseas.
The agencies will be asked to monitor the U. S. personnel who
were subject to compromise by Soviet technical penetrations,
to ensure that Soviet exploitation attempts are not successfully
made against them. It will be proposed that a new interagency
mechanism for countermeasures coordination be established within
the USIB, with a view to achieving such goals as U. S. observation
of the construction of our overseas facilities; the employment
of U. S. personnel rather than local maintenance personnel in
the Embassys; the assignment of more U. S. technicians to
security inspections of U. S. posts overseas; the assignment of
resident U. S. security technicians at sensitive posts abroad;
intensified security indoctrination and briefings of U. S.
personnel scheduled for assignment abroad; and expanded research
and development in the audiosurveillance countermeasures field.

Chairman Clifford asked whether the USIB Security Committee's
assessment had produced actual showings that the Soviets had
intercepted Embassy messages. (Mr. Clifford recalling the
incident last year when Khrushchev boasted to Ambassadors
Harriman and Kohler that he knew the contents of a message that
Kohler had sent to Washington recommending against U. S. approval
of a sale of West German pipe to the USSR.) Mr. Osborne could
shed no light on this. Mr. Coyne stated that he had followed
up with State Department several times regarding this incident
but the Department never had come up with a meaningful report.
Mr. Osborne said that Ambassador Thompson's forthcoming annex
to the Security Committee's assessment was expected to go into
the matter of whether the Soviets were known to have acted on
any information which was obtained through the microphone
penetration.

At Chairman Clifford's request, Mr. Helms spoke to the
subject. He observed that CIA has over 300 telephone taps and
These

operations not only are for intelligence collection, but they
also provide CIA with an idea of the kind of countermeasures
used by the opposition as, for example, in the case of the
Chinese Communists' discovery of CIA's audiosurveillance operation
directed against the Chinese in Geneva. Mr. Helms said that
without audio coverage the CIA would not have known that
Lee Harvey Oswald sought a visa at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City in 1963. In Burundi, when a Chicom attache defected to
the U.S. and asked for asylum, the Chicom Legation pressured
the Burundi Government to attempt to seize the defector and
return him to the Chicoms -- but CIA learned of this plan

TOP SECRET
through audiosurveillance coverage and was able to thwart the
Chicoms and spirit the defector out of Burundi to the U. S.

In answer to Mr. Clifford's inquiry, Mr. Helms said that
one major lesson learned from the Moscow penetration incident
is simply that such penetrations are just being invited when
the host country controls construction of the premises and
supplies the maintenance employees.

Dr. Baker asked what was being done to protect the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow and whether there are plans to use plastering
and paint to cover walls such as those in which pin-hole apertures
were found to lead to the concealed microphones. Mr. Brown
of State said that he understood that research and development
planning is being done on this. Dr. Baker observed that this
is not an R and D problem and that such materials are available
now for use in placing protective coatings on walls in our
sensitive facilities abroad. Dr. Baker recalled that the code-
room is jeopardized in the U. S. Embassy in Paris where the
Embassy is joined to a contiguous building not under our control,
and Dr. Baker wanted to know what is being done about that
situation. Mr. Brown of State was unable to say but he pointed
out that current countermeasures plans are directed to the
protection of U. S. posts in the Iron Curtain countries, not
France.

Dr. Land said that there appeared to be some protective
steps which could be done right away, such as \"painting and
plastering\" but it seemed that there is a bureaucratic problem
which prevents such action, and Dr. Land wondered what was
considered necessary to get the job done -- was it necessary
to obtain a Presidential Executive Order to do these things?
Mr. Helms commented that one of the USIB Security Committee's
recommendations will call for putting the responsibility in
the USIB and the agencies will look to the DCI for guidance in
such matters. Dr. Baker said that all this seemed confusing
because the individual agencies have responsibility in this
field, and he wondered whether a mere change in organizational
labels would provide the necessary coordination and action.
Mr. Helms thought that one task is to get the agency heads to
realize the importance of the problem of audiosurveillance
countermeasures. Dr. Baker observed that there are already in
existence NSC directives which emphasize the seriousness of the
threat. Mr. Gray pointed out in this connection that the
preliminary USIB damage assessment of the Moscow penetration
reflects that in some quarters in the State Department there
is the view that maybe it was a good thing if the Soviets did
get our information on the theory that the Soviets were thereby
convinced of the firm intentions back of U. S. policy pronouncements.

Chairman Clifford asked whether anyone in our Government
had ever considered the idea of telling the USSR in direct terms
HANDLE VIA
BYEMAN-COMINT
CONTROL SYSTEMS JOINTLY
TOP SECRET
NW 88132
Docld:34671875 Page 10

TOP SECRET
that we want to build an Embassy in Moscow ourselves, so that
we can be certain that there are no audiosurveillance systems
installed in it. Mr. Helms said that this is one answer and
should be tried, but right now there is a hassle about which
agency should chair the proposed new USIB Committee to coordinate
such matters. Mr. Brown of State said that consideration had
been given in the past to the possible use of U. S. employees
instead of local maintenance people. Granting this, Mr. Clifford
repeated his inquiry as to whether the intelligence community
had ever proposed that the U. S. adopt the policy of bluntly
telling the Soviets that we want the right to build a microphone-
free Embassy in Moscow. Mr. Helms knew of no such proposal
having been made by the intelligence community, but he thought
that this was a matter which the President's Board could deal
with in a recommendation to the President. Mr. Coyne at this
point read to the Board the text of Recommendation No. 16 which
the Board had made in the Dunlap Case (adoption of a U. S.
policy that the USSR not be permitted to build a new Embassy
in Washington unless the U. S. is given comparable permission
in Moscow), and the State Department's reply to the effect that
the U. S. was committed to the USSR in writing to help the
Soviets get a new Embassy in Washington, in return for the
Soviet action a few years ago in refurbishing and making available
the North Wing of the U. S. Embassy in Moscow (Mr. Coyne pointed
out that it was in this same North Wing that a number of
concealed microphone cable connections and antennae were found
in the course of digging out the recently-discovered microphone
system in the Embassy).

Chairman Clifford asked Mr. Helms to provide the Board
at an early date with a list of protective actions which could
be taken right now to increase defenses against audio penetrations
of our posts abroad. Mr. Helms agreed to do so.

Messrs. Helms, Osborne, Brown, et al, departed the Board
meeting at the conclusion of this agenda item.

Dr. Albert Wheelon, Deputy Director of CIA for Science and
Technology, joined the Board meeting, accompanied by Mr. Stevens
of CIA, to report to the Board on Soviet satellite reconnaissance
operations directed against the U. S. Describing this as the
Soviet COSMOS program, Dr. Wheelon said that of the total
number of Soviet satellite shots (46 in all) 17 have been
launched from Kapustin Yar. During the last three years 22
launchings have been made from Tyura Tam, and these were pretty
clearly reconnaissance satellites. These carried 10,000-pound
payloads in a photographic general search system like our
CORONA. The camera weighs 2000 pounds. Four of the shots,
however, were of the 15,000-pound payload variety, and are
spotting systems like our GAMBIT. The repetition rate over
U. S. targets is increasing. We are getting data on each mission,

being supplied through Burundi and Brazzaville. The Congo
situation could become dangerous to the U.S. position in
African public opinion. Chinese Communist influence is
persuasive, and several African countries will recognize
Communist China and vote for its admission into the U.N.
The Chicoms offered a Central African Republic $4 million
for diplomatic recognition, and got it.

With regard to the Cyprus situation, Mr. Cline noted
that although fighting has stopped neither side is backing
down. The Cypriot leader will not agree to the Turks' pro-
posal to rotate 1/3 of their troops on Cyprus unless the
Turk Cypriots withdraw from positions along the coast. The
USSR wants an independent Cyprus with a Communist-influenced
government. Nasser wants an independent Cyprus subject to
Egyptian influence. In reply to a question from Mr. Coyne,
Mr. Cline stated that the Navy SIGINT installation has been
scaled down so as to be ready for quick evacuation. This
cut-down in U.S. SIGINT coverage has been replaced somewhat
by installations in some Middle East capital cities.

Concerning South Vietnam, Mr. Cline said that the past
60 days have witnessed increased weakening of the political
fabric of the government of that country. Khanh's inability
to meet challenges is apparent, and his authority has
steadily eroded. Khanh is trying to build support from the
young officers and Bhuddists. (Mr. William Sullivan has
just returned to the U.S. and says that the SVN people
generally feel that the U.S. will pull out after the
November elections). There is no change in the military
situation, Mr. Cline said, but there is a creeping paralysis
in the SVN army. The Viet Cong is shifting from terrorism
and fighting to all-out political activity. In the USIB
yesterday CIA expressed the view that there will be further
political decay in SVN, increased friction with the U.S.,
and a petering out of the war effort.

In Cuba, there are signs that either the Soviets or
Cubans will begin shooting at our U-2's after the November
elections, and the \"303 Committee\" is studying courses of
action which mig it be taken by the U.S. in such an event.
One objective of the DCI's recent European trip was to
emphasize to NATO commanders that U.S. U-2 missions over
Cuba are not mere whimsy, but are necessary for intelligence
coverage which cannot be provided by satellite overflights.

At 11:00 a.m., Mr. Cline left the Board meeting which
was then joined by Under Secretary of the Air Force Brockway
McMillan (Director of the NRO) accompanied by General Stewart
the new Staff Director at the NRO (previously attached to
the Air Force Systems Command and the Air Staff).

At 3:00p.m., the Board meeting was joined by the Director
of Central Intelligence, Mr. McCone, and Mr. Kirkpatrick of CIA,
in order that the DCI might cover the items in which Board
members had indicated an interest in discussing with Mr. McCone.

Mr. Me Cone first took up the September Tonkin Gulf incident,
pointing out that he was out of the country when it occurred.
Mr. Me Cone said that previously in a meeting with the Secretaries
of State and Defense and the President, Mr. McCone had expressed
the view that if the proposed De Soto patrol remained outside the
12-mile limit it would not be attacked by the North Vietnamese
or Chicoms. The DCI said that the night before he left for
Europe he repeated this belief to the Secretary of Defense,
pointing out to him the absence of military attack preparations
and the lack of other indications of hostile intent. The DCI
felt that there was no real intelligence requirement for the
De Soto patrol which had in fact been proposed for the purpose
of emphasizing freedom of the seas and our right to enter the
Tonkin Gulf with U.S. vessels. At the time of the incident the
DCI was in conference with a NATO officer in Europe; and he
immediately put in a call to McGeorge Bundy on the KY-9 and
offered to return to Washington, but was told not to do so
because of the uncertainties as to the need for it. Mr. Mc Cone
pointed out to the Board that CIA's assessment in the Central
Intelligence Bulletin on Saturday morning reflected that there
was no evidence that Hanoi had ordered an attack on U.S. vessels
but that North Vietnam naval units had been alerted to avoid
acts of provocation and were concerned with defensive action
only if fired upon.

Mr. McCone noted the Board's expression of interest in
discussing a mechanism to improve current intelligence assess
ment and reporting of such incidents as the Tonkin Gulf episode.
He said that he had found room for improvement in one area:
certain NSA intercept messages had been passed back to the
field stations for processing, and had been sent to the
National Indications Center, but were not passed immediately
and directly to the CIA for analysis. Mr. McCone said that
he had since corrected this reporting procedure. In any case,
when the NSA messages reached the NIC they were sent on to CIA
without serious delay. However, Mr. McCone said, there developed
a dangerous situation which the Board should look at, namely,
the fact that top policy officials grabbed onto fragments of
raw intelligence and made decisions before the information had
been evaluated in the light of the total information available
and relevant to the situation. Policy officials should make use
of the evaluating machinery which is at hand.

Dr. Langer said he understood that there had been no inter-
agency evaluation of the SIGINT messages in the Tonkin Gulf in-
cident. Mr. McCone said that by the time the Central Intelligence.
Bulletin was ready for publication on Saturday morning there was
no opportunity for complete interagency coordination of the
HANDLE VIA

CONTROL SYSTEMS JOINTI

TOP SECRET
evaluation which CIA had made of the situation. Dr. Langer
wondered whether there was sufficient DIA and State Department
representation at the CIA center where the Central Intelligence
Bulletin was prepared. Dr. Langer added that the White House
staff followed the wrong procedure; that instead of querying
CIA, Mr. Bromley Smith had called Mr. Coyne for help in getting
a coordinated evaluation of the situation. Mr. Coyne corrected
this by pointing out that in fact Mr. Smith had talked to State
and others in the intelligence community; and thereafter called
Mr. Coyne to obtain help in getting an up-to-date comprehensive
summary of the SIGINT messages from NSA, and Mr. Coyne there
upon spent two days at NSA observing the work of NSA officials
in reviewing and summarizing the messages which had come in from
NSA field collection points, and the operational U.S. Navy
messages to the extent that they had been made available to NSA.

Mr. Pace thought it strange that the availability of a
channel to CIA had not been known to Mr. Bromley Smith, and
Mr. Mc Cone said that he too was surprised and intended to
discuss this with McGeorge Bundy.

Turning to the subject of Cuba, Mr. McCone said that he had
little to report in addition to that which he had reported to
the Board at its meeting before last. CIA has 100 agents re
porting on Cuba; they report comprehensively but under difficult
circumstances requiring resort to clandestine radio equipment
and secret writing reports through the mails. CIA has a
reasonable number of sources (14) in the Cuban diplomatic
corps, but Castro apparently doesn't have confidants among the
Cuban diplomatic corps abroad. CIA has relations with friendly
foreign diplomatic personnel inside Cuba. Mr. McCone said that
he is not satisfied with the information being obtained from
Cuba; the task is difficult; it is a matter of providing a
negative. CIA has had to rely mainly on U-2 coverage results to
check on the 45 reports received this year that there are Soviet
missiles in Cuba. The SA-2 sites have probably been over to
the Cubans by the Soviets, and a defector from an SA-2 crew has
told CIA about Cuban operations. Castro has expressed intention
to bring to the UN the matter of U.S. U-2's over Cuba, and has
told Danish and Norwegian officials that after the U.S. elections
in November, U.S. U-2's over Cuba will be shot down; Castro
claiming that U.S. can rely on satellite photography of Cuba
and must cease U-2 operations over the island. Mr. McCone said,
that by November 1, 1964, OXCART will be ready for missions
over Cuba at a speed of Mach 2.8 and 80,000 foot altitude.

As for South Vietnam, the DCI said that it is most difficult
to get intelligence on the Viet Cong. He has discussed with
Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, and the CIA Station Chief in Saigon,
how to improve this intelligence coverage. SVN intelligence
organizations get very little information concerning the Viet Cong

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE
SUBJECT: Meeting of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board
September 12-13, 1963.

At 9:00 a.m., September 12, 1963, the Board began a two day meeting i
in the Board's offices, Executive Office Building Present were Board
member's Clifford, Pace, Doolittle, Baker, Langer, Murphyland/Gray; and
also present were Messrs. Coyne and Ash.

In executive session, Chairman Clifford recalled that at the last
meeting the Board discussed ways and means of increasing its effectiveness,
and it had been agreed that ample time would be allotted for the discussion
of subjects covered throughout Board meetings. At this morning's session\"
two hours had been set aside, the Chairman announced, for discussion of the
vartous subject matters referred to in the first item on the agenda.

Turning to some administrative matters, inc, Cli made reference to
Mr. Coyne's August 5 memorandum regarding a request made to the Special
Counsel to the President for guidance to Foard members in complying with
newly-revised Federal legislation governing conflicts of interest, and
revised regulations calling for the submission of statements of financial
Interest (Board members having already submitted the latter some time ago
in compliance with the previous law and Presidential instructions). The
Chairman asked Mr. Ash to summarize the memorandum just received by Mr. Coyne
from Assistant Special Counsel White under, date of September 10, 1963,
suggesting the procedure which should now be followed under the new law.

The Board meeting was joined at this point by
Raymond G. Rocca (substituting for Mr. James Angleton of CIA)
for a briefing of Board members on CIA's counterintelligence
program.

Mr. Rocca began his briefing with the statement that
CIA does not have the entire world-wide responsibility
for counterintelligence (CI). To illustrate this point,
he exhibited a chart dated September 1962 entitled \"U.S.
Organization for Counterintelligence\" showing the various
elements of the numerous U. S. departments and agencies whose
functions and responsibilities bear some relationship to
counterintelligence Within CIA itself the CI function is
compartmented under the Deputy DCI for Plans. The headquarters
staff consists of 85 officers and 66 clerical personnel
(although there is a large number of CIA headquarters personnel
assigned to other intelligence activities which are related
to CIA's CI programs). At CIA stations overseas, CI. functions
are performed by various CIA personnel in such areas as Penetration,
Provocation, Double Agents, Technical Surveillances Protective
CI Services, Interrogations, and Deception.

Mr. Rocca stated that studies and recommendations made
by General Doolittle some 10 years ago had a great deal to do
with the fact that there is a separation in CIA of the handling
of CI activities and positive espionage operations

It was emphasized by Mr. Rocca that the CI program of
CIA is directed against the Soviet bloc espionage apparatus which
is operating against the United States, and the primary objective D
of the CI effort is to obtain intelligence concerning Soviet
bloc attempts to effect espionage penetrations of the United
States. Mr. Rocca also explained to the Board that within
CIA the responsibility for personnel security and physical
Security rests with the CIA Office of Security which is located
In the area of the Deputy DCI for Support, whereas the CE
program is located in the area of the Deputy DCI for Plans.

It became apparent in the discussion with Mr. Rocca
that Board members were primarily interested in the nature
and effectiveness of CIA personnel security programs (in.com-
parison to the NSA system which did not result in an identification
co Sergeant Dunlap during the three years which he acted as a
Soviet agent while employed in a sensitive area at NSA head
quarters). Accordingly, Mr. Rocca received a number of
questions from Board members which involved responsibilities
of the CIA Security Office and which Mr. Roccá could not answer
on the basis of first-hand knowledge. Within this limitation,
however, Mr. Rocca endeavored to be of assistance to the Board
in response to various members! questions which he answered

ness of the nature of the Soviet penetration threat.

In answer to Mr. Coyne's question, Mr.Rocca said that
although there is no evidence of over-all penetration of
U. S. Government agencies, we must assume that such penetrations
are being effected, and we should recognize that the size and
complexity of our Governmental organization and the members
of departments and agencies which are targets for Soviet bloc
penetration efforts make us \"a sitting duck.\"

Upon Mr. Rocca's departure at 3:30 PM。,the Board resumed
in executive session。

Referring to Mr. Rocca's appearance before the Board,
/
Chairman Clifford said it was apparent that the Board had been
hearing from a representative of the wrong, CIA area, as indicated
by the fact that Mr. Rocca had found it necessary to say that
most of the Board members questions fell in the area of com-
petence and knowledge of the CIA Security Office headed by Mr.
Bannerman, Mr. Gray agreed that Mr. Rocca had been unable to
respond to the questions in which the Board was particularly
interested。

Chairman Clifford referred to General Blake's appearance
before the Board earlier in the day, and Mr. Clifford pointed
out that the NSA Director had emphasized his confidence in the
thousands of good and reliable people who are employed at NSA。

Mr. Pace said that he was concerned about the heavy
investment of time and money on security without a program vớ
to make it clear what the threat is. The absence of publics
awareness of the threat has in Mr. Pacels opinion resulted
in a popular notion that the word \"traitor\" is no longerang
an opprobrious term in peace time, and the peace time impact
of treason is less than in war time. (General Doolittle observed
that the impact of treason is punishment by death, which is aumb
pretty firm impact.)

Next, the Board meeting was joined by Mr, Desmond Fitzsia
gerald (head of the CIA headquarters group concentrating on
Cuba) and his assistant, Mr. Bruce Clark, who were present to
brief the Board on covert actions being directed against the 000
Castro Covernment. Chairman Clifford asked the CIA representaшеск
tive to confine the discussion to 25 minutes in view of changesis
which had been required in the Board's schedule.

Mr. Clark informed the Board thật CIA has kept a close
watch on the situation in order to reach an estimate on the number
of Soviet forces in Cuba. Recently, he said, the Intelligence
community arrived at its estimate, and at the last Presidential
Press Conference the President had answered questions on the
subject, without getting into numbers, an approach which Mr.
Clark favored He said that CIA estimates there are from 6,000
to 10,000 Soviet personnel in Cuba, and the range of this estimate
is indicative of the difficulty of estimating the number of Soviet
ground forces The Soviets control and operate the SAM system
and related communications. There are no longer any Soviet

ground units as such because they were removed along with the
missiles and IL-28's in: February. Cubans now control and
operate all the MIG aircraft although the Cubans continue to
receive training from Soviet pilots. Also the Cubans control
the helicopters and use them effectively in counterinsurgency
activity. Cruise missile sites and the KOMAR boats are
cperated by Cubans。

In air defense there are some 2,300 to 3,000 Soviet
military tech cians, but these personnel are not likely to
be the kind to bear arms against an insurrection in Cuba,
Mr. Clark stated。 It was on July 12 that Cubans began to
receive Soviet training in SAM site operations, and the
training will extend over 10 months. Therefore in April 1964,
Cubars will be prepared to take over the SAM sites and related
communications。 Some 300 Soviet personnel are estimated to
be engaged in training Cubans in the operation of 12 patrol
boats。 Some 800 Soviets are assigned to cruise missile
activities。 And Soviet ground forces number between 2,000 and

In answer to a question from Mr. Clifford, Mr. Clark
said that there have been no substantial new arrivals of
Soviet personnel in Cuba. However, CIA does not get enough
information on loadings and urioadings from vessels because
of Cuban port security measures.

Mr. Clark said that from 3,000 to 4,000 Soviets would
be expected to conduct MAAG-type: operations in Cuba. In
answer to Dr. Langer's question, he said that CIA has no knowledge
of the number of Soviet agricultural advisers in Cuba.

Mr. Fitzgerald began his presentation with the remark
that this was a good day to be talking to the Board because
yesterday CIA was in a position to disseminate the best intelligence
report received to date on the situation in Cuba. He showed
Board members a copy of the agent report which he said had come
from a \"high level Commandante\" in the Cuban army who is a
reliable source. Mr. Fitzgerald also read from another CIA
agent report which quoted a source as saying that not even Fidel
Castro can enter Soviet military installations in Cuba, anyone
who reports knowledge of the level of Soviet forces in Cuba is
lying.

Mr. Fitzgerald said that the level of CIA resources directed
against Cuba includes 467 CIA personnel at headquarters and in
Miami, and 45 CIA personnel at CIA stations overseas There are
also 595 foreign sources, mostly Cubans.

At the present time, Mr. Fitzgerald said, CIA has a
number of integrated covert operations which were approved by
the Standing Group and by the President。 The six-part program

of the integrated program are:

(2) Propaganda actions to stimulate resistance efforts and
sabotage within Cuba,
(3) Action to stimulate disaffection in the Cuban military f
which CIA considers is the strongest group which can be expected
\"to successfully seek the overthrew of Castro.
(4) A program of economic denial on an increasing basis.
The Cuban economy is already suffering. Ninety percent of Cuban
industry uses U. S. machinery, and replacement parts cannot be
obtained from the United States。(Mr. Fitzgerald agreed with
Mn. Murphy that Cuba can look to Canada for needed materials.)

Mr. Clifford asked Mr. Fitzgerald who is responsible for
the raids reportedly launched against Cuba in recent times
The answer was that CIA is responsible for only a relatively
few of the raids that have been publicized. On two occasions,
August 17 and 19, CIA put \"ship-borne teams into Cuba, but CIA
isn't responsible for the bombing raids with planes which have
been staged by Cuban exiles from the Bahamas。 (CIA thinks
these raids are ineffective and would prefer that they be stopped)

The DCI then referred to the problem of CIA's limited access
to the US. Embassy in Moscow. He said that there are sources in
the USSR who would be willing to work with the CIA if the Agency
had personnel on the scene to operate these sources。 Mr. McCone
noted that there are only four CIA people in theEmbassy, along
with some 17 US military personnel。 In contrast, Mr. McCone
noted, in the U.S.there are 185 Soviet and 93 Soviet satellite
intelligence officials operating against the U.S. in the Washington
D. C. and New York (UN) areas。 The DCI stated that on the question
of placing additional CIA personnel under official cover in the
Embassy at Moscow, the Ambassador has steadfastly held that the risk
of damage from exposure of such personnel is so severe that it is
not worth the gamble. Therefore, Mr. McCone said, CIA has only four
men in the Moscow Embassy and they would all have to work on any
one case。 Recalling that several CIA operatives had to be taken
out of Moscow when the Penkovskiy case blew up, the DCI empha-

to Mr. Clifford's inquiry as to what steps were being taken by the
DCI to obtain authorization for the assignment of additional CIA
personnel to the Embassy in Moscow, Mr. McCone said that he has had
conversations with the head of the State Department. However, housing
for U.S. personnel is limited in Moscow and the net result of in
creasing CIA personnel there would probably necessitate the re-
moval of a State Department political officer or some other State
Department representative。

Mr. McCone referred to the Vietnam situation as being very bad, with
a disintegration of relations between the Diem regime and the Vietnamese and
the U. S The situation is so bad we may have to get out of the war. The
U. S. could live with Diem's antagonism but he has lost popular support and
winning the war would be & hollow victory. The U. S. has had no success in
getting Diem to mend his policy. The shooting into a crowd of Buddhists and
the deaths of 8 of them began an impossible situation, and the August raids on
the pagodas were the last straw. If the Diem regime were to be disposed of,

Some think if we can get Diem to do reforms we can win the war and
get out Others think Diem should be overthrown.
In answer to Mr. Clifford, the DCI said that State Department and CIA
collaboration is close on the Vietnam situation. He added however that there
was no coordination of the hastily composed August 24 cablegram from the
State Department telling the Embassy to begin thinking about \"unloading the
Nhus\" and that a change of the regime was in the offing.

Mr. Clifford invited the DCI to take up any other matters he wished to
coveri Mr. McCone said there were a few that time didn't permit him to cover,
but he would furnish the Board memoranda on \"Deep Cover\" and \"Soviet Trawlers\".

As to scheduled CORONA launchings care should be taken as to their.
frequency having in mind that CORONA shots cost $9 million each and GAMBIT
$12 million.

Mr. Gray mentioned to the DCI a recent remark made by Alexis Johnson to
some of the Board members to the effect that although the U. S. can put a man
on the moon for a billion dollars, we can't place an agent in Castro's office.

Mr. Gray said that he would like to hear Mr. McCone's comments to the Board
some time as to the prospect of CIA penetrating the USSR and Cuban Governments
if unlimited millions or billions of dollars were available. Mr. Clifford
agreed that the Board should hear from the DCI on this at the next Board
meeting. Mr. McCone's visit completed, he departed the Board meeting at 12:15.

Following lunch, the Board resumed in executive session. Mr. Coyne
reported some information just received in the Dunlap case. Dunlap's wife
produced another Government document which her husband had apparently removed
from NSA. She said she found it in a strong box to which her husband was not
supposed to have had a key. NSA Director Blake had informed Mr. Coyne that
the document was from NSA to overseas stations on steps to be taken in tests
of procedures with respect to intercepts of Soviet scrambler traffic.

Dr. Baker noted that this is serious, because our only hope for exploiting
Soviet scrambler communications is to take advantage of operator and encryption
mistakes, so any reminder to the Soviets that NSA personnel are looking for
\"busts\" will be very bad.

Dr. Baker said that the DCI's remark about Dunlap being at the cross-
roads of NSA information is untrue, because in fact Dunlap had access only

to the crossroads of NSA activity against Soviet SIGINT. Also Dr. Baker
said that the DCI's comments on CIA'S WALNUT data system were exaggerated,

for in fact the project has proved to be a useless disaster to say the least,
and it is certainly not a \"leading edge\" to automation as the DCI had claimed.
Dr. Baker and Mr. Coyne had recently received word on the inadequacy of the
WALNUT system from Mr. Griffith of IBM, privately.

Chairman Clifford agreed with Mr. Coyne's suggestion that at the next

Mr. McGeorge Bundy joined the Board meeting at 1:30 and addressed himself
to the items which had been listed in Mr. Clifford's memorandum to Mr. Bundyat
dated September 11, 1963 (attached as a part of these minutes)
1
Also,
First Mr. Bundy expressed the view that there have been significant
improvements in intelligence community support to the White House.. This is
particularly true with respect to current intelligence topics specially covered
by CIA'S OCI. These submissions are useful to the President and White Houser
staff, members because they are mor more timely than NIE's and supply oply the need
for information without having to wait for the results of the necessarily
slower process of turning out finished estimates

Also, Mr. Bundy said the White House is getting good ad hoc reporting
from Department of State intelligence (INR). Some of it goes to the President
and it is of value to staff members in discussions with the President.
Also,
DIA's material forwarded to General Clifton is a useful supplement to more
formally prepared estimates.

meetings and if a particular intelligence memorandum is needed it is asked for

TOP SECRET
bu largely the initiative is with State, Defense, and CIA in making these:
current intelligence submissions.

In short, Mr. Bundy said that the means of access to intelligence are
good, for policy purposes.

As to the second item on the Board's list, Mr. Bundy said he would have
to throw back to the Board the question as to any modifications considered
desirable in providing intelligence community support to the White House
(in the light of the Board's Cuba report). Mr. Bundy thought that he would
not be as good a witness on the Board on this.

Dr. Land remarked that this morning the Board heard optimistically
worded reports by CIA on the responsiveness of Cubans to small sabotage efforts,
but when the CIA representatives were asked about a long range plan for use in
case of a coup in Cuba, they indicated that they had none. Dr. Land also
wondered whether we would have advance intelligence on a coup in time for
our Government to act on it. Mr. Bundy said that we do have an intelligence
Input on the question of whether a coup would result in unacceptable Soviét
reaction, and the tentative judgment that there would not be.
ه مسافر
Mr. Clifford recalled remarks by the CIA representatives to the effect
that if agent teams now being sent into Cuba are caught, CIA will get the
blame as it does in the case of non-CIA covert actions detected by the Castro
regime. Mr. Bundy agreed that this is not a very good defense when agent
teams are caught and their activities are attributed to CIA by Castro.

Mr. Bundy said that the Standing Group file on Cuba is large and Mr. Coyne
might well look through it.

Mr. Murphy wondered whether the intelligence effort is adequately tied
in to the policy process, and he cited the August 24 State Department message
to Saigon representatives indicating a policy change. Mr. Bundy said that the
State Department message was not very well coordinated in its preparation,
but there was no failure of intelligence involved.

Next, as to the adequacy of intelligence community production of timely,
cumulative assessments of current intelligence and indicator-type data, for
example in the South Vietnam situation, Mr. Bundy said that the intelligence
record on problems developing there since last May is pretty good. The
difficulty is that when you get into a matter involving daily operational-type
policy decisions, it is not easy to keep track of the very latest developments.
From now on, Mr. Bundy said that steps will be taken to make sure that the
Standing Group and Executive Committee of the NSC have the same daily \"new news!!
as their various intelligence officers do. The principal question regarding
Vietnam is what does Diem actually think he is doing. Raw intelligence
material is not lacking, Mr. Bundy said, but assessment is the problem.
J
:
As to the fourth question listed by the Board, Mr. Bundy said that it
would cause a problem if the Board were to be made recipients of the daily
CIA. Presidential Check List, because the Board would then be getting something
to which the rest of the White House family does not have access. Mr. Bundy
said that he analyzes the Check List on a daily basis and this has resulted.
in the President getting sharper information. However, Mr. Bundy said that
it would be a good thing if Mr. Coyne would look over past Check Lists for
periods of perhaps a month, with a view to analyzing the submissions.

TOP SECRET
As to the fifth and last item in Mr. Clifford's list (inviting
suggestions for increasing the Board's access to covert action matters and
Special Group activities) Mr. Bundy said that he frankly did not know the
Board's present method of covering NSC 5412/2 matters. Dr. Langer said that
the Board Panel on the subject gets briefings from time to time on covert
action operations. Mr. Bundy stated that he himself looks to CIA for reports
asked for concerning the status of particular programs, but he did not want
to have in his fice & compilation of all of such sensitive activities.
But if the Board appoints a Panel to do a review of all covert actions to
date, or of selected programs, he stands ready to meet the Board's needs.

Mr. Clifford said that he or Mr. Coyne would be in touch with Mr. Bundy
regarding the desired review of NSC 5412/2 activities.

Chairman Clifford then turned to the subject of the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, noting that the Board had looked at U. S. intelligence capability
to detect violations. He said that it appeared thus far that the U. S.
capability is largely based on the acquisition and enlargement of detection
systems in the future. Mr. Buncy said that he is concerned about the U. S.
capability to apply intelligence safeguards against the treaty violations,
but is unwilling to sign a blank check for detection programs. So the Board
should keep aware of the question as to the worth of adopting certain additional
detection systems, and in Mr. Bundy'

PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE ADVISORY BOARD
(3)

Origin of the Board: From 1946 to 1954 a variety of ad hoc groups
were constituted at the Presidential level to review selected aspects
of the total U.S. foreign intelligence effort.

In 1955 the Hoover Commission on Organization of the Executive
Branch of the Government recommended a permanent bi-partisan \"Watch
Dog Committee\" (to be composed of members of both Houses of Congress
and of public-spirited citizens) to make periodic surveys of the
organization, functions, policies and effectiveness of the foreign
intelligence activities of the several Government agencies concerned,
reporting thereon both to the Congress and the President. President
Eisenhower rejected this proposal.

In February 1956, as a tactic to forestall creation of a Watch
Dog Committee, President Eisenhower issued an Executive Order (Tab A)
establishing his own Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence
Activities, to maintain a continuing, independent review of all U.S.
foreign intelligence activities. President Eisenhower's Board
functioned continuously from February 1956 to January 1961. (The
membership of the Eisenhower Board is listed under Tab B.)

In January 1961, President Kennedy decided that there was a
continuing need for a Presidential advisory board on foreign intelli-
gence, but deferred temporarily the appointment of new members. In
the interim he requested that the Executive Secretary of the prior
Board remain in office and that he continue to review and report
to the President on the conduct of our foreign intelligence effort.

Mission of the Board: On May 4, 1961 following the disaster suffered
by the US, at Cuba's Bay of Pigs, the President, by Executive Order
No. 10938 (Tab (C), established the President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board. This Order directs the Board (a) to conduct acon-
tinuing, independent review and assessment of all functions of the
departments and agencies having responsibilities in \"the foreign
intelligence and related fields\" and (b) to advise the President with
respect to the objectives and conduct of these activities, which
are required in the interest of foreign policy, national defense
and security. The phrase \"related fields\" pertains to highly
sensitive covert operations relating to political action, propaganda,
economic warfare, sabotage, escape and evasion, subversion against
hostile states or groups and support of indigenous and anti-communist
elements in threatened countries of the free world. These covert.
cperations are to be conducted in such manner that, if uncovered,...
the U. S. Government can plausibly disclaim responsibility for them.

Membership of the Board: President Kennedy's Executive Order
provides that \"members members of the Board shall be appointed from among.
qualified persons outside the Government...\" All appointment atments to

the Board have been made on that basis. (The Board's membership is.
listed under Tab D.) The Board was chaired initially by Dr.
James Killian, Jr. In April 1963 when Dr. Killian resigned, President
Kennedy appointed Mr. Clark Clifford as Chairman. In appointing
Mr. Clifford, the President directed that the Board \"continue to
perform the highly important function of maintaining an independent
review and assessment of the objectives and conduct of the foreign
intelligence and related activities of the departments and agencies
having responsibilities in this field.\" (Tab E):

Coincident with Mr. Clifford's appointment, the President
made a public announcement emphasizing that he would \"continue to
look to the Board for non-partisan, objective appraisals of the
activities of our intelligence agencies in order to assure their
efficient management and maximum effectiveness.\" (Tab F)

Review Procedures of the Board: The Board maintains its continuing,
independent review and assessment of U.S. foreign intelligence
activities and covert action operations through the following means:

(1) Panels (composed of designated Board Members and the
Executive Secretary) which are responsible for keeping the full
Board informed with respect to significant actions, problems, gaps,
overlaps, and deficiencies, in specified areas of the overall foreign
intelligence effort.

(2) On-the-scene reviews, both in the U.S. and abroad, of
intelligence-related activities. These reviews (made by designated
Members and/or the Executive Secretary) encompass pertinent activ-
ities of the CIA, the Departments of State and Defense, the Unified
and Specified Commands, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the
National Security Agency and the Service Cryptologic Agencies. Such
reviews have been made at the Seat of Government, elsewhere in the
Continental U.S., in Latin America, Scandanavia, Europe, Africa,
the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the Far East.

(3) Review of periodic progress reports and special reports,
submitted to the Board by the military and civilian intelligence
agencies.

(4) Review of major Intelligence publications, produced on a
daily, weekly, monthly, or \"spot\" basis by the Central Intelligence
Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Department of State, and
by the U.S. intelligence community collectively. These publications
include current intelligence reports and appraisals of significant.
day-to-day developments, National Intelligence Estimates, Special
Intelligence Estimates, and the intelligence results of satellite
and aircraft reconnaissance missions.

(5) ^ Briefings on selected intelligence topics from agency
heads and other officials associated with the several U.S.
intelligence agencies.

(6) Discussions, as appropriate, with the Secretaries of
State and Defense, the Chairman, JCS, the President's Special

Assistant for National Security Affairs, the Director of Central
Intelligence, and the Heads of the several intelligence agencies.

(7) Frequent meetings of the full Board.A

Meetings of the Board: (From May 1961 through November 1963,
President Kennedy's Board held 25 separate meetings covering a
total of 39 days. These meetings included sessions with thể t
President, which provided opportunities for discussion of topics of
major significance. (President Eisenhower's Board held 18 meetings
covering a total of 39 days during its five-year tenure.).

Recommendations of the Board: During the past 2 years the Board
submitted to the President a total of 170 recommendations, summar-
ized under Tab G. (During its five year tenure the Eisenhower
Board made 42 recommendations; these are summarized under Tab H.)
A large percentage of the recommendations made by President Kennedy's
Board involved activities internal to the Department of Defense; a
lesser proportion involved activities internal to the Central
Intelligence Agency and the Department of State; a number of them
related to activities of joint interest to two or more member
agencies of the Intelligence Community. Of the 170 recommendations,
the President approved 125, disapproved 2, and temporarily deferred
final action on the remainder. Of the 125 approved recommendations,
implementing actions on 85 have been substantially tantially completed. The
remaining Presidentially-approved recommendations deal with
substantive intelligence matters warranting continued Board attention
and, possibly, the submission of further Board recommendations to
the President.

Intelligence Areas of Major Concern: These include:

(1). The ever-increasing cost, size and complexity of the
overall intelligence effort. This fiscal year the effort will
cost $3.7 billion. Its personnel strength is in excess of 149,000
(Of this number,over 131,000 are in the Department of Defense and
17,000 in CIA.) The effort is diffused throughout a number of
Government agencies including the Departments of State, Defense,
Army, Navy, Air Force; the Defense Intelligence Agency; the
National Security Agency; the Service Cryptologic Agencies; the
Unified, Specified and Component Commands; and the Central
Intelligence Agency.

(2) The acquisition on a priority basis of crucially-needed
intelligence on the long-range missile capability of the Sino-Soviet
bloc.

(3) The National Reconnaissance Program for the collection of
photographic and signals intelligence through surveillance satellites,
manned aircraft and drones (e.g. CORONA, LANYARD, GAMBIT, ARGON, U-2,
OXCART, TAGBOARD).

(4) The Signals Intelligence Program for the interception and
analysis of the governmental and military communications of f foreign
governments, and of electronics emanations associated with their
missile and space vehicle activities.

Rec. #16: That, because the need for intelligence on
Soviet nuclear and missile capabilities is
more urgent than the current need for geodetic
and mapping information, urgent action be
taken as follows: (1) the scheduling of as
many additional CORONA shots as possible
in, the coming months, with postponement of
ARGON shots, if necessary; (2) the THOR-CORONA
system to be relied upon as the photographic
reconnaissance \"work horse\" while other systems

availability to permit future CORONA flights
for quasi-tactical objectives.

(Subsequently, based on information obtained
in the course of its continuing review of
the National Reconnaissance Program, the Board
submitted to the Special Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs a report
dated July 5, 1963, in which the Board:
(1) roted a sugnificant series of failures
which had occurred in photographic reconnaissance
satellite missions, because of malfunctions of
booster and other systems; and (2) suggested
that the President's office appropriately re-
emphasize the urgent need for achieving and
maintaining a dependable and continuing photo-
graphic reconnaissance satellite capability
lest our Government be denied vitally-needed
intelligence essential to our intelligence-
estimating and policy-formulating processes
relative to the Sino-Soviet bloc.)

The Board re-emphasized to the President its
convictions to the importance of outlining
to the newly-chosen DCI the objectives of
previous Board recommendations concerning
the coordinating role of the DCI. (See Rec. #1.)

Rec. #23-a: With respect to the National Reconnaissance
Office (NRO), the Board proposed that it
review, with the Defense Department and the
CIA, the contemplated organizational structure
of the NRO for purposes of clarifying its
responsibilities and increasing its effective-
ness in the coordinated management and operation.
of all satellite and overhead reconnaissance
projects.

Board Report of June 26, 1962
Rec. #23-b : With further reference to the National Recon-
naissance Office, the Board noted that the
NRO agreement between the Secretary of Defense
and the DCI was not adequate to support an
efficient NRO organization; and the Board recom-
mended further study to achieve a better
documentary basis for the NRO with particular
Reference to National Security Council directives
possibly in conflict with the NRO plan then
existing.

Board Report of March 8, 1963
Rec. #23-c: With further reference to the National Recon-
naissance Office (NRO) the Board recommended
that a recently-completed draft of a new NRC
agreement be adopted by the Secretary of Defense
and the DCI, and that in the implementation of
the NRO plan there be: (1) a clear channel of
guidance and authorization from the policy
decisions of the President to the Secretary of
Defense and to the DCI; (2) a clear and effective
connection between the advance technology and
planning of the National Reconnaissance Program
and the development of plans for reconnaissance
capabilities for the Department of Defense
and the military services; (3) plans for improved
continuity of management of the NRO, particularly

for new satellites, aircraft and other recon-
naissance instruments; (4) accion to ensure
that Department of Defense directives which

are consistent with pertinent directives from
higher authority, such as National Security
Council Intelligence Directives; and (5) within
the Defense Department a clarification of
present and planned retionships as botween
the NRO, the Defense Intelligence Agency
and the National Security Agency.

Board Report of October 17, 1961
Rec. #24: That the Special NSC 5412/2 Group review the
paramilitary operations being carried out by
the CIA in Laos (and elsewhere) to determine
whether those operations, given their present

when this would unduly delay the reporting
process.

(3) That U. S. Ambassadors be made aware of the
capability and security of emergency clandestine
radio stations installed in selected U.S.
Embassies.

SUBJECT: November 21-22, 1963, Meeting of the
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board

November 21, 1963

The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board convened in
Executive Session at 9:00 a.m. November 21, 1963, on the first day of a
scheduled two-day meeting, at the Board's offices, Room 297. Executive Office
Building. Present were Chairman Clifford; members Land, Gray, Langer and
Doolittle; J. Patrick Coyne, Executive Secretary; and A. R. Ash.

Chairman Clifford informed Board members that in this two-day meeting
consideration would be given to the Soviet espionage case involving the late
J. S. Army Sergeant Jack E. Dunlap, previously assigned to the National
Security Agency by the Army Security Agency. Mr. Clifford said that the
Board was in a position to do a unique service in this situation, and was
the only Government entity engaged in a detailed, full-time review of the
counterintelligence, and national security ramifications of the case.

Chairman Clifford advised Board members that some of the facts involved are
extremely sensitive and must be given extreme security. (Here Mr. Clifford
outlined to the Board the substance of highly sensitive information which
had been given orally to Mr. Coyne by FBI Director Hoover for the information
of the Board and the President with respect to a uniquely valuable intelli-
gence source which supplied information concerning the espionage activities
of Dunlap.)

The Board re-convened at 8:45 a.m. in executive session. Chairman
Clifford announced that General Carroll had called to emphasize that during
his remarks yesterday he did not intend to be critical of corrective
measures taken by General Blake (Director of NSA) after the Dunlap case,
rather, his criticisms were directed at the situation existing prior theretc.

Board members directed their attention to a further review of materials
relating to the Dunlap case, and to further work on the draft of the Board's
report to President Kennedy.

(Messrs. Pace and Murphy joined the meeting.)

At. 10:00 a.m. the Board meeting was joined by Mr. McCone, DCI, who
was accompanied by CIA officials Kirkpatrick and Helms.

Mr. Clifford informed the DCI that the Board would appreciate his:
comments on the subject matters which had previously been indicated as of
interest to the Board, and in any comments on other subjects which the DCI
or his associates might wish to make

Mr. McCone said that he was prepared to discuss all of the items listed
by the Chairman, plus 3 additional subjects: (1) the Soviet Space Analytical
Center (2) organizational changes in regard to CIA's scientific and technical
activities, and (3) Vietnam. He said that at noon he would have available
to the Board Mr. William Colby, CIA headquarters official assigned to Far
East matters, who had just returned from a several weeks' visit to Vietnam
at President Kennedy's request. Mr. McCone said that he himself would have
to leave the meeting at 12:20 in order to keep an appointment with
McGeorge Bundy.

First Mr. McCone said he wanted to refer most emphatically to the
damage being done to CIA through adverse publicity appearing in the press,
radio and TV in a campaign which, if not arrested, could well destroy the
CIA If the campaign continues, it will prevent CIA recruitment of good
men, and will discourage present CIA personnel at all levels in the organiza
tion. Mr. McCone said that there is little he ca can do to dissuade the press
from pursuing this line for ideological reasons or otherwise. There are
those in the Defense Department who have opposed CIA ever since it was
established, and there are Foreign Service Officers in the State Department
who are highly critical of the CIA

Mr. McCone urged most emphatically that the Board bring this matter
to President Kennedy's attention and to urge the President to take not one
but several occasions to try to correct the CIA's public image. For example,
CIA has been accused of being a \"Third Government in South Vietnam\", and
various people have been led to the erroneous conclusion that the anti-Diem
coup was engineered by CIA. One result of irresponsible charges may be that
Cambodia will swing over to the Communist camp

Mr. Clifford asked whether these criticisms are traceable back to the
Bay of Pigs as a turning point. Mr. McCone said yes, and back to CIA'3
involvement in Guatemala. The criticisms of CIA make interesting copy for
writers who know there will be no denial or defense. For some reason or
other extreme liberals in and out of Government feel that a secret intelli-
gence service is contrary to the democratic principles of our Government.
The N. Y. Times is particularly critical and Times staffer James Reston
would destroy CIA if he had his way; and the Washington Post from top to
bottom is opposed to CIA.

Mr. Gray asked if Mr. McCone was suggesting that the President should
talk to the Secretaries of State and Defense about criticisms of CIA made
by persons in those Departments. Mr. McCone said, no, what must be done
is for the President to make the matter the subject of a major speech and
several press conferences General Doolittle inquired whether Mr. McCone
had discussed this with the President, and Mr. McCone replied that he had
and this was the reason for remarks which the President made 30 days ago
during a press conference. Mr. Murphy observed that public statements of
the kind urged by Mr. McCone often have a way of proving to be a liability,
because they may generate a whole flock of further press and radio commentaries;
and for this reason Mr. McCone might consider the prospect of having to ride
out this storm.

Dr. Land asked what is the CIA's role in Vietnam. Mr. McCone said
its role was not to overthrow governments, and there are many other reasons
why CIA is in Vietnam. Dr. Land asked what, however, should the President
publicly say about CIA's role in Vietnam. Mr. McCone said that he could
supply the President with that.

Chairman Clifford stated that the matter raised by Mr. McCone is
an area in which he would hope that the Board might be of assistance. How-
ever, Mr. Clifford did not know how much the President could do in the way
of public statements to the press. Perhaps a lot could be done within
Government to stop damaging leaks of information from the various departments
and agencies. Mr. Clifford said that the Board would address itself to the
problem. Mr. McCone agreed that leaks are a part of the problem, and here-
called that the editor of News Week told him that he obtained information
from State Department, but the editor would not name the source.

Turning to the subject of Counterintelligence which was included
on the Beard's list of items of interest, Mr. McCone asked Mr. Helras
to speak to this inatter.

Mr. Helms said that in looking at the subject of our counterintelligence
posture he preferred to refer to it as \"counter-espionage\". He said that it
is the most dreary and least attractive job that CLA has. When CLA goes out
for positive collection of intelligence in an espionage operation, the
objective is clear e.g., the obtaining of information about a Soviet
missile site. But counterespionage is like Blind Man's Buff where you know
someone is in the room but you aren't certain who it is. There is a passive
side of the effort, involving security checks, safes, fences, guards, etc.;
but if the counter effort is only passive, it continues to be a game of
Blind Man's Buff. Therefore, a counterespionage activity is needed for the
purpose of identifying hostile espionage agents. In this latter activity CIA
has about 5 years to go before getting to the level that is desired.

Mr. Helms pointed out that the USSR not only has an aggressive cold war
policy but it uses the instruments of the GRU and the KCB operating in
parallel with coordination taking place under, Khrushchew in Moscow where
decisions are reached as to dividing up the slots and espionage missions
between the GRU and the KGB

Next Mr. Helms exhibited a chart reflecting a number of espionage cases
which have been uncovered as a result of CIA's counterintelligence efforts:
the Able case (an illegal KGB agent who was located by the FBI in New York
after Able's subordinate defected to the CIA in Paris); Blake (of Britain's
MI-6 who worked for the Soviets for 6 years until uncovered as a result of &
Polish defection to the CIA); Philby (the old school tie MI-6 official whose
Soviet espionage recruitment dates back to 1934 and who recently fled to the

USSR from the Middle Past); Clemens and Felfe (who served 9 years in the
West German counterespionage service, and were uncovered through a Polish
defector's tip to CIA); Cox (a U. S. citizen who took $500 from the Soviets,
returned the money, suffered a heart attack, and the case dropped by U. S.
authorities); Ethel and Harry Houghton (uncovered through a tir from a Polish
defector); the Krugers (a U. S. couple whose real names were Cohen and who
disappeared in 1950); the Lansdale case in England; Vassalls (a homosexual
clerk in the British Admiralty); and Wennerstrom (CIA didn't give the Swede's
a direct lead to this Soviet agent, but CLIA laid out to officials of Sweden
the manner in which the Soviets would effect a penetration, and when the
Swede's surveyed their situation they found that Wennerstrom fit the prototype,
with the result that Wennerstrom confessed when confronted.) Mr. Helms also
presented another chart dealing with cases of espionage penetrations by other
Soviet bloc intelligence services including Czechs, East Germans, Poles and
Yugoslavs

Mr. Murphy asked whether CIA had concurred in the U. S. release of the
Soviet espionage agent, Able, in exchange for U-2 pilot Powers. Mr. Helms
said that considerations of national interest prevailed in that decision,
although CIA's counterintelligence officers objected to the action.

As a result of information gained through CIA's counterespionage efforts,
CIA has informed French and Israeli governments that the KGB is obtaining
information from them. The worst situation is in the French government which
has recently arrested the Soviet agent Pacques, and this action by the French
government may be an indication that they are moving against Soviet espionage
infiltrations. CIA believes in the accuracy of information it has received
from a Soviet defector that there are 10 or 12 high placed French officials
serving as Soviet agents

DOD SECRET

Mr. Clifford asked whether this situation should cause the U. S.
to furnish less information to the foreign governments involved. Mr. Helms
said that CIA is recommending to the USIB that there be less distribution
of sensitive papers placed in the hands of foreign recipients, but that these
foreign governments be provided more counterintelligence information to
protect themselves against Soviet espionage penetrations (for example, West
Germany is crawling with hundreds of East Cerman agents).

In answer to General Doolittle's question as to motivations in these
cases, Mr. Helms said that in the Western world the primary motivations
have been desire for money, blackmail pressures, ideology, and vanity (the
agent Blake enjoyed confessing how well he had fooled his British superiors)。
In blackmail situations, the Soviets develop leads as to personality defects
and then exploit them persistently.

Mr. Clifford asked whether CIA' 8 counterintelligence program has un
covered U. S. citizens serving as Soviet agents. Mr. Helms replied that one
such instance was the case of Sergeant. Rhodes (Mr. McCone interjected that
if there had not been a mixeup in signals, Dunlap would have been turned up
as an agent. Mr. Clifford said that the Board knew about that..)

Dr. Langer asked whether the FBI is more active now in its counter
espionage coverage in the United States Mr. Helms said that FBI is at a
maximum of activity: He added that the Able case had proved something that
CIA and FBI had doubted, foe., that the USSR was operating \"illegals\" in the
U S. after World War II
In answer to a question as to whether new policy guidance is needed
with respect to counterespionage activities, Mr. Helms stated that CIA does
not feel that NSCID No. 5 neede revision the problems that exist are
encountered in the implementation of the directive. There is a view in the

TOP SECRET

Intelligence community (supported by Army and Navy, although CIA and FBI
are not keen on it) that there is a need for a Counterintelligence Committee.
The objection to this is grounded on the nature of counterintelligence work
which involves highly sensitive operations aimed at penetration of foreign
government's intelligence services, and the security of these sensitive
operations would be weakened if several agencies shared in them. Underin
present arrangements there is no duplication of counterintelligence actions
on the part of the agencies involved because of the day-to-day liaison that
is maintained among them; and, also, the CIA maintains a central counter-
Intelligence index file for use by interested agencies. In addition, the
USIB provides a place for the resolution of policy questions Therefore,
Mr. Helms said, the CIA feels that the present bureaucratic apparatus i
sufficient for its purposes. He added that one improvement that is needed
is for U. S. military agencies to make good memoranda for the record con-
cerning contacts made by U. S S. military attaches with foreign officers
( In the Wennerst Vennerstrom case it has been found that no such records ds were were mai
tarned about the many contacts with Wennerstrom during the perica in which
it is now known that he was serving as a Soviet agent).

in-
Mr. Me MeCone next addressed himself to the subject t of Cuba, in which the
Poard had expressed an interest. He said that from 15,000 to 18,000
Military personnel have been withdrawn since the missile crisis. A few
hundred have arrived during the past month, and since October there appears
to have been a rotation replace ont of Soviet personnel in Cuba. It is
believed that the USSR is ma
including military advisers,
ing a large MAAG-type\" contingent in Cuba,
inicians, and personnel training the Cubans
in the operation of SAM sites ar KOMAR vessels. All missiles have been
removed from Cuba by the Soviets except cruise missiles, FROG missiles and

SAMS The Soviet decision to train Cubans and to relocate SAM sites
indicates an intention to turn them over to Cuban control eventually.
Further Soviet withdrawals will probably take place when Cubans become
proficient in the weapons systems So, in Cuba there is a transition from
Soviet military forces to a MAAG-type operation, with the Soviets retaining
control of only the most sophisticated weapons systems. Equipment with-
drawals have been limited to the missiles and launchers, and the replacement
of advanced SAM radars with older types of the kind supplied by the USSR
to Egypt and Indonesia.

In answer to Mr. Clifford's query about news accounts of CIA agent
operations in' Cuba, Mr. McCone said hat CIA has had a very active operation
against Cuba and the Board has been briefed on it from time to time. Although
there have been some disappointments and roll-ups of agents, CIA has vastly
improved it's agent nets and internal agent sources among legal travelers
and friendly foreign government missions in Cuba. Of the 17 agents reportedly
executed in Cuba, 7 were CIA's. One unfortunate experience was the identi-
fication of the S.S. Rex as a CIA support ship. (Mr. Helms said that the
story first came to public attention on October 21 when Cuban planes strafed
a bauxite ore vessel, thinking it was the mother ship which CIA was using.
to return an agent team from a desolate area in Western Cuba. The CIA
agent team had been in 6 weeks, had recruited additional agents, and was
scheduled to come out on October 21. The S. S Rex was lying off shore
and personnel were sent ashore in small boats to meet the agent team. The infri-
red blinker signals from shore were correctly given, although the light ights were
placed closer together than they should have been. A hailing signal was
given from a rubber boat and was acknowledged, but then machine gun fire
opened up on the small boats.) Mr. McCone stated that the cover story

JOD SECRET
for the S. S. Rex was a good one a hydrographic oil exploration vessel
and when the agent team was rolled up it was decided to bring the Rex back
to a Florida port as called for in the cover plan, rather than taking it
to some foreign port and thereby ruin the cover story.

Referring to the Dunlap case, Mr. Clifford said that the Board was
shocked to learn of the lack of coordination between NSA and ASA, and he
invited the DCI's comments on this in view of the Board's responsibility to
the President in this matter
Mr. McCone replied that his recommendation to the Secretary of Defense
is to overhaul the security system and to ensure that military personnel
assigned to NSA be subjected to the same kind of security screening as that
which NSA applies to its civilian personnel, 1.e., a background investigation
and polygraph examination. The DCI noted that. NSA rejects ?) per cent of the
military personnel who have been working as military assignees to NSA, when
they apply for civilian employment at NSA. Critics of Mr. McCone's proposal
say that any such new procedure would have to be applied among agencies
generally and that would present problems, but Mr. McCone feels that the
more stringent security clearance procedure should start at NSA which is the
heart of the problem, and then widen the circle to other agencies gradually.

The DCI said that he is also looking into the need-to-know by NSA with
respect to the large number of sensitive CLA documents which are used by
NSA Some 135,000 such documents were at NSA during Dunlap's employment there.
The DCI stated that CIA has not completed its damage assessment yet, and a
few weeks more would be required.

Mr. Gray asked whether the CIA investigates a military man assigned to
CIA in the event that derogatory information is developed concerning him.
Mr McCone replied that before a military assignes comes to CIA, the CIA

ELINT! For example in connection with aSoviet missile shot on Kamchatka
there was a suspicion that the test would include a Soviet anti-ICBM shot,
but our Alaskan radar site was not alerted, the radars were not up, and
we missed coverage of any anti-ICBM test. Mr. McCone agreed with Dr. Baker's.
observation that there is a relationship between the activities of the new
Center and the responsibilities to be assigned under the Defense ELINT Plan,
and the DCI added that there may well be resistance from some elements of
the military.

Next Mr. McCone reported to the Board on the recent. U-2 crash in the
Gulf of Mexico. The whole plane has been found in 9 fathoms of water 40
miles NW of Key West. The ejector canopy is off and the seat is out. An
empty life raft and parachute were found There was no attack made on the
aircraft. The pilot reported a successful mission over Cuba, he flew over
the Key West station on the return trip and 10 minutes later he was down.
When the wreckage is raised it should be possible to determine the cause.

Mr. McCone said that this exhausted the list of things he had in mind
to discuss at this meeting.

Mr. Clifford asked if there were any intelligence facets of the arrest
of U. S. professor Barghorn in the USSR. The DCI said that an analysis of
the professor's debriefing had not yet been completed. He had no intelligence
mission even indirectly, but was once a CIA consultant and the KGB knew that.
No doubt this Soviet move was made because they had run out of pawns to use.
in obtaining an exchange for the Soviet spy Egeroff arrested in the U. S.
As a matter of fact CIA had forecast that the Soviets would do something
like this when they ran out of people to use in exchanges, Mr. McCone said.

At 12:15 Mr. McCone brought in Mr. Colby who was in charge of the CIA
Station at Saigon for 5 years and more recently has been in charge of the

Far East desk at CIA headquarters. At an NSC meeting following the anti-
Diem coup in South Vietnam the President decided to send Mr. Colby to
Saigon to survey the situation as a representative of the President and of
the Secretaries of State and Defense. The Vietnam coup is the 8th that has
taken place around the world during the past year. Mr. McCone said that he
has looked back over CIA reporting on these events and found that without
exception there had been a forecast of what was to come an of the people
involved
Mr. McCone said that reports of possible coups in Vietnam had been
received for years. Up to early August it was CIA's practice to inform
the Diem government about reported coup plotting.. Then when Diem began to
resist efforts to get him to change some of his policies, CIA decided not to
report to him on coup talk which was noted in August, but CIA would watch the
situation which CIA did in detail through August and September. CIA
knew quite a lot about the General's coup plotting but not their precise
plan. General Dhin told CIA that the coup was ready. CIA maintained a radio
telephone link between the Joint General Staff and the CIA Station in Saigon,
so that the CIA contact could report developments. CIA did not have/and does
information on
not know about the assassinations of Diem and Như CIA had no part in
organizing the coup, Mr. McCone informed the Board, although some rave
accused CIA of this. Mr. McCone said he would now ask Mr. Colby to brief
the Board, noting that Mr. Colby attended the Honolulu meeting (as did
Mr. McCone) and is knowledgeable of the decisions made there. (At 12:25
Mr. McCone left the Board meeting to keep his appointment with Mr. Bundy.)

Mr. Colby began by informing the Board that CIA has for some time
been watching signs of instability in the Vietnam government, in order to

TOP SECRET

determine reasons for discontent and to learn of any plans to overthrow the
government. (Two earlier coups had been attempted. In November 1960
Junior paratrooper officers took part. In 1962 wo Air Force pilots bombed
the palace in the hope of killing members of the royal family.) In the
summer of 1963 CIA's policy was tied to clear and present danger to.U.S.
interests If CIA saw threats to the Diem regime, CIA would give warnings
to Diem so as not to spoil CIA's contacts with the regime. In the summer,.
the intense feelings over the Bhuddist issue were graver than any that CIA
had seen in Vietnam. There were major popular grievances against the regime.
The regime insisted it had the answers to all questions and that any
opposition was either venal or stupid. All was decided from the Palace, and
the Generals did not have much to do. The regime had a total lack of appre-
ciation of public relations both at home and internationally. While the
Bhuddist suicides by burning were taking place there were 6 or 8 potential
coup groups being formed, some of them being alliances between civilians änd
the military. The situation was crystallized with the Government raids on
pagodas, resulting in public outcry. Diem convinced his Generals that these
repressive actions were necessary to maintain the war effort, when in fact
Diem was making a political move against a Bhuddist political operation.
(Mr. Colby said there was no tie between the Bhuddists and the Vieg Cong,
although there had been some Communist penetration of the Bhuddist priests
dating back before 1954.) The anti-Diem Bhuddist movement actually began
as a concept to protect Bhuddism against Catholic supremacy. When the
Government raided the pagodas, this almost set off a coup attempt at that
time but the coup planners had not yet obtained support of sufficient troops.
Meanwhile, CIA was watching developments' carefully, Mr. Colby said. In
answer to a question from Mr. Coyne, he stated CIA funds and activities were

not directly or indirectly involved in support of Diem forces which raided
the pagodas.

Continuing, Mr. Colby reported to the Board that in September pandced
October CIA had identified (1) a General's coup group, and (2) a coup c
group headed by junior officers and civilians, which was alleset co move i
on October 24 but could not do so for lack of needed trucks... Mr. Colby
then went on to describe the Generals' coup action which resulted in the
overthrow of the Diem government, along the lines publicly reported.

In answer to Mr. Murphy's question, Mr. Colby informed. the Board that
there were 10 executions of members of the Diem regime during the coup
action.

Looking ahead, Mr. Colby stated that as soon as the Generals have
finished removing pro-Diem officials from the Government \"they will procced
to institute popular programs in an effort to solidify the support of the
people in the prosecution of the war effort (the strategic hamlet program will
probably be continued). The Generals will have to change the compartmentation
of the Vietnam military forces which Diem had established as a means of
preventing the Generals from knowledge of the overall situation. Accordingly
the new ruling Generals' group sees the need for thorough reorganization
of the military chain of command, and are attempting to form an organizational.
pattern which will be better suited to fighting the war against the Viet
Cong. The basic war concept is to clean out Cong forces in the southern
delta area and then expand military activities in the northern area.

General Doolittle asked whether there is any organized Communist
movement within South Vietnam. Mr. Colby replied that the Viet Cong guerilla

effort has penetrated into the South Vietnamese society. Viet Cong:
military units are guided by Cong Political Committees which are set up in
each Province. There is, Mr. Colby stated, a Communist Party in South
Vietnam whose main efforts are directed at \"shooting at us and propagandizing
the South Vietnamese into the belief that their real enemies are the U. S.
and the present Government of the country.

In answer to Mr. Pace's question as to whether realistic looks have:
been taken of the potentials for winning the war in Vietnam, Mr. Colby sai cả
that a hard nose look is necessary. It is not yet clear whether the new
Government regime can claim the support of the people in the countryside,
The situation is in fair shape in the northern two-thirds of the country;
but is bad in the southern one third.

Mr. Coyne inquired about U. S. coordination of its some fifteen 10,
Intelligence elements in South Vietnam. Mr. Colby said that the J-2 is
coordinating military intelligence activities, CIA coordinates political
intelligence efforts, and paramilitary matters are being turned over to
U. S. Special Forces. He said that there are 200 personnel engaged in the
CIA effort in South Vietnam.

Dr. Langer asked about the recall of the CIA Station Chief in Saigon
(Richardson) Mr. Colby said that Richardson had become publicly identified..
as a close contact of the Diem regime at a time when the U. S. Government
became critical of policies of the Diem regime.

As for French Government attitudes toward the South Vietnam situation,
Mr. Colby observed that the French have considerable commercial holdings.

piqued at their loss of a \"protective image\".

Mr. Colby concluded his discussion with the Board and left the meeting
at 1:00 p.m.

In executive session, the Board had a further discussion of its report
to be made to President Kennedy on the Dunlap case. Chairman Clifford
brought Messrs. Murphy and Pace up to date on the principal matters covered
at the preceding day's session of the Board meeting with regard to the ex-
tensive review and materials which had been completed thus far by Mr. Gray
and Mr. Coyne in the Dunlap case. Mr. Clifford summed up the Board's reaction
of being aghast at the shocking looseness of security attitude at the NSA.
He referred to the many questions which had been put to the Director of NSA
at yesterday's session. Mr. Clifford observed that General Fitch had made
a very intelligent presentation, and that an exceedingly valuable session
had been had with General Carroll of DIA. Mr. Clifford said that after
lunch the Board would complete its consideration of the Dunlap report and
recommendations which the Board Panel had drafted. Arrangements had not
been made for a meeting of Board members with President Kennedy in con-
junction with this particular Board meeting because Mr. Clifford had felt
that the Board would require all the time of this 2-day meeting to complete
action on its report on a complex subject.

Chairman Clifford said that Board members should plan to convene for
half a day at the next Board meeting and then meet with the President for
an hour on the Dunlap case report. In view of the serious nature of the
counterintelligence problems involved, Mr. Clifford expressed the opinion
that the Board's report and recommendations may well constitute one of the
most important contributions which the Board has made.

Mr. Clifford then informed Board members Murphy and Pace of the
Board's discussion yesterday assessing the degree of damage resulting
from Dunlap's ospionage activities. Recognizing the difficulty of arriving
at an assessment at this time, Mr. Clifford observed that the damage must
have been serious, and he noted that the CLA is still evaluating its practice
of sending its sensitive documents to the NSA. Mr. Clifford stated that
despite differences of opinion which may exist as to the damage done to
U. S. interests by Dunlap's espionage service for the Russians, the Board
has information which hears on the subject but which cannot be made generally
known and which the Board can pass on only to the President. (Mr. Clifford
then related to the Board the most sensitive item, consisting of information
which inad been given to Mr. Coyne by appropriate authority, for reporting
to the Board and to the President. It was agreed by Board members that the

SUBJECT: Meeting of the President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board - June 25-26, 1963
r
The Board convened in its offices at 297 Executive Office
Building, 9:00 A.M., June 25, 1963, on the first day of its
two-day meeting. Those present were Board Chairman Clark
Clifford and Members Gray, Langer, Murphy, Doolittle, Land,
Langer, and Pace; and Messrs. Coyne and Ash.

Chairman Clifford began the meeting with the observation
that the Board has been in existence for two years, and has
been very active during that time. \"Mr. Clifford thought
that it was exceedingly appropriate at this time to look
back on the two years! work of the Board, to evaluate the
work, and to arrive at conclusions concerning areas where
the Board can expand its usefulness to the President.
Accordingly, Mr. Clifford said, he has purposely kept to a
minimum the appearances of briefers from outside during this
meeting, and Board business would be confined mostly to con-
sideration of reports by the various Board Panels. On the
following day the Chairman indicated that he would set aside
time for a discussion of the usefulness of Panel reports
with a view to seeing whether there might not be increased
use made of Panels in pursuing the Board's functions.
this procedure proved useful, the Chairman thought that perhaps
there would be fewer formal meetings of the whole Board and
that the Panels could prepare proposed reports to the President
to be considered at formal meetings of the Board, thereby
avoiding a last-minute rush in the preparation of reports
to the President.
:
If
The Chairman then turned to a number of items which he
had drawn up for discussion with the Board, with the assistance.
of Mr. Coyne.

First, the Chairman read to Board members the letter
which had been written to Mr. Clifford on June 5 by Dr.
Killian, thanking the Board for the gift which he had received
on the occasion of his resignation as Chairman of the Board.

Turning to the Board-suggested item regarding the status of current
efforts to mount clandestine collection and covert operations against Cuba,
the DCI referred to the close attention being given to these matters
the Board that since March of this year Mr. Fitzgerald of CIA has been heading
up the Agency's headquarters element directly concerned with clandestine
activities against Cuba. Agents have been placed in Cuba for CIA by Argentina,
France, Spain, Holland, Denmark, Norway and Britain. A total of 104 new agents
of all types are in operation, 41 of them in Cuba where three \"black\", illegal
teams are working. As yet there have been no penetrations of the Castro regime
or military installations
CIA gets reports from these agents and liaison
observers but the Agency has \"no agents sitting on the Cuban General Staff\"
Mr. McCone said that we do not know how many Soviets are in Cuba, although
it can be estimated that there are 12,000 to 13,000 still there and possibly
more, all scattered over the island He informed the Board that pursuant to
approvals by the Special Group, the NSC and the President there are active
programs for intensified intelligence collection on Cuba, as well as efforts
to promote disaffection in the Cuban military; hampering the Cuban economy;
and sabotage.

Mr. Clifford asked for background on the recent news stories about
Cuban exiles claiming that invasion teams had been sent into Cuba. Mr. McCone
stated that these claims were national stories by Cuban exiles in Miami with
a view to obtaining U. S. military intervention.
The DCI added that CIA assessed
the development accurately the night that word was first received about it.
He went on to say that an approved U. S. program calls for a long term effort
over two years aimed at disaffecting the Cuban military from Castro, and it is

expected that this effort will result in press releases, and Soviet protests
at the UN and elsewhere. However, Mr. McCone expressed the belief that there
is already some disaffection within Cuban military circles, and if the CIA
effort succeeds the result will be an overthrow of Castro but it will also
mean a military dictatorship in Cuba for a time.

Mr. McCone suggested that it might be profitable for the Board to receive
a briefing on Cuban matters from Mr. Fitzgerald of CIA, at the next Board meeting,
Mr. Clifford agreed that this would be desirable
Mr. Gray observed that newspaper accounts and items in the Central
Intelligence Bulletin have been in disagreement on the Soviet turnover of the
armored camps to the Cubans. Mr. McCone thought that CIA's assessment is the
correct one..
:
Mr. Pace inquired about the quality of U-2 photography being obtained
from missions over Cuba. Mr. McCone replied that in the present season of
summer storms there is more cloud cover and shadows which means fewer sightings
of the 30 critical target points of top interest to the CIA, and he noted that
there was a 15-day period of such bad weather recently. At present U-2 missions
are flown daily and sometimes twice daily all of them direct overflights.
The objective, he said is to get a mosaic of the whole island every 7 days
In answer to General Doolittle's question, Mr. McCone said that special
authorization is still required for the sending of low-level missions over Cuba.
Answering a question by Dr. Langer, the DCI said that no evidence of camouflage
had been seen He added that each day CIA issues an analysis of \"exotic!\"
reporte received from refugee, agent and other sources
and there are innumerable
such reports of all kinds which cannot be checked out. For example, a refugee
from Cuba arrived in Miami with the story that he had seen an enormous submarine

base at a location near Banes. But an examination of photography of the
village in question shows only some fishing shacks and the presence of a shoal
which would prevent the entry of any vessels other than shallow draft fishing
boats.

Mr. Pace asked whether useful information had been obtained from CIA's
own recovered agents. Mr. McCone said yes, definitely.
Turning to the subject of OXCART, the DCI said that ten are on order,
ren have been delivered and six have been flown. The remaining three will be

sequent development of Air Force interceptor and reconnaissance versions of
OXCART.

As for the crash of the OXCART last month, the DCI reported the facts
substantially as previously given to the Board by General Doolittle. Mr. McCone
indicated that no security breach had occurred; when picked up by the persons
who came up in a jeep the pilot succeeded in steering them away from the crash
scene; the State Police secured the area; all pieces of the plane were removed
within 30 hours; the only news photos made were retrieved before the film was
processed or published; and only an innocuous news story appeared in the press.
Mr. McCone said that the Board of Inquiry found that false instrument readings
were caused by frozen pitot tubes. It appeared that there was some pilot error;
corrective recommendations have been made; and meanwhile OXCART will be flown
1
under conditions of clear visibility.

In answer to Mr. Pace's question, the DCI said that the overall cost of
project OXCART is $750 million (of which $300 million is engine cost), and that
project TAGBOARD will require an additional expenditure of $85 million.

(Dr. Baker departed the Board meeting at this point.)
Taking up the sixth item suggested by the Board for discussion, the DCI
said that he felt that there were no security implications in the Profumo case
in Britain. Mr. McCons said it was thought that it would be contrary to Soviet
procedure for Ivanov to attempt to use Keeler for espionage purposes, although
there might have been a Soviet attempt at political action against the MacMillan
1
government.
In answer to Mr. Coyne's question, Mr. McCone said that the British
had cooperated fully with CIA in regard to the Profumo case with respect to any
U. S. people involved, but that the British have rightfully withheld information
on the implication of other Britishers. Mr. McCone informed the Board that
within a couple of days the Labor Party in England will break the case involving
Philby who turns out to be the \"third man\" in the Burgess-MacLean case, and who
in the late 1940's was in liaison with the CIA and FBI. The DCI added that
MacMillan has been sitting on this case for a long time and CIA has tried in
the past to get the British to surface it.
Turning to the next item listed as of interest to the Board, Mr. McCone
said that the Penkovskiy espionage case in the USSR had no implications for

Perious loss of valuable source with the execution of this individual who pro-

Mr. McCone related that the Soviet Colonel had been recruited by CIA but the
British were brought in when it developed that contacts could best be made when
(
the Soviet officer was in London escorting visiting military and trade missions.
Therefore, Mr. McCone went on to say, CIA got MI-6 to share in the reporting
aspects and means were set up whereby information could be delivered by

Penkovskiy, (for example, dropping a roll of tinfoil wrapped microfilm into a
baby carriage pushed by the wife of n Britisher in a London park)。 The DCI
said that apparently the Soviet officer's cooperation was motivated by an
emotional resentment of the fact that he had been passed over in promotions.
According to Mr. McCone, the officer was probably uncovered as a result of
Soviet penetration of British intelligence, and it is known that he had no
access to CIA or FBI. Mr. Coyne asked whether CIA or Penkovskiy had initiated
the contact with CIA, and whether he could have been planted. Mr. licCone replied
that CIA was of course worried about the possibility of a plant but decided
that such was not the case。
C
Taking up the next item on the status of Board recommendations growing
out of the Hanson Baldwin article of July 1962, the DCI informed the Board
that the FBI completed its investigation but did not positively identify the
source of the leak and therefore dropped the matter. As to the proposal for
controls on press contacts, as a means of protecting intelligence matters, the
DCI said that State and Defense put in a system of control procedures which
set off the furor over \"management of the news which is still raging. State
finally dropped its system; the Defense Department retained its procedures; and
CIA already was following a control system and still does. With regard to the
Board's proposal of a special investigative group to investigate unauthorized
disclosures, Mr. McCone said that he suggested this to State and Defense but
the \"managed news\" furor was at its height so nothing was heard from those
departments about the proposal。
Meanwhile unknown to anyone outside CIA, the
Agency's Office of Security is developing a mechanism to cover any serious leaks
occuring in the security field should the President request action.

The Board met at 9:00 a.m., April 23, 1963, in the Board's
offices, Room 297, Executive Office Building, at the call of the
Chairman, Dr. Killian. Present were Board members Doolittle,
Murphy, Clifford, Gray, Baker, Pace, Langer and Land, and Messrs.
Coyne and Ash.

Dr. Killian opened the meeting with the observation that when
the DCI joined the Board meeting later in the day, Board members
should be prepared to discuss with Mr. McCone the latter's April 15,
1963, submission to the President of comments in response to the
14 recommendations made in the Board's March 8 report on Cuba.

The Chairman asked Mr. Coyne to give the Board a brief oral
summary of the DCI's April 15 submission to the President. Mr. Coyne
did so by repeating for the information of the Board members the
comment's which he had provided to Mr. Bundy in a memorandum dated
April 22, 1963, in response to Mr. Bundy's request that he be
furnished Mr. Coyne's own reaction (not that of the Board) to the
DCI's communication to the President.

Having heard Mr. Coyne's resume of his comments to Mr. Bundy
on the DCI's report, Dr. Killian thought that the comments were
sound and well presented, although Dr. Killian was of the view that

Briefly referring to his visit to the NPIC quarters at the Naval Gun Factory,
General Doolittle noted that the facility has considerable room for expansion and
the activity is being carried on there under greatly improved conditions. The
Department of Defense personnel contingent which is housed at the facility operates
as a self-contained unit. Mr. Lundahl, Director of the NPIC, reports that although
the facility does not possess sufficient manpower to handle a double load which might
be imposed should two emergency situations occur simultaneously, he nevertheless
feels that the space and equipment expansion now under way at the new quarters would
accommodate the additional personnel who would be required in such a situation.

At the Chairman's request, Mr. Murray briefly informed the Board concerning
the meeting which he and Mr. Gray and Mr. Coyne had recently with Mr. Cord Meyer
of CIA on the subject of covert action programs. Mr. Murphy pointed out that
Mr. Meyer's briefing covered operations in Latin American countries, but the subject
of Cuba was excluded inasmuch as that subject was to be covered at today's Board
meeting. Mr. Murphy said the briefing consisted primarily of light touches in-
cluding information on the China frontier situation. Nothing new was brought up
with respect to Europe or the Middle East, Mr. Murphy said. The CLA briefing
reflected the existence of positive evidence that the entourage of the Brazilian
President Goulart is communist-penetrated. Mr. Murphy observed that this briefing
had been presented by CIA at the request of Mr. Murphy and Mr. Gray, and it was
Mr. Murphy's impression that the briefing was rather routine in nature, and therefore
seemed to downgrade the importance which the Board attaches to the subject of covert
action operations and requirements.

Dr. Land observed that from his experience, every time that secrecy is used
as a cloak for an assumed efficient but sensitive operation, one may well later
fire on removal of the cloak that there was nothing there. Dr. Land thought that

it is up to the Board to ascertain specifically whether the President desires that
the Board go into covert action programis deeply, and if that is the Fresident's
wish then the Board should take steps to insure that it receives full and significant
briefings from the agencies concerned. In this connection Mr. Clifford asked
whether there was any limitation at all on the Board's right to know about these
matters Dr. Killian replied that there were no limitations and that this is well
established.

Mr. Coyne informed the Board at this point about the telephone call which had
been received from the Office of the DCI the preceding day, Mr. Kirkpatrick of
CIA had conveyed the DCI's wish that the scheduled CIA briefing of the Board today
on certain clandestine operations be conducted in the absence of Mr. Cottrell,
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Bureau of Inter-American Affairs, who Mr. McCone
understood was to join the Board meeting at the same time the CIA briefing was to
be given. The basis for the DCI's request was the fact that certain aspects of the
CIA briefing to be given on clandestine operations with respect to Cuba involve
covert action operations which Mr. Cottrell is not privy to. Mr. Coyne noted that
the Boed's agenda had been revised to accommodate the DCI's request, although
Mr. Coyne found the request to be somewhat surprising in view of the responsibilities
which have been assigned to Mr. Cottrell by the White House for coordination for
all matters relating to Cuba.

Mr. Gray observed that if at today's meeting the Board in fact received a
full story concerning clandestine and covert actions being planned and executed
under CIA auspices, this would certainly constitute a milestone in the Board's
efforts along this line. Dr. Land thought the Board should take the position that
unless the CIA briefing presents a full story, the briefers should be asked to
continue until the Board has received a full picture: Mr. Clifford thought that
the better procedure to follow would be for the Board to listen to the CIA briefing

and to ask any questions which it may have during the course of the briefing, and
if the Board still has unanswered questions at the conclusion of the briefing
they should be compiled by the Board staff for discussion at the next meeting of
the Board and pursued further with the DCI. The Board agreed with Mr. Clifford's
suggestion. Mr. Murphy added that the Board should endeavor to ascertain the
context of any over-all plan which the government has with respect to Cuba and under
which the intelligence community is operating. Dr. Killian emphasized the desira-
bility that on the occasion of the CIA briefing today, pertinent questions regarding
Cuba should be pressed with the briefers. Mr. Clifford observed that if the Board
does not receive sufficient information from CIA in these matters, it might be well
to consider the alternative of the Board preparing itself for the conduct of a
searching examination of appropriate CIA representatives who are knowledgeable
in this area, and have a stenographic record prepared of the proceedings.

At 10:15 a.m., the Director of Central Intelligence, Mr. McCone,
Joined the Board meeting, accompanied by Mesers. Kirkpatrick,
Fitzgerald and Clark. Referring to events of the past twenty-four
hours, the DCI expressed satisfaction that the U.S./Cuba prisoner
exchange had included the return to the U.S. of the 3 senior CIA
personnel who had been imprisoned in Cuba early in the Castro regime
when they were caught in the act of bugging the Chinese Communist
mission in Cuba. Mr. McCone said that the exchange which the attorney
Donovan had worked out with Castro called for the release of 22
Americans in exchange for the return to Cuba of Molina (Castro body-
guard) who was in the custudy of New York authorities following the
slaying of an Argentine girl in a night club, and the 3 Cubans who
were under Federal indictment in New York on sabotage charges. The

DCI said that he personally negotiated with Governor Rockefeller
the release of Molina, and that the Attorney General handled the

In answer to a questior from Mr. Murphy, the DCI stated that
the terms of the exchange agreement were not of a nature to affect the
conduct of present or future U.S. intelligence and covert action oper-
ations with respect to Cuba. Mr. McCone added that Castro did not
seek any conditions other than the release of the 4 Cubans being held
in the U.S. Mr. McCone thought it interesting that Castro had pressed
for no conditions involving U.S. policy towaii Cuba, and had sought
no assurances regarding U.S. aerial surveillance, espionage operations,
military policy, or anything else. Vallejo, Castro's assistant, told

attorney Donovan to tell President Kennedy and Mr. Mic Cone that
Castro realizes that he must gain a rapprochment with the U.S.,
and Mr. Mc Cone expressed the belief that in agreeing to the recent
prisoner exchange Castro is seeking to retain a thread of contact
with the U.S. as insurance in the event of a double-cross by the
USSR. The DCI had no idea why he had been included in the message
to be delivered by Donovan.

Mr. McCone pointed out that the attorney Donovan has
become our only direct channel to Castro. However, Donovan has
announced that his mission is ended and that with the completion
of the recent exchange he had gone into Cuba for the last time (for
one thing Donovan had to make the announcement to head off continued
appeals by Cuban exiles in the U.S. to help obtain the release of
numerous relatives still remaining in Cuban prisons). Therefore,
Mr. Me.Cone noted, if any future us. is to be made of Donovan's entree
to Castro, it would undoubtedly have to be on some basis other than
prisoner releases.

Messrs. Kirkpatrick and Fitzgerald noted that apparently the
Castro regime had not succeeded in connecting the 3 CIA personnel
to employment with CIA.

Next, Mr. McCone turned to several matters which he wished to
mention to the Board.

In the coordination field, the DCI informed the Board that the
new NRO agreement is now in effect and working well. Plans and
arrangements for the DIA's use of the NPIC are progressing. In the

Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald of CIA (DD/P Area) exhibited a chart reflecting the
following information concerning clandestine agents in Cuba as of April 1, 1953,
and the intelligence rèports which they had produced during the 12-month period
ending April 1, 1963:

82 resident agents 665 reports
2. illegal teams. 77 reports.
29 legal travelers 67 reports.
46 shipboard agents 39 reports
26 penetrations of Cuban installations. 192 reports.

In answer to questions raised by Board members, Mr. Fitzgerald elaborated
upon the statistics displayed on the chart which he exhibited to the Board.

The \"resident agents\" are not third-country diplomats but are Cubans. As:
of March 1, 1962, there were 50 such agents in Cuba. Thereafter, 480 individuals
Of the number which were recruited,
were considered for possible use in this category.
34 resident agents in Cuba have been lost (one is known to have been executed,
27 are unaccounted for, 4 escaped after arrest). As of April 1, 1963 the total
number of resident agents in Cuba is 82 as indicated previously by Mr. Fitzgerald

With reference to the \"illegal teams\" of which there are 2 in Cuba,
Mr. Fitzgerald stated that the teams consist of 2 men cach, but that as many as 100
sub-agents have been developed by the teams The recruitment and operation of the
2 teams are in the \"black\", the teams were introduced by sea and their mission.
is primarily intelligence gathering A principal intelligence mission is the
obtaining of information concerning military aspects of the Soviet presence in
Cuba. Also, Mr. Fitzgerald stated, the illegal teams are designed to create resistance
networks among the Cuban population if possible, but the policy is not to pursue large-
scale, dangerous activity of this sort. For the most part reports are received from
members of the illegal teams in the form of secret writing messages dispatched

that efforts are being made to equip the team members ith it additional radios (they
have 4 agent-type radios now); and it is hoped that the team members will soon be
equipped with radio units which are small in size (the transmitter and receiver
together about the size of 2 cigarette cartons) and capable of medium speed trans-
missions for spans of only 60 seconds. Mr. Fitzgerald further informed the Board
that there were 4 illegal agents in Cuba as of March 1, 1962, and in the 12-month
period ending April 1, 1963, 45 agents were infiltrated, 32 were ex-filtrated, and
13 were lost, and as of April 1, 1963 there are in Cuba 14 agents comprising the
2 illegal agent teams.

With reference to the shipboard agents, Mr. Fitzgerald said that these
agents are or board Cuban ships, of which there are only 19 operating outside
of Cubarwaters. With regard to penetrations of Cuban installations previously
referred to, Mr. Fitzgerald stated that these involve Cuban diplomats and Cuban
diplomatic installations abroad. He added that some 14 Cuban diplomats are
providing information and 2 of these have furnished reports which are considered
to be good. In answer to Mr. Murphy's question, Mr. Fitzgerald said that the
only penetration of Castro's immediate entourage has been through Castro's
younger sister. He added that the penetrations referred to included 12 of an
audio aurveillance, nature Referring again to the 665 intelligence reporte
which have been obtained from resident agents in Cuba, Mr. Fitzgerald said that

In answer to a question by Mr. Murphy, Mr. Fitzgerald said that the intelli-
gence teams mostly confined their activities to intelligence gathering rather than
covert action, although the teams do have the mission of creating low-key iresistance
and subtle sabotage\". Mr. Fitzgerald said that although CLưc has no policy guidance
for positive covert action programs of a specific sabotage nature, there is policy
guidance for leaflet drops and radio propaganda, and an example of \"subtle sabotage
would be the shorting out of a high tension power line by throwing a copper wire
over it.

CIA for infiltrations of illegal agents into Cuba, and thereafter the success of

inquired as to the function of Mr. Cottrell's Interdepartmental Coordinating
Committee with respect to Cuba. In response to this question, Mr. Cottrell
described his coordinating function, beginning with the point that the President
had requested last January that coordination be supplied to the activities of the
6 or 7 U. S. agencies which were dealing with the 14 or 5 Cuban exile groups. The
President directed that there be established a focal point for coordination of
policy recommendations and execution of approved policies assigned for implementation
by various U. S. agencies following decisions by the Executive Committee of the NSC
with respect to Cuba Having been given this coordinating responsibility, Mr. Cottrell
named Secretary of the Army Vance and Mr. Helms of CIA to serve on the committee,
with provision for drawing upon representatives of other agencies as might be re-
quired from time to time. Mr. Cottrell said that his committee is charged with
coordinating policy with respect to Cuba, the objectives being to prevent Cuba from
becoming a base of Soviet aggression, to prevent the overt export of military equip-
ment from Cuba to other Latin American countries for communist purposes, to prevent
the export of subversivé activities to other Latin American countries from Cuba and
to seek the removal of the Soviet presence in Cuba. Mr. Cottrell went on to say that
when CIA proposes covert actions with respect to Cuba, the Cottrell Committee
considers the proposals and comments on them to the Special Group, and if a policy
issue is involved in a given proposal the matter is referred to the Executive
Committee of the NSC for decision

Mr. Murphy asked Mr. Cottrell if he would state for the Board Mr. Cottrell's
concept of what U. S. policy toward Cuba is today, for instance whether the policy
is of a defensive or an offensive character Mr. Cottrell answered by saying that
in his opinion that the U. S. policy toward Cuba is not defensive, and as an
indication of this he referred to the visit which he and Deputy Attorney General
Katzenbach made to Nicareuga where a conference was held with officials of Central
American countries concerning visa and other travel controls which might be

improved or instituted for the purpose of restricting the travel of Castro's.
representatives in Latin American countries. In further describing the U. S.
policy, Mr. Cottrell said that in his own view our government at does not intend to
invade Cuba except as a last resort, and our policy holds that tue: Liberation of
Cuba is the responsibility of the Cuban people themselves. However, Mr. Cottrell
added, it is felt by a number of people that the time has long past when we might
expect a successful popular uprising in Cuba against the Castro regime.

Mr. Gray asked whether the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Cuba would alter
the point of view just mentioned by Mr. Cottrell to the effect that we cannot hope
for a successful popular uprising in Cuba. Mr. Cottrell preferred that this question
be answered by Mr. Fitzgerald who expressed the opinion that withdrawal of Soviet
forces would not significantly affect the situation because of the strong internal
security measures which are maintained by the Castro regime in Cuba

Referring again to Mr. Fitzgerald's earlier statement that CIA is lacking in
policy guidance on covert actions, Mr. Coyne inquired as to whether requests
for such guidance had been made. Mr. Fitzgerald replied that a decision in this
area is being sought this week. Mr. Cottrell observed that previously the government's
prime objective had been to obtain the release of the 22 Americans imprisoned in
Cuba, and now that this has been accomplished, Mr. Cottrell predicted that future.
operations would include low-level reconnaissance missions, increased sabotage
operations, and intensified efforts to obtain OAS action. He added that inasmuch.
as the \"noise level\" is down it is hoped that aggressive programs may now be pursued.
Mr. Cottrell also said that he believes the time has come to begin creating tensions
in the Cuban area, and he noted that critics of the Administration have been charging
that our government has fallen into a co-existence policy with respect to Cuba
In Mr. Cottrell's opinion Castro must feel that his recent release of the
American prisoners will aid rapprochment efforts with respect to the U. S. and
Castro probably hopes that he may now quietly go on building up his communist

strength.

Next Mr. Bruce Clark of CIA (the DD/I Area) briefed the Board with respect
to certain aspects of intelligence coverage of Cuba
Mr. Clark stated that during the period February 15 to April 20, 1963 the
CIA believes that most
Soviets have removed approximately 4,700 personnel from Cuba.
of the 4,700 Soviet personnel were military people because of their age and appearance
and because there is little likelihood that the Soviets would be removing economic
personnel from Cuba. CIA estimates that only 500 or 600 Soviets have arrived during
this period, and CIA reasons that the 4,700 Soviets who have been withdrawn are
military personnel who have completed tours of duty, including some entire logistic
units. CIA estimates that this leaves in. Cuba Soviet personnel totaling on the
order of \"12,000 plus\". Mr. Clark said that the validity of the lauter figure
depends on the validity of the original estimated total of 17,500 Soviet personnel
in Cuba, a figure which was arrived at on a strict table of organization basis,
taking into account the estimated number of persons logically required to operate
the equipment which has been observed in Cuba. In the opinion of Mr. Clark, the
estimated fiture of 4,700 Soviet withdrawals is far sounder than the previous
estimate of 17,500 total personnel in Cuba.

Dr. Killian asked whether there is evidence of re-introduction of Soviet
military personnel into Cuba and their deployment and concealment by means of
camouflage. Mr. Clark said that in view of the redundency of the high altitude
coverage and the fact that nothing has been seen in photography since November 1962,
evidence is to the contrary
In answer to Mr. Murphy's question as to what Soviet personnel are presently
doing in Cuba, Mr. Clark estimated that 7,500 are connected with SAM installations
and activity, another 7,500 are in the category of military engineers, and 2,000
are engaged in naval operations. Mr. Clark indicated that Soviet personnel are

scattered out over the island of Cuba and the greatest concentrations are the
2,500 to 4,000 Soviet personnel in the 4 major Soviet armored camps. In answer
to Dr. Langer's question as to what the 2,500 to 4,000 personnel are doing, Mr
Clark stated that their main mission was probably the furnishing of training
to Cuban military forces. Mr. Clark said that COMINT obtained this week confirms
reports that Cuban pilots are receiving training in MIG-21's.

Noting that Mr. Fitzgerald had stated that CIA had 4 agents in Cuba in 1962
and now has 4 agents in Cuba in 1963, Mr. Clifford wondered whether efforts are
being made through other Latin American countries to infiltrate clandestine agents
in Cuba. Mr. Fitzgerald said that efforts are being made to develop agents from
other Latin American countries to operate in Cuba. He added that while Mr. Clifford's
recollection was correct concerning the constant figure of \"illegal\" agents in Cuba
as of a year ago and at the present time, nevertheless there are approximately
87 \"resident\" agents in Cuba who are engaged in clandestine intelligence collection.

Messrs'. Cottrell, Kirkpatrick, Fitzgerald and Clark departed the Board
meeting at this point.

At 12:00 noon, the Board meeting was joined by General Carroll, the
Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and by General Quinn and Colonel
Cillis, members of General Carrol's staff.

General Carroll recalled that at a Board meeting last year he had discussed
the status of the organization of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the responsi-
bilities which had been assigned to DLA or were being considered for assignment to

With respect to SIGINT collection on Cuba, General Blake informed the Board
that in March 1961 there were 10 NSA intercept positions and 5 processing staff
personnel working on Cuba, which was increased by February 1963 to 100 positions
and. 1,660 people. Mr. Clifford inquired as to whether any SIGINT which was obtained
on Cuba entered into U.. S. policy decisions during the October 1962 Cuba crisis
General Blake said that the policy makers were supplied with SIGINT on Soviet shipping

to Cuba as early as the spring and early summer of 1962. Dr. Tordella added that
also in the early summer of 1962 NSA was able to report on the SIGINT, buildup of
the Soviets in Cuba, and was able to provide information on defense communications
networks as well as the plain text of communications sent by the Soviet Ambassador
to his superiors in Moscow.

m
Mr. Murphy, inquired as to whether NSA now has an ability to penetrate Soviet
communications to Cuba. Dr. Tordella stated that in spite of the short distance
which separates Cuba from the U.. S. the security precautions followed by the Soviets
would not permit a hit-and-run commando type effort to pre-empt the communications
equipment involved. General Blake had no suggestions to offer in response to
Mr. Coyne's inquiry as to whether the NEA would like to extend its operations with
respect to Cuba beyond those which are now programmed.
General Blake did refer
to efforts which are being made, through direction finding methods, to pin-point
the location of the Soviet communications equipment in question, hopefully within
the range of 1 mile

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

THE WHITE HOUSE
WASHINGTON

SUBJECT: August 6-7, 1964, Meeting of the
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board

August 6, 1964

The first day of this scheduled 2-day meeting of the Board was devoted
to an all-day visit at SAC Headquarters, Offutt AFB, Omaha, Nebraska, on
August 6. In attendance were Messrs. Clifford, Doolittle, Langer, Pace, Gray,
Land, and Coyne. Board members Murphy and Baker were unable to join the
meeting at SAC.

August 7, 1964

On the second day of its meeting the Board convened at 9:00 a.m. on
August 7 at the Board's offices in the Executive Office Building, Washington,
D. C. Present were Messrs. Clifford, Doolittle, Murphy, Langer, Pace, Baker
and Gray; and Messrs. Coyne and Ash. (Board member Land joined the meeting
a little later on.)

Chairman Clifford commented on the valuable experience gained by the
Board in the course of its visit to SAC headquarters the previous day,
during which the Board had an opportunity to examine some fundamental
intelligence problems confronting the U. S. and the USAF. Mr. Clifford
mentioned the usefulness of the Board getting out of the atmosphere of \"theory\"
in Washington, in order to view intelligence activities and problems on the
scene. He thought that the Board's visit to SAC might well lead to action
on the part of the Board with respect to some of the matters examined and
discussed at Omaha.

Mr. Clifford pointed out that events of the last few days in the Gulf
of Tonkin had necessitated some last minute changes in the agenda of the
Board's meeting, and that particular attention would today be devoted to
intelligence aspects of the Vietnam situation.

The Chairman informed Boardmbers that Presidential action on the
Board's May 2 report and recommendations concerning the National Reconnaissance
Program awaits the outcome of pending considerations and discussions between
Mr. McGeorge Bundy, Secretary of Defense McNamara, and the Director of Central
Intelligence, Mr. McCone. Mr. Bundy, who has been following the McNamara-
McCone discussions in the hope of seeing those officials reach agreement on
the organization and management of NRP activities, recently asked Chairman
Clifford if the Board could take part in these discussions with a view to
facilitating agreement on the part of the Secretary of Defense and the DCI.
Mr. Clifford, speaking for the Board, told Mr. Bundy that the Board felt that

Handle via BYEMAN
Control System
DocId:34671882 Page 7

increase is expected over the next 5- 6 years (except for new reconnaissance
systems for which CIA might become responsible).

Mr. Gray asked for the DCI's views on the capability' of the intelligence
estimating mechanism to avoid being influenced by the wishful thinking of
responsible officials, as in the case of the erroneous estimate on Cuba prior
to the Soviet missile crisis in 1962. Mr. McCone said that a better example.
than Cuba was the estimate on Brazil which was bitterly resisted by people
in Government who nevertheless later saw the accuracy of the estimate proved
by developments.

Chairman Clifford observed that at SAC headquarters the day before,
SAC representatives suggested that they should have representation on COMOR
in US IB. The DCI said that the AF already has a representative on COMOR,
and if SAC were specifically added then a similar request would be made by
other commands such as NORAD and CINCEUR. Mr. Coyne observed that the
representation desired by SAC was on behalf of the SAC Commander in his role
on the Joint Strategic Planning Group.

In response to Mr. Murphy's query about Cuba, the DCI said that an
estimated 5,000 Soviets had departed since May 1, leaving 2,000 on the island.
The Cubans now have control of air defense and coastal defense but the question
is whether they have unlimited control of the SAM sites.

Chairman Clifford turned to another subject, asking for any new views
the DCI might have on the desirability of creating the position of \"Chief.
U. S. Intelligence Officer\" who would be divorced from direction of the CIA..
Mr. McCone said he had thought a lot about it but does not believe that such
an official could be effective if not linked to the CIA which by law has the
responsibility for coordinating all intelligence from all sources.

Mr. Pace expressed the opinion that it is not possible for the head of
CIA to render abstract opinions in the capacity of DCI. Mr. Clifford urged
the DCI to help the Board explore the possibilities of new organizational
approaches to this problem, now that 17 years have passed since the CIA was
established under the National Security Act. Mr. McCone said that he sees
the problem as having arisen because CIA has become a member agency of the
intelligence community as well as being charged by law to serve as coordinator
of all intelligence; and perhaps we are not managing properly the arrangement
that presently exists.

Mr. McCone agreed to have a study made of the matter raised by the
Chairman, as soon as possible.

Mr. McCone and Mr. Kirkpatrick departed, the meeting at 5:10 p.m.

At 5:20 p.m. the Board adjourned, closing its 2-day meeting.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE BOARD

SUBJECT: Audiosurveillance Collection and Countermeasures
Efforts of the Intelligence Community

In Executive Session Mr. Ash will brief the Board on:
significant developments relating to the subject which
members may wish to keep in mind when USIB representatives
discuss the matter with the Board.

Following Mr. Ash's briefing, Mr. Tom Karamessines,
Assistant to CIA's Deputy Director for Plans, and Mr.
Robert Bannerman of CIA's Deputy Directorate for Support,
will brief the Board on the U. S. Intelligence Board's
conclusions and recommendations on the organization and
management of the audiosurveillance-effort. (On June 26,
1964 following the Board's recommendations to the President,
Mr. Bundy requested the Director of Central Intelligence,
as Chairman of the USIB, to present coordinated proposals
for the most effective possible organization, management,
and coordination of the intelligence community's resources
and capabilities for research and development, and the
operational application, of techniques for audiosurveillance
collection and audiosurveillance countermeasures. The
organization and management aspects of this problem are
indicated by the fact that under present arrangements:
(1) research and development of audiosurveillance collection
and countermeasure devices and techniques are pursued
separately by State, Defense and CIA; (2) the coordination
of audiosurveillance collection operations is the responsibility
of the FBI in the U. 3., and is the responsibility of the DCI
overseas; and (3) the coordination of audiosurveillance
countermeasures activities is the responsibility of an NSC
Interagency committee chaired by the Department of State.)

Next Mr. Howard Osborne, Director of CIA's Office of
Security, and Mr. G.Marvin Gentile, Director of Security
at the Department of State, will bring the Board up to date
on the USIB's final assessment of the audio and electromagnetic
penetrations of the U. S. Embassy, Moscow which were discovered
in April.

(At the last meeting the Board was provided with results
of USIB's preliminary assessment of damage caused by these

penetrations. Subsequent to the last meeting the President
requested the Chairman, USIB, to provide a final assessment
of damage in time for consideration by the Board at its
August 6-7 meeting.)

Addendum: Enclosed for the information of the Board is a
memorandum entitled \"Bugging of the U. S. Embassy, Moscow\"
which was submitted to the Chairman by Dr. Jerome Wiesner,
following his oral presentation to the Board subsequent
to his on-the-scene examination of developments at the
Embassy in Moscow.

THE WHITE HOUSE
WASHINGTON

June 24, 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Clark M. Clifford
Chairman, President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board
SUBJECT: Bugging of the U. S. Embassy, Moscow

During my recent trip to Moscow I visited the American
Embassy and had a number of conversations with Mr. Musser
who has the responsibility for assuring that the building
is secure against listening devices. I also examined a
number of key offices in the Embassy building, including
several in which microphones had been found, and examined
the special secure rooms that have recently been installed.
I formed the following judgments regarding the present
situation.

1. There is no convincing basis for concluding that
additional listening systems do not exist in the building.

2. The soundproof rooms and the special room contain-
ing the teletype equipment appear to be secure, though the
former are not electrically shielded. The lack of shielding
is probably not serious because the rooms are in the interior
of the building and under guard at all times so that the use
of microphones or of electromagnetic listening devices in
them would be extremely difficult.

3. The physical security of the building seemed a
bit less than adequate. For example, it was possible for
us to go in and out of the room housing the telephone switch-
board with no one but the telephone operator--who I believe
was a Russian girl--seeing us. I understand that at night
no one is in the room. Physical security is complicated
somewhat by the fact that the building is also the residence
for Embassy employees and by the fact that the local guard
staff is very small; none the less this is a problem that
should receive attention.

4. Mr. Musser is extremely competent but the task at
the Embassy is more than any one person could handle at
this time
I would recommend the following measures:

1. Provide Musser with some assistance He has had
some help from the American forces in Germany from time to
DocId:34671882 Page 11

time but when I was there he was working by himself. Because
of the housing shortage the Embassy is reluctant to add to the
staff. The fact is, as I have already said, in spite of
Musser's outstanding ability he cannot do the job that now
must be done without substantial continuing assistance. He
also needs additional equipment.

2. A very complete physical examination must be made of
any room that is to be used for confidential conversations.
This should include x-ray or neutron examination of the walls,
floors and ceilings if possible. Possibly other techniques
can be found which would also help locate hidden equipment.

3. If x-ray examination is not feasible, physical
examination of the outside of the building should be considered.

4. In critical areas new wall surfaces should be provided.
Expert advice is needed to determine whether plastering or
paneling would provide the best protection.

5. Dr. Land's proposal for inducing masking sounds into
the walls should be pursued. It should be possible to introduce
such sounds directly into the walls without creating objectionable
sound levels in the rooms. This should be investigated before
a decision is made regarding new wall covering.

6. Screening should be provided against electromagnetic-
reflection listening devices.

7. The possibility of providing continuous monitors for
signals from such devices should be investigated.

8. More effort should be made to understand the purpose
of the microwave signal directed at the Embassy, or failing in
this, to stop it. It is hard to understand why we have been
so unconcerned about it.

9. An effort should be made to insure that the telephone
system cannot be used as a distribution system for listening
devices.

10. I understand that head sets and microphones exist
that permit secure conversations. Though they may be awkward
they should be used for confidential discussions held outside
of the secure rooms until greater confidence can be established
in the security of the building.

11. I believe that there is a desperate need for a
DocId:34671882 Page 12

professional group in the government to develop protective
techniques for our embassies. Such a group should work with
or at least have full access to a group whose task is to
develop sophisticated penetration devices so that its work
is effectively directed against all of the real threats that
can be imagined.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE
SUBJECT: Board Meeting of December 27 - 28, 1962

The Eoard convened at 9:00 a.m. on December 27. * Those
present were Dr. Killian, Chairman, Board members Langer, Murphy,
Gray, Doolittle, Pace and Clifford and Messrs. Coyne and Ash.

Dr. Killian suggested that Board members read the draft
report which had been furnished to the Board on the preceding
day by Mr. McCone, the Director of Central Intelligence, setting
forth the results of the all-source review which the Board had
requested concerning U. S. intelligence community activities with
respect to the Soviet military buildup in Cuba during the 6-months
preceding October 22, 1962. The Chairman asked that Board members
make note of any comments and questions they might wish to raise
for discussion during this two-day meeting. Dr. Killian said that
he was not sure the DCI's report had the approval of the intelli
gence community at this point, for he understood that Mr. McCone
was at that moment reviewing the draft report in Seattle, and it
was possible that some of the conclusions and factual details
might not have yet received final approval by the agencies which
contributed to the preparation of the report (CIA, DIA, State and
NSA). Accordingly, the Chaimman noted the importance of the
discussions which the Board would have on the following day with
heads of the intelligence agencies. The Chairman also thought
that the Board should alm for the preparation of a Board report
to the President at the close of this 2-day meeting.

Dr. Killian said that he had very recently talked to Mr.
McGeorge Bundy who hopes that the Board will take the time it needs
to produce a solid report on the handling given by U. S. intelli-
gence agencies to the Soviet military buildup in Cuba. Mr. Bundy
assured that the President will understand that the Board is going
into the subject deeply and objectively. About 10 days ago, the
Chairman related, he had received a telephone call from Mr. Bundy
who said that he had seen an early draft of the DCI's report (from
a confidential source) and was concerned because the report did not
get to the basic issues, and Mr. Bundy expressed an intention to
talk to Mr. McCone about this. Dr. Killian stated that he had an
appointment to see Mr. Bundy later in the morning at which time he
would ask Mr. Bundy to meet with the Board during the course of
this meeting
Board members Baker and Land were unable to attend.

24-day stay in Cuba, and our Government is ec is equally in the dark
about Soviet and Cuban plans for further activities \"involving
other countries in this Hemisphere. Also we are lacking intel
ligence on Cuba/Communist China discussions. Mr. Murphy reiterated
his concern that our lack of information on such matters as these
indicates the absence of an adequate intelligence capability to
keep our Government informed about developments in Cuba at the pre-
sent time and in the future.

Dr. Killian at this point reported to the Board on the con-
versation which he had just had with Mr. Bundy. According to
Mr. Bundy, the President is fully aware that the Board is con-
ducting its review of the Cuba situation. The President wants
an objective report from a group of citizens who have no axe to
grind, and he is placing great store on this effort of the Board
The Chairman said that Mr. Bundy was obviously concerned about
the prospect that the Congress will make inquiries into the Cuba
matter. However, Mr. Bundy feels there is a bare possibility that
Congressional investigators will be more hesitant to raise hypo
thetical questions if they learn of the existence of a study having
been made by a group such as the Board. It is Mr. Bundy's hope
that the Board will carefully consider the preparation of a sani-
tized version of the report, but if the Board and the President feel
that this cannot be done then the Board should try to prepare a
report which could be used in executive session of a Committee of
the Congress.

Dr. Killian went on to report other matters which had been
covered in his discussion with Mr. Bundy. He said that Mr. Bundy
had expressed concern Cover the failure of the 'DCI to accept the
suggestion that there be submitted a more adequate report than the
one which the DCI forwarded to the Board on December 26. Mr. Bundy
noted in this connection that the DCI's report assigns to policy
makers prime responsibility for any failures with respect to
intelligence handling.

On the question of availability of Special Group records for
purposes of the Board's study, Mr. Bundy informed the Chairman
that certainly the Board should examine such records and that
they could be obtained from Mr. Parrott (Mr. (Mr. Bundy commented thatv
the Board is the only group which can have this kind of access)

As to the Board's study, Mr. Bundy told Dr. Killian that
the Board should include in its review discushions with the
Sccretaries of State and Defense and the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff -- Mr. Bundy indicating thát the Secretary of
Defense has particular reservationg about the DOI'S report

Another matter montioned by mr. Bundy was his belief that
the moralc of the intelligence.community as a whole stands to
suffer in the absence of a carefully done review and report
nhiên là boảng cxpected from the Board.
)
With regard to the interim report which the Boord has under
way, Kr, Bundy informed the Chairman that the report could be
delivered to him or it could be presented to the president directly
and Mr. Manndy thought it important that the Boatni present it to
the President in porsón. One, other matter discussed was the Board's
concern about any intelligence let-down in the wake of the Cuba
cribis, it being jr. Bundy'o belief that no such let-doom is in
prospect if prosont directives, and discussiono on-time getoject have
any effect in Government.

The Chairman asked the DCI whether the MONGOOSE activity
presented any particular intelligence problem in the Cuba
situation. Mr. McCone said that it had not. He said that
in the MONGOOSE activity, the Spécial Group and the Attorney
General had given a great deal of consideration to the need.
for intelligence collection with respect to Cuba, but the
Intelligence needed was primarily for covert action rather
than other purposes. lievertheless, the HONGOOSE activity
contributed to the lover-all intelligence collection effort
on Cuba. Hr. Mocone recalled that there was a hiatus in the
collection of intelligence on Cuba, after the Bay of Pigs in-
Vaston, and when he took office in November 1961 Hr. McConc
was surprised to learn that no interrogation of Cuban rofugees
was, aking place. Thereafter, following discussions with
the President and the Attorney General they got the refugee
interrogations under way.

Hr. Murphy wondered why there had been a let-down.in

assumed that the reasonn hnd to do with discounagement and
other psychological factors: In response to Dr. Killian's
Question as to whether another intelligence let-down was in
store in the wake of the Cuba crisis, Mr. McCone said that
there was in fact a great danger of such a development following
what some officials consider was an \"intelligence victory\"
for the United States. Mr. McCone, noting that the Soviet
SA-2's remain in Cuba, said he had brought this up forcefully
a week ago at an HSC Exécutive Committee meeting, and thẻ

fact take one step back and two steps, forward, and hold on to
the Cuba real estate as a propaganda and insurgency base,
as a means of keeping Castro Tunder control, or in order to
retain a capability for quick restoration of a Soviet offensive
capability. The kind of concerted intelligence action which
the DCI had in mind would include (1) penetration of the Castro
government regime, (2) the placement of additional agent teams
in Cuba, (3) the continuation of efforts to obtain the assistance
of British, French and German representatives in Cuba, (4) the
possible obtaining of useful intelligence from the attorney,
Donovan, who is negotiating prisoner releases, and (5) possibly
the obtaining of useful information from the captain of the
\"African Pilot\" who had a 3-hour talk with Castro and who
yesterday asked to see a U. S. intelligence officer.

Mr. Pace asked whether Mr. McCone would favor the use of
Guantanamo Naval Base as a base for launching intelligence and
related oporations against Cuba. Mr.MeCone said that he would
not be in favor of this because if we were caught using Guantanamo.
for intelligence operations Castro would obtain UN and other support
for Cuba's demands for. U. S. evacuation of the Naval Base.

Answering General Doolittle's' question, the DCI stated that.
U-2 overflights of Cuba were going at the rate of two a day, re-
sulting in coverage of all targets once a week and in coverage of
some important targets (e.g., harbors) more often. Mr. Mc Cone said
that COMOR and USIB list the targets and that he then establishes.
flight schedules.

Going back to the subject of Guantanamo, Mr. Pace asked whether
the DCI had made a study of the expected intelligence return that
would be obtained if intelligence operations were conducted from
the Base Mr. Pace adding that he thought such a study should be
made before a final policy decision was reached. Mr. McCone said.
that he had not made such a study. He added that in August the
\"operators\" in CIA had proposed to the MONGOOSE Group that Guan-
tanamo Base be so used, but this was opposed at the policy level.
Mr. Me Cone said that he would not be opposed to a restudy of the
proposal at this time. In answer to Dr. Killian's inquiry, Mr.
MeCone confirmed that we are conducting SIGINT Operations at
Guantanamo, and Mr. Kirkpatrick noted that NSA had only recently
added two more positions there.

Mr. Hurphy asked the DCI to state the meaning of \"MONGOOSE
BPLUS\". Mr. McCone explained that in the MONGOOSE Group it
was originally conceived that Phase I would be one of gathering
intelligence on the possibilities for the organization and supply:
of résistance groups within Cuba, but this effort was only Tainly
successful\" because Castro has some 100,000 informers in place in
Cuba and exercises internal security controls through a system of
ration cards, and therefore, CIA did not get as many teams into
Ouba es had been hoped. On August 10, Phase II was reached with-
MONGOOSE planning for (a) violent actions (b) a relatively high
level of actions, or \"B PLUS\", and lesser actions, or \"B MINUS\"
Mr. McCone said that he had not been prepared to endorse proposed
\"B: PLUS\" actions in the absence of plans for military backing,
because of his own speculation that the U.S. would be faced with
MEBMA in Cuba. In any case, the MONGOOSE offort became divertel
by considerations of Soviet activities in Cuba, Mr. MeConestated.

In answer to a question from Mr. Murphy as to who chairs the
MONGOOSE Group at this time, Mr. McCony said that he did not know
Whether Hr. Bundy or the Attorney General was now serving as
Chairman.

With roference to the absence of photographic evidence of Soviet
offensive missile deployment prior to October 14 photography, Mu.
Mì Công said that if one looks at photography hotography of Cuba obtained on
Sentonber 5 it is possible to spot oyidendo of activity at the st
Cristobal HREM site, but this activity cou have been that of
agricultural workers and the evidence did not then point to missile
activity. Dr. Killian noted the Board's concorn that Soviet camer

own great concern that the Soviets are deceiving us by camouflage
methods. Acknowledging that our intelligence estimates leave a
certain margin for error, Hr. McConé noted that it is nevertheless
impossible for us to say that we know all that is going on in the.
USSR with respect to missile activity. In response to Dri-Killian's
comment that public discussions seem to indicate that U. S. missile
capabilities are superior to those of the USSR, the DCI considered.
that any such conclusion is erroneous and dangerous and could lead
to a complacency which might well result in curtailment of the U. s.
missile program by an economy-minded Congress. Mr. McCone added
that in his presentations to select Committees of the Congress he
always expresses reservations concerning U. S. missile superiority.

Dr. Killian wondered whether the President, the Secretary of
Defense, and the Congress understand the danger of conclusions that
\"nothing is there because it can't be seen\". Mr. MoCone said that
undoubtedly there is a tendency toward heavy dependence upon photo-
graphic intelligencc.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE
SUBJECT: Meeting of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board
December 6 and 7, 1962.
The Board convened on December 6, 1962, at the call of the Chairman,
Dr. Killian, for a two-day meeting at the Board's offices, Room 297, Executive
Office Building.
Beginning at 10:00 a.m., Board members Murphy, Gray, Doolittle, and Baker
reviewed materials and summary memoranda which had been assembled as the result
of a study conducted by the Board staff of information then available concerning
intelligence aspects of the Soviet military buildup in Cuba.
At 12:30 p.m. the Board Panel on Cuba (Messrs. Murphy, Gray and Doolittle),
and Messrs. Coyne and Ash, proceeded to CIA Headquarters at Langley, Virginia.
Purpose of the visit was to discuss with DCI and the members of the DCI's ad hoc
committee that committee's interim findings which had been reached thus far
in its study and preparation of a report on the actions taken by the U. S
intelligence community relating to the Soviet buildup in Cuba prior to October 14,
1962 (Details of the Board Panel's discussion with the DCI, et al., are set forth
in a separate memorandum in the Board's files.)
At 6:00 p.m. Dr. Harold Brown, Director of Defense Research and Engineering,
Department of Defense, joined the Board meeting for a discussion of some aspects
of advanced intelligence collection capabilities. Those present were Messrs.
Killian, Murphy, Gray, Doolittle, Baker, Clifford, and Pace, and Messrs. Coyne and Ash
Dr. Killian informed Dr. Brown that the Board had in mind discussing Project
OXCART with the President, and the Board anticipated that the President would have

to maintaining coverage of activities in Cuba
Dr. Killiar. next informed the Board that he was somewhat troubled by the
position of the Board with respect to the following: (1) Mr. Bundy once told
Dr. Killian that inasmuch as a special. Cuban operation had beer. laid on with the
Attorney General involved, the MONGOOSE group would have particular jurisdiction with
respect to Cuba (2) during the height of the Cuba crisis the Boarl had not been
Included in the designated recipients of intelligence regarding strategic missiles
in Cuba, and (3) it would appear essential that the Board have an opportunity
to examine the records of the Special Group.
Mr. Gray pointed to an additional matter of concern to the Board, namely,
the view expressed by Dr. Charyk that different interpretations had resulted from
the analysis of satellite and U-2 photography of the same areas. Dr. Kiilian
agrced that this presents a most serious problem, because our Government could
induced to adout an unwarranteć attitude of disbelief regarding Soviet military
capabilities in the same way that an attitude of disbelief was engendered with
respect to the likelihood of the Soviet introduction of an offensive missile
capability into Cuba.
Mr. Gray, referring again to comments made to him by Dr. Churyk, thought
that Dr. Charyk had identified two additional problems which would seem to be of
concern to the Board, namely (1) the near shortage of photographic film which
prevailed Quring the week of October 15, and (2) the fact that when U. 3. intelligence
operations detected the presence of C-Band radar in Cuba, the U. S. was surprised
by this and had no C-Band jammers available except a laboratory model in the
possession of a Government contractor, despite the fact that we had discovered
as early as 1961 that the Soviets possessed this radar capability With respect
to the latter point, Dr. Baker affirmed the seriousness of the problem, noting

that our ELINT coverage had revealed that this radar capability was deployed in
the USSR against our SAC forces but nevertheless our B-52-s still have not
been eqr.ipped with a capability to jam this Soviet radar.
Mr. Clifford expressed the view that the Board has a peculiar and particular
responsibility to the President in assessing intelligence aspects of the Cuba
experience, particularly in the light of the earlier debacle at the Bay of Pigs
at which time the President stated privately that he could not make correct
decisions without correct intelligence, and that he could not endure another
Cuba\". Therefore, Mr. Clifford recalled, the President had established this Board
and one of the reas as for doing so was to bring professionalism into the field
of U. S. foreign intelligence. Now the possibility arises that valid refugee
reports on Soviet use of Cuban caves may be disregarded. Mr. Clifford also feared
that the Administration may now have adopted the view that everything is all right
again now that the missiles and the bombers are out of Cuba. Mr. Clifford
acknowledged that no policy advisory officials like to have a check mede on the
advice they give to the President, and this is understandable, but on the other
hand the President looks to the Board to assess the intelligence aspects of the
policy advisory function. Mr. Clifford believed that CIA had made errors in not
conducting sufficient overflights, and top level Presidential advisers erred in not
proposing sufficient overflights of Cuba. And now that the Cuba crisis was
successfully met by the President, the feeling in responsible parts of Government
seems to be that things turned out all right so why bother the President.
Mr. Clifford said that he of course could not say what the President thinks about
the U. S. intelligerce job that was done regarding Cuba, but the President did
say to the recent meeting of the Business Advisory Council that the DCI had been
the only one who had called the shots on what was going on in Cuba. This prompted)

Mr. Clifford to observe that if the President thinks a good intelligence opération
took place, this could have dangerous implications, and therefore the Board should
push on with its thorough review of the subject no matter what attitudes of
resistance are encountered among the Government agencies involved. Dr. Killian
expressed complete agreement with these observations of Mr. Clifford
General Doolittle questioned whether the Board was certain that the President.
was not informed of the views expressed by the DCI in the cables which he dispatched
to CIA from France Dr. Killian said he did not know the answer to this, but he
was disturbed at the manner in which the DCI was making this case for himself
Mr. Murphy advised the Board that he had been told by the DCI that General Carter'
had not informed the President about the cables received from the DCI. Dr. Killian
thought that this question of whether the DCI had communicated with the President
should be pursued with the DCI when he joined the Board meeting today. General
Doolittle added that it would be appropriate to ask whether General Carter had
been instructed by the DCI to make the DCI's views known to the President
Mr. Clifford surmised that General Carter could have thought that the DCI would
have returned if he considered his views urgent
Mr. Gray was of the opinion that it was in the area of CIA's Deputy DCI/
Intelligence where the DCI's messages were ignored, and therefore it would be
well for the Board to talk to that Deputy.
Mr. Pace felt that the intelligence weaknesses apparent in the Cuba situation
indicate the presence of broader weaknesses. He thought that in highlighting the
weaknesses observed in the Cuba matter, the Board would be in a position to make
recommendations for broader improvements in the foreign intelligence effort.
Dr. Langer cautioned the Board to consider, however, that out of the thousands
of refugee reports coming in there were bound to be reports containing false, and

misleading information. Mr. Pace observed that if that line of thinking were
pursued to its conclusion the question would arise as to why we should have a
refugee interrogation program. Mr. Pace was of the opinion, however, that the
interrogation program offered an unprecedented opportunity to obtain information
and CJA should have made the most of it. Mr. Pace recalled that the Board had
received articulate briefings on Cuba from Mr. Cline of CIA, who also reportedly
briefed Prime Minister MacMillan, the President and others, but Mr. Pace wondered
on what firm intelligence basis these briefings had been conducted. Mr. Murphy
noted that Mr. Coyne's study reflected that on August 14 Mr. Cline had issued an
order not to publish any information on missile basës unless it had been checked
out with NPIC. Dr. Killian then suggested, and Board members agreed, that an
effort should be made to have a discussion with Mr. Cline during this meeting

Secretary of Defense. (Dr. Killian expressed the view that the DCI, as coordinator
of the overall U. S. intelligence effort, should certainly have the right to look
at the budget of any element of the intelligence community, and Mr. McCone said
he thought that he could work this out.) The DCI went on to say that the total
Department of Defense Budget is $3 billion whereas the CIA budget is around $400
million and the Defense budget is up over the previous $2 billion figure because
the Secretary of Defense has added the cost of the reconnaissance program. The
result is, Mr. McCone said, that the USB is unable to look at this large budget
and therefore Mr. McCone is endeavoring to discuss it with Secretary McNamara.
As for the CIA budget, Mr. McCone had thought that it could be kept at last year's
level through reorganization steps and cutting down on wasteful expenditures, and
at the same time an effort has been made to absorb salary increases within the
existing budget. The DCI said that despite hard work on the CIA budget by all CIA
elements, then there had to be added on the cost of the Cuba operations, so the
former budget of CIA is up to $425 million, exclusive of $146 million involved in
OXCART and NRO The Bureau of the Budget cut this down to $381 million by charging
the Cuba budget to the CIA's Contingency Reserve over the opposition of the DCI who
feels that the Reserve should be held intact for use in unforeseeable emergencies.
Mr. McCone said he was not sure how all this would finally be resolved with the
Bureau of the Budget.
Turning to another subject, Mr. McCone explained the MONGOOSE project in
answer to an inquiry from Mr. Clifford. The DCI said that this project developed
out of a discussion last Fall between himself, the President and the Attorney General.
The objective is to create dissensions in Cuba which will lead to revolt against
the Castro regime and to the unseating of Castro, leaving the Cubans to form a
government of their own choosing. Some $26 million of the CIA budget is allouce

to activities authorized by the MONGOOSE Committee (Composed of the Special Group,
plus the Attorney General and 2 or 3 other officials). MONGOOSE plans are developed
under the coordination of General Lansdale who works with State, Defense, CIA and
USIA elements for this purpose. Mr. McCone said that the first phase of the project
was an intelligence gathering effort. The second phase was to involve sabotage,
insurgency and other actions which were tentatively agreed upon at the MONGOOSE
meeting of August 10 but which then fell into limbo during the Culan crisis until
two days ago when the Executive Committee of the NSC tentatively renewed consideration
of the project. Mr. McCone said that he personally does not favor sabotage or
guerilla activity for a few months until the dust settles. The DCI said he was
disturbed over the possibility of a new confrontation by the Soviets who could take
the stand that there had been compliance with U. S. demands for removal of offensive
weapons and therefore any continuance of U. S. aerial surveillance of Cuba will be
countered by shoot-downs of our surveillance aircraft by SA-2's. Dr. Langer suggested
that the SA-2 defenses might be for the purpose of meeting an anticipated invasion of
Cuba by the U. S., but Mr. McCone thought not, pointing out that the SA-2's would
be easy to knock out if an invasion should take place.
Turning to the NRO, Mr. McCone said that the Defense Department/CIA agreement
had not worked out too well because the Director of NRO feels he should have fiscal
control over Department of Defense as well as CIA resources, through a review of

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT: Board Meeting of November 9, 1962

The Board convened in meeting at 9:00 a.m., on November 3,
1962, at the offices of the Board in the Executive Office Building.
Dr. Baker presided as Acting Chairman in the absence of Dr. Killian.
Board members Gray, Doolittle, Murphy and Clifford were present as
were Mr. Coyne and the writer. (Messrs. Pace and Langer were out
of the country at the time of this meeting. Illness prevented Dr.
Land's attendance.)

Dr. Baker informned the Board that Messrs. Coyne and Ash had
done a unique assembly of material for the Board's use in considering
the intelligence aspects of the Soviet missiles buildup in Cuba.
Dr. Baker expressed the view that the materials which had been
assembled are far too complicated for the Board to consider in the
course of only one day, and therefore the Board would look to
Mr. Coyne and Mr. Gray for selective reporting to the Board con-
cerning the highlights of the coverage which had been accomplished
thus far in the Board's review of the Cuba situation.

Dr. Baker observed that the conflict involving Cuba is an
intelligence conflict. The government does not know for sure the
positions of anti-aircraft artillery units which are protecting
the SA-2 sites in Cuba. Furthermore, intelligence is lacking on
such elementary things as the support facilities which serve the
SA-2 installations. Based on the intelligence which has been ob-
talned, it appears that except for Moscow and Leningrad the island
of Cuba 1.s now equipped with the best air defense system in the
world. It is possible that Cuba is now on the verge of insuring
against invasion by reason of its possession of an assembly of the
most dangerous armaments which have heretofore been collected in
an area of that size. In the UN the United States is discussing
inspection and surveillance proposals and positions which in Dr.
Baker's view are a century out of date. Dr. Baker said that he
does not know how much the President is aware of these things, but
there is a serious proposal being discussed which would contemplate
one or two inspections a month, whereas we well know that within
72 hours there can be made operational a most dangerous offensive
capability.

Mr. Murphy wondered what specifically had caused the decision
to be made to transfer from CIA to SAC the responsibility for re-
connaissance of Cuba. Mr. Mphy thought that an understanding of
the reasons for this shift of responsibility is important because
the Board itself seemed to have been oblivious to developments
which were of such a nature as to warrant the stepped-up coverage
by SAC. Mr. Gray's comment on this was to the effect that he had
noted an uncertainty in the past with regard to whether the problem
of Cuba had been removed from the Board's area of responsibility.
Mr. Gray recalled remarks by the Chairman at a Board meeting last
summer indicating that the Cuba situation was being looked at else-
where in Government. Therefore, Mr. Gray thought that if in fact
the Board's responsibility extends to Cuba this should be made clear
for the benefit of the Board. In Mr. Gray's opinion if the Board
in fact had such a responsibility, then the Board should have been
addressing itself to the implications of public statements such as
those being made by Senator Keating and others, and particularly
the statement by Senator Keating on October 10, 1962, that ballistic
missile installations were being constructed in Cuba.

Acting Chairman Baker informed the Board that he had confirmed
with the Chairman that the Chairman's remarks at the last summer's
Board meeting were intended to convey that it was only in the
NSC. 5412/2 area that Cuba matters where being handled outside the
purview of the Board.

Continuing, Mr. Gray said that it was a matter of personal
regret to him that the public statements by Senators Keating,
Humphry and others had not served to flag the situation.

Mr. Coyne said that following that line of reasoning he him-
self could be said to have been at fault. Mr. Coyne went on to
poir.t out in this connection that Senator Keating and others were.
speaking from the benefit of Executive Branch briefings which they
had received, including General Carter's briefing of the Republican
Policy Committee. In any case, the Senators had only information
which was in the possession of the Executive Branch. Insofar as
this information was based on foreign intelligence acquisitions,
Mr. Coyne pointed out that all of the U.S. foreign intelligence
agencies are under instruction and have an obligation to furnish
the Board with all significant information derived from the
foreign intelligence effort, and if such instructions and under-
standings were not in effect the Board would be in the position
of having to dig out the intelligence information which the
agencies are obligated to provide to the Board on a systematic
basis. In the case of the developing Cuban situation, however,
Mr. Coyne pointed out that a top level decision was made to give
limited distribution of intelligence information on Cuba and the
Board was excluded from those elements of the government which
were designated to receive it.

a periodic regional intelligence bulletin on Southeast Asia,
and that consideration is being given to issuing similar:
regional intelligence bulletins for consumers in other areas.
He described this particular recommendation as being a \"good
suggestion.\"

At this point Mr. Clifford, reverting to the discussion
on the Hanson Baldwin matter, asked whether a separate investi-
gative unit is being established as recommended by the Board,
in lieu of the referral of leaks for investigation by the FBI.
Mr. McCone responded that this matter is still under considera-
tion; that in his own office he is prepared to set up such a
unit; that he and the President feel this action must be taken;
but that there is growing concern in some quarters that the
creation of such a unit might ultimately lead to the establish-
ment of some kind of internal Gestapo.

Mr. McCone next turned to the subject of Cuba. He said.
that in late July there was first witnessed an increased tempo
of Soviet bloc shipments to Cuba, and by August the rate of
shipments had more than doubled. On August 10, 1962 there was
held a meeting of Principals (the President not participating)
to discuss Cuban operations which had taken place during the
preceding months of 1962. Up to that time there had been an
exploratory intelligence effort primarily aimed at providing
a basis for deciding what covert actions could be taken
against the Castro regime. The results of this intelligence
effort had been reflected in reports appearing in the Central
Intelligence Bulletin and in items which were set forth in the
Presidential Check List. At that time, Mr. McCone said, he
analyzed the developments in Cuba as indicating 1) the establish-
ment of a sophisticated SIGINT operation to be directed against
our space activities at Camp Canaveral, (2) the establishment
of a comprehensive air defense system, or (3) the introduction
of a MRBM capability, or possibly all three. However, no one
shared Mr. McCone's feeling that the Soviet activities in Cuba
were directed toward the establishment of a ballistic missile
capability. On the contrary, the Department of State and the
Office of National Estimates within the CIA considered that such
action by the Russians would be a departure from established
Soviet policy.

Mr. McCone said that throughout August a careful watch
was maintained with respect to developments in Cuba, and in
late August the construction of SAM sites was detected.
By August 23, when Mr. MeCone left the country (on his honey-
moon), there had been obtained photographic evidence of the
construction of seven SAM sites together with evidence of
extreme security measures being taken with respect to the
unloading of ships at Cuban ports. These developments, Mr.
McCone related, gave rise to considerable worry on his part,

Control System

NW 88132
Docld:34671885 Page 7

and prior to his departure from the country, on August 23,
he took the occasion on August, 21, 22, and 23 to express his
worry to the President and to the Secretary of Defense.
Mr. McCone acknowledged that he had no positive evidence to
support his concern, but he reasoned that the extensive air
defense buildup which was underway in Cuba had as its immediate
purpose the denial of the surveillance by the United States of
the Soviet missile buildup in Cuba. The U-2 photography which
was being obtained reflected that 26 SA-2 sites would be
installed in Cuba. Mr. McCone observed that while the photo-
graphy obtained at the time did not provide evidence of missile
sites, a current review of that photography indicates the
presence of tents and some construction equipment. Mr. Mc-
Cone said that when he left the country on August 23, the
instructed that a daily CIA bulletin be initiated at once with
respect to Cuban developments, and he initiated issuance of
this reporting after consultation with the US.IB.
an incident was created by the U-2 which \"wandered\" over Soviet
territory, and also when the U-2 was shot down over Communist
China on September 8, these incidents caused Mr. McCone to be
concerned. Nevertheless, overflights were ordered. It developed,
however, that from September 17 to September 20, weather con-
ditions would not permit the overflights of Cuba.

When in September
At about that time the Special NSC 5412/2 Group, as well
as the CIA, became convinced that some risk was involved in
the conduct of U-2 operations over Cuba. For that reason,
Mr. McCone said, the flights which were scheduled were of a
peripheral nature. Four flights were authorized and flowm
in late September and in early October, but because of their
peripheral or semi-peripheral character they did not cover the
western area of Cuba. Mr. McCone recalled that in early..
October there had been seen refugee reports concerning mysterious
shipments being transported over Cuban roads, and there were
other things of this nature reported by refugees.

As reflected in the SNIE dated September 19, 1962, Mr.
McCone said that the USIB dismissed the possibility that MRBMs
were being introduced into Cuba, and this view was based on
the belief that such introduction would confront the USSR with
so many difficulties that the action would not be undertaken.
Mr. McCone said that he was in France when he received a sum-
mary of the SNIE, and he disagreed with its conclusicas because
he could not see why the Soviets were establishing such a
comprehensive air defense system in Cuba unless this was being
done to shield the island against U. S. surveillance and to
protect the conduct of some clandestine operation.

became greater. But even if this flight had been conducted,
in Mr. McCone's opinion there would not at that time have
been obtained information of a more convincing nature than
was later obtained as a result of the October 14 mission.
Mr. MoCone said that on September 7 he made a recommendation
that more frequent flights be conducted, and it continues to
be Mr. McCone's view that there should have been more in-
tense U-2 coverage during September.

Mr. Clifford asked why and from where was there concern
over a possible U-2 incident involving Cuba. Mr. McCone said
that this view was held within the NSC 5412 Group and in CJA
as well. Mr. McCone said that he held a different view but
he was away at the time. He cited as a current example of
concern attaching to the possibility of U-2 incidents the fact
that today the Special Group considered a U-2 flight over the
China-India border, and great concern was expressed in the
Group because the mission would have to include an overflight
of Burma, and the prospect of the Burma overflight creating
another U-2 incident was a matter of considerable sensitivity
within the Group.

Mr. Clifford observed that while this concern might well
be understandable in the case of Burma, he was nevertheless
unable to understand why there should be a similar concern
about reaction to a U-2 incident which might arise with respect
to Cuba. Mr. McCone said that such concern with respect to
Cúba does not exist today and, as a matter of fact, on that
very day there were being conducted ten low-level and 3 U-2
missions against Cuba.

Mr. Clifford made the comment that he feared that the
Board might possibly be subjected to criticism in the light
of the fact that there was no photographic reconnaissance over
Cuba between September 5 and October 14, despite the DCI'S
own suspicions and the content of refugee reports with respect
to a Soviet missile buildup in Cuba.

Mr. Murphy inquired of Mr. McCone as to whether clandestine
agents are being successfully operated in Cuba. Mr. McCone.
answered by saying that there have been three rather ineffective
teams operating in Cuba with the principal objective of organizing
dissidence against the Castro regime rather than obtaining
intelligence. He said that there are approximately 40 third-
country agents plarted in various foreign embassies in Cuba, but
we obtained no hard intelligence from them regarding the military
buildup.

could be reintroduced into Cuba as below-deck cargoes. Mr.
Clifford thought that it would be a good idea to continue our
surveillance in order to ascertain the destination of these
ships and the disposition made of the missiles, and Mr. Mc-
Cone said that we can probably track the ships into the
Black Sea and the Ealtic, but that we would not be able to
cover the unloading and transshipment of missiles into Soviet
ports.

Mr. Murphy wondered what had been the inspiration for
the commitment not to invade Cuba. Mr. McCone supposed that
this resulted from a Russian offer to do certain things in
return for things which they asked for.

Mr. Clifford asked whether it is possible for the United
States to develop intelligence sources in Cuba which would.
relieve our dependence upon photographic intelligence. Mr.
McCone said that this is difficult to do primarily because
Castro had instituted a police state in Cuba and, as an example
of this, Mr. McCone cited the practice of the Castro regime
in following a procedure whereby in effect the ration cards
of the Cuban people serve as identification cards. Mr. McCone
said that previously eight or nine teams of trained agents
had been introduced into Cuba since April. Three of these
teams remain in Cuba, the rest have been either killed or
came back from their mission. Mr. McCone said that we have
not been able to obtain much intelligence from these three
teams because their principal activity has been to maintain
their survival.

Mr. Clifford said that he found it hard to understand
why the United States has not been able to develop intelligence
sources within Cuba, a country situated only 90 miles away
from the United States, and one with which we have enjoyed
the friendliest relations for 60 years. Mr. McCone said that
approximately 2000 Cubans are coming out of Cuba every week
and at that rate practically all of the responsible Cubans
have left the island. Mr. McCone said after the Bay of Pigs
invasion an intelligence \"paralysis\" set in for a time.
Then, in December 1961, the President and the Attorney General
and Mr. McCone had discussions leading to the instigation
of some operations in Cuba. Mr. McCone said that he was
aghast to learn at that time there were no refugee interroga-
tions being conducted, and so the interrogation center was
established at Opalaka. He said that within CIA a 500-man
task force was set up to work on the Cuba problem and dis-
appointing results have been obtained. Mr. McCone said that

Docld:34671885 Page 10

he is now concerned and he has had under review the question
as to whether too much dependence is being placed on refugees
as sources of information, and consideration is being given as
to whether it may be necessary to send U. S. citizens into
Cuba as intelligence agents. He said that we are not getting.
intelligence on Cuba through conventional means. Mr. Murphy
observed that this is a salient point of interest to the
Board. Mr. McCone repeated his concern which he had earlier
expressed that even with the Soviet missiles removed, the
Castro regime will continue to be a center of insurgency
for Latin America, as indicated by the fact that during the
recent days of the Cuban crisis orders were issued from
Within Cuba for the initiation of insurgency action in other
Latin American countries.

At this point Mr. McCone's visit with the Board terminated
and the Board recessed for lunch.

At 1:45 p.m., General Carroll, Director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, joined the Board meeting. General Carroll
said that in an attempt to anticipate the specific matters
in which the Board might be interested, he had prepared some
materials regarding the Cuban situation over the period from
last summer up to October 14 and thereafter. He said that
the extreme pressures which had prevailed, and the requirement
for daily presentations to top level officials concerning the
progress of the Cuban situation, had made it impossible for
him to complete a detailed survey up to this time, but that
such a survey was in process within the DIA.

General Carroll began by describing briefly the role of
the DIA'S CIIC which was responsible for the coordination of
intelligence regarding the Cuban situation. In July 1962, the
CIIC reported on the increased Soviet shipping into Cuba.
In August, reports were disseminated with regard to increasing
introduction of Soviet materials. On September 8, the CIIC
reported that the scope of the Soviet bloc assistance to Cuba
suggested motives going beyond the lending of support and
encouragement to the Castro regime.
On August 15, in an effort
to supply guidance and requirements for photographic recon-
naissance, the DIA asked that the NPIC conduct a study and
review of photographic intelligence which had previously been
obtained with respect to three areas in Cuba. On August 17,
photographic evidence indicated that SA-2 equipment was
located in two of the three areas, although there was no
evidence of deployment as yet. The next photographic mission
flown on August 29 disclosed the presence of two SA-2 sites
and the presence of a third site at Banes. Moreover, a
study of the photographic evidence concerning the SA-2 sites,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE
SUBJECT: President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board
Meeting of April 2-3, 1964

A regularly scheduled two-day meeting of the President's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board was convened by Chairman
Clifford at 9:00 a.m., April 2, 1964, in the Eoard's offices,
Room 297, Executive Office Building. Present were Board
members Doolittle, Gray, Baker, Langer, Pace and Murphy;
J. Patrick Coyne, Executive Secretary; and A. R. Ash.
(Dr. Land was unavoidably detained at the Boston airport, and
joined the Board meeting later in the day.)

Chairman Clifford opened the meeting with some general
remarks, first congratulating Mr. Murphy on the excellence of
his recently published and well-received book \"Diplomat Among
Warriors Other Board members joined in the sentiments ex-
pressed by the Chairman.

Next Mr. Clifford expressed the Board's gratitude to the
Board Panel on NRO matters for the long and difficult task
involved in the Panel's extensive study of the NRO management
and organization structure and attendant problems. He noted
that Dr. Baker and General Doolittle had been devoting the
majority of their time to the study, with inestimable assis-
tance from Mr. Coyne. The Chairman thought that in the NRO
matter the Board had probably made the most exhaustive analysis
of any intelligence-related problem up to this time.

Chairman Clifford announced that in a few minutes the
meeting would be joined briefly by Mr. Henry Thomas of CIA for
the purpose of indoctrinating Board members concerning two new
security clearance categories (DORIAN and QUILL) covering two
extremely sensitive areas of intelligence activity.

Mr. Clifford recalled that when the Board met with the
President on January 30, the President had sought the Board's
views on a proposed reduction in the Military Services repre-
sentation on the U.S. Intelligence Board -- the Board expres-
sing its long-held view that such reduction should be made at
an appropriate time. Mr. Clifford went on to inform the Board
that on February 5, 1964, Presidential Assistant McGeorge Bundy
had issued a memorandum to the intelligence community, announcing
the President's decision to reconstitute the USIB membership.
by designating the Director of DIA as the Defense Department

Mr. Clifford pointed out that the DCI feels that because the NRO
is presently set up as a \"line\" organization in the Air Force, a great deal.
goes on that the DCI does not know about, e.g., after USIB sets out intelligence
requirements for NRO to execute, the DCI does not have an opportunity to
examine the effectiveness of the program. Mr. Vance agreed that the DCI should
be kept fully informed, but if weather conditions, for example, require that
a 5-day mission be called down on the third day, this is the kind of operational
decision that should not have to involve the DCI.

Dr. Baker referred to concerns which have been expressed regarding the
tendency toward a fragmentation of effort in the reconnaissance field within
the Defense Department, as for example in the case of the MOL. Noting that
Defense is the greatest resource for national reconnaissance, Dr. Baker asked
whether consideration had been given to relating the JRC to the NRO, with a
view to avoiding unnecessary duplication of peripheral reconnaissance missions,
the reduction of costs, and the placing of emphasis on meeting national require-
ments. Mr. Vance replied that tying the JRC into the NRO suggests some command
channel problems, but he thought the suggestion very worth while, and he
expressed the intention to consider it further.

Dr. Langer referred to the system of monitors of the NRP in Defense and
in the CIA, and he asked whether the Director of NRO in fact reports to
Dr. Fubini in Defense. Mr. Vance replied that, to the contrary, the Director
reports directly to Mr. Vance and to Secretary McNamara. He added that as an
internal matter Dr. Pubini monitors NRO matters for the office of the Secretary
of Defense and Mr. Vance would continue this internal Defense arrangement but
would clearly spell out the role of the PFIAB, et al, to accomplish external
monitoring.

Secretary Vance completed his discussion with Board members and left
the Board meeting at 11:50 a.m.

In executive session, Board members further discussed the question of
appropriate assignment to CIA of a role in the NRP -- with the object of
preserving the valuable research and development potential of the CIA. Mr. Joyne
noted that the Board Panel had heard testimony that CIA is heavily involved
in reconnaissance research and development, but that this was not yet supported.
by the evidence thus far assembled. Mr. Coyne added that under the Vance.
proposal to leave aircraft projects in CIA, this would include 9 OXCART aircraft
2 U-2's at Taiwan, 3 U-2's at Lockheed undergoing configuration for carrier
operations, and aircraft engaged in the STPOLLY project. Mr. Coyne also noted
that of the 694 personnel providing support for CIA's aircraft reconnaissance
activities, 350 are AF personnel assigned to the CIA.

At 12:10 p.m. the Board meeting was joined by Mr. Ray Cline, Deputy...
Director for Intelligence, and Mr. Bruce Clark, of CIA. Mr. Clifford indicated
to Mr. Cline the Board's interest in receiving a current intelligence briefing
on aspects of the world situation.

Mr. Cline informed the Board that his job at CIA is the correlation and
evaluation of intelligence relating to the national ional 1 secur security. v. With reference
to the state of the art in the field of intelligence analysis, Mr. Cline pointed

and storable high energy propellant fuel.

As for Soviet MRBM's and IRBM's, Mr. Cline said that there are over
700 launchers, mostly in the Western USSR; deployment is almost complete;
and there is evidence of some hardening (four silos have been discovered).

Mr. Cline said that it is not cervain as to how much the USSR intends
to invest in the development of an anti-missile missile. Satellite photography
is the key. A March 1964 photo of Leningrad shows 5 distinctive bays at launch
sites, but it is indicated that the USSR probably suspended construction in 1963.

In further emphasis on the importance of special search satellite
photography, Mr. Cline said that a GAMBIT mission has not yet been run over a
huge mystery structure recently revealed in photography of Moscow.

Mr. Cline reported that yesterday the Soviets had launched a space probe
to Venus, the time of arrival estimated as July 22.

Concerning the recent release of the CIA estimate on the Soviet economy,
Mr. Cline said that despite the welter of denials and counterattacks by the
USSR, the CIA has indications that its estimate was correct. The first \"Pravda\"
blast contained statistics confirming the CIA's estimate of a 3 per cent gain
in the Soviet GNP. The next issue of Pravda omitted these statistics.

As for the Sino-Soviet conflict, Mr. Cline stated that this deep and
bitter struggle reflects opposing national interests and policy views, and is
a contest for dominance which is nearing the breaking point. The anti-Soviet
vituperation coming out of Communist China is unprecedented. CIA's clandestine
reporting indicates that the Chicoms are attempting to subvert Soviet leadership
around the world, and to discredit Khrushchev in the USSR. Exchanges of secret
Party letters indicate that a Sino-Soviet break must come. The basis of the
dispute seems to be the failure of the USSR to provide the economic and military
support which China needed in crder to enlarge its industrial capacity. Pubiic
exchanges of insults, and intelligence from various sources, shows that the
breach began in 1960 from differences of policy with regard to degree of risk
of war which should be acceptable to Communism in its actions affecting the West.
Also there is a lot of prejudice against China in the Soviet military. Mr. Ciine
does not think that Sino-Soviet differences can be resolved so long as Mao and
Khrushchev are in positions of leadership.

With regard to Indian border action by the Chinese Communists, Mr. Cline
thought that this move was for the purpose of getting control of a part of the
route for a transcontinental railroad.

In Vietnam, Mr. Cline said, the U. S. mission has given General Khanh
a breathing spell to get a grip on the political and military machine. There
is a little more confidence within the South Vietnam government. The Viet Cong
has not launched attacks on the larger scale expected when Khanh took over, but
guerrilla activities have increased and 3 province chiefs have been killed or
kidnapped in the last few weeks. In North Vietnam, recent intelligence indicates,

NW-8327

TOP SECRET

there is civil defense activity including the digging of shelters and
trenches. Last night the Interagency Task Force on Vietnam discussed the
problem and concluded that things are on dead center as far as the South
Vietnam war effort is concerned, and more U. S. support may be necessary
before the rainy season sets in in September. The Viet Cong are getting
Chicom help, mostly psychological; captured weapons indicate that 10 per cent
are of Chinese crigin; many of their weapons are of U. S. and French origin;
and some are hand made.

Mr. Cline concluded his briefing and departed the Board meeting at
1:10 p.m. at which time the Board adjourned for lunch.

At 2:00p.m. the Board resumed in executive session. Chairman Clifford
remarked that the sessior: with Mr. Cline of CIA had been valuable and that
there would be similar briefings arranged for future Board meetings. Mr.
Clifford asked that Board members let Mr. Coyne know ahead of time the subject
matters which they wish to have covered in current intelligence briefings.

Next, Mr. Coyne gave the Board an oral summary of implementing actions
reportedly under way in response to the Board's recommendations in the Dunlap
case. It was noted that in answer to Mr. Bundy's referral of the Board's
recommendations to the DCI for agencies' consideration and the preparation of a
coordinated report by the DCI, the latter had failed to coordinate with other
agencies with respect to 9 of the 21 recommendations. Mr. Coyne had discussed
this with Mr. Bundy who agreed that the DCI should have furnished a coordinated
report of agencies' views and conments, and Mr. Bundy had asked Mr. Coyne to
prepare an appropriate further communication for Mr. Bundy's signature. In
answer to a question by Dr. Langer, the Chairman thought it best to see whether
the DCI complies with the request for a coordinated report, before suggesting
that Mr. Bundy go directly to the agencies.

During the Board's discussion of action reported on its Dunlap case
recommendation relating to the Soviet Union's attempt to obtain new Embassy
quarters in Washington, General Doolittle expressed the hope that steps would
be taken by U. S. intelligence agencies to ensure technical coverage of any
new Embassy that might be constructed for the USSR.

Mr. Ash summarized for the Board recent reports received on the implemen-
tation of Recommendation 3 (CIA-State report); Recommendation 35 (DCI report);
and Old Board Recommendation 3 on the status of JCS-CIA intelligence planning
for wartime emergencies. With regard to the latter, the Chairman asked that
there be put on the agenda of the next Board meeting the matter of the JCS-CIA
suggestion that annual status reports be discontinued.

Chairman Clifford asked that Board members next proceed to discuss the
type of report that the Board would make to the President concerning the NRO.
The Chairman asked Dr. Baker, as head of the Board's NRO Panel, to discuss the
reasons for changes in the NRO as recommended in the draft report which the
Panel had placed before the Board.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT: Meeting of the President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board, January 25-26, 1963

The Board convened in executive session at 10:15 a.m. on
January 25, 1963, on the first day of a two-day meeting in the
Board's offices, Room 297, Executive Office Building. Present
were Board members Gray, Baker, Land, Clifford, Pace, Doolittle,
Murphy, and Langer; and Messrs. Coyne and Ash.

Mr. Gray presided as acting Chairman in place of Dr. Killian
whose arrival was delayed by bad flying weather. Mr. Gray noted
that the DCI, Mr. McCone, had been called to testify before a
Congressional Committee and would therefore be unable to meet
with the Board at 11:30 as scheduled. The acting Chairman then
called for a general discussion of the Board's pending review and
draft report on the intelligence aspects of the circumstances
leading to the Cuba crisis.

Dr. Land expressed the view that although tidying up is an
obligation, and although looking back is a useful technique, the
Board's responsibilities go beyond the conduct of post mortems
for the purpose of identifying past mistakes in the foreign intel-
ligence field. Without detracting from the importance of the
Board's after-the-fact review of the Cuba situation, Dr. Land
thought it equally important that the Board become fully informed
on current developments as well.

Mr. Coyne called Dr. Land's attention to the fact that pre-
viously, in Dr. Land's absence, the Board Lad submitted a December
28, 1962, report to the President which was interim in nature, and
which contained recommendations looking ahead to the strengthening
of U. S. foreign intelligence capabilities in matters not necessarily
confined to the Cuba situation. Taking note of this, Dr. Land
nevertheless thought that the Board should make sure that it knows
what is going on in Cuba today and what are the intelligence and
related actions which are being taken by the U.S. intelligence
community with respect to the Soviet presence in Cuba...

Dr. Baker, referring to theBoard's December 28 interim report
on Cuba, felt that this is one of the most searching and far sighted
that the Board has produced, and he noted that the DCI's written

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET

response to this report was devestatingly empty and inadequate.
Dr. Baker saw no excuse for the fact that the DIA had been afforded
only two days notice to comment on the Board's report prior to the
submission of views by the DCI. (Dr. Langer thought it incredible
that the DCI had given DIA only two days to comment on the Board's
December 28 interim report.) It was Dr. Baker's thought that such
a procedure was contrary to the general agreement which had been
previously reached with Mr. Bundy (in a discussion between Messrs.
Bundy, Baker and Coyne) that White House action memoranda flowing
from Board recommendations would go directly to the agencies pri-
marily concerned. With regard to the latter point, Mr. Coyne
observed that Mr. Bundy had in this instance acquiesced with the
DCI's request that the DCI obtain and report the coordinated views
of the various U. S. intelligence agencies concerned with the
matters covered in the Board's report.

Dr. Langer pointed out to Dr. Land that at the Board's last
meeting (which Dr. Land had been unable to attend) the Board had
been briefed on current aspects of the Cuba situation. Dr. Land,
pursuing the point which he had raised, hoped that the Board would
be able to avoid the submission of a \"boiler plate\" report on the
errors made in the intelligence handling of the Soviet build-up in
Cuba. Dr. Land said he thought that the draft of the final Board
report now before the Board was a good effor, but he hoped that
it would not draw from the agencies involved a book covering past
errors. It was Dr. Land's view that in the intelligence system there
should be someone who knows the whole story and can inform the Board
fully about it. Dr. Land's concern was that the intelligence ele-
ments involved may have been inept and that a year from now they
would be repeating the errors spotted in the Board's report, unless
the Board can get the agency heads to accept the Board's help in
profiting from lessons learned so that mistakes can be avoided in
the future.

Mr. Clifford observed that there is a question of timing in-
volved in the Board's present Cuba review, because the Board was
under a special assignment from the President to prepare a report.
Mr. Clifford thought that the Board would do a better service if
it made a hard-hitting report and recommendations, and then after
an appropriate interval the Board should ascertain whether the
recommendations were being put into effect and urge action on
those which the Board might find were not being implemented.

Dr. Land suggested that the Board should complete its work
on the present draft of its Cuba report and then take steps to get to
the heart of things with respect to intelligence plans and programs

TOP SECRET
regarding Cuba. He added that the Board's responsibilities go to
the effectiveness of the institution and framework within which
the U. S. intelligence community operates, the meeting of day-to-
day concerns which arise, and a determination as to whether re-
creation or reorganization is needed based on the \"massive approach\"
represented by the draft report which the Board had before it.

Mr. Murphy expressed agreement with points made by Dr. Land.
It was Mr. Murphy's view that the intelligence community apparently
does not know enough about what is presently happening in Cuba. He
thought that photographic coverage was not enough and what was
needed was deep cover clandestine agent coverage of Cuba. Dr. Land
added that it was not enough for the Board to make recommendations
but there should also be a \"violent surveillance\" of their imple-
mentation.

Noting the agenda for the day, Mr. Kurphy wondered what the
Chairman had in mind as to the nature and purpose of the Board's
scheduled visit to the Secretary of State. Mr. Gray recalled that
when Mr. Bundy had met with the Board previously he had suggested
that in the course of the Board's Cuba review it might well be use-
ful to discuss with the Secretary's of State and Defense, and the
Chairman of the JCS, their views regarding the U. S. intelligence
coverage given to the Soviet buildup in Cuba. Mr. Gray added that
it was his impression that Mr. Bundy's suggestion had been based
not only on the obtaining of facts pertinent to the Board's review
for intelligence purposes, but also in anticipation of a Congressional
investigation which might be made of the Cuba expérience.

Mr. Murphy thought it important that the Board organize its
interview to be had with the Secretary of State. Mr. Gray suggested
that without going into a re-hash of the chronological summary of
the intelligence aspects, the Board's questions to Secretary Rusk
should include those which would determine the Secretary's views on
what would have been done differently, from the vantage point of
hindsight, with respect to intelligence handling of the Cuba devel-
opment; whether there was a proper weighing of the risks and the
intelligence advantages involved in overflights of Cuba; whether the
intelligence analysis and reporting processes were hindered by pre-
conceived views of U. S. \"Sovietologists\"; and whether raw intelli-
gence reports were adequately communicated to the White House (Mr
Gray recalling that Mr. Bundy had expressed to him the belief that
the President should have been informed of the contents of some of
these reports regarding the sightings of offensive missiles in
Cuba prior to the photography of October 14).

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE
SUBJECT: Cuba

In the course of the Board meeting of January 25, 1963,
the Board members and Mr. Coyne met at the State Department
with the Secretary of State, Assistant Secretary Alexis Johnson
and Mr. Roger Hilsman, Director of Intelligence and Research,
Department of State.

Utilizing the memorandum (copy attached) which contained a
series of questions which had been drafted earlier in the day by
the Board, the Board members elicited Secretary Rusk's views on
a variety of intelligence subjects pertaining to the pre-buildup
and post-buildup period in Cuba.

At the outset Secretary Rusk stated that the two Administra-
tions must share the responsibility for Cuba and that each in turn
has taken full responsibility for what was done or what was not
done during their respective Administrations. He noted that Cuba
is a national problem; that because of it \"we came up up to the edge
of incineration in the Western Hemisphere\"; and that he personally
has a deep anxiety over the question as to where we go from here.
He observed that in the case of a Communist take-over in Cuba or
anywhere else, it is easier to prevent the occurrence than it is
to correct it once it has taken place.

The Secretary was queried as to whether he agreed with the
Board's present finding that from October 14 onward there was an
effective performance by the intelligence community in supplying
support in the policy decision process with respect to the Cuba
situation. The Secretary agreed stating the intelligence community
performance from October 14 onward was superb. He stated that this
performance enabled the panels of the NSC Executive Committee to
recommend the establishment of positions on which the Government
as a whole could and did act.

Secretary Rusk was next queried as to whether he agreed with
the Board's present findings that, prior to October 14 the intelli-
gence performance was clearly deficient and that perhaps this de-
ficiency was not fully known to the Department of State at the time..
The Secretary observed that this was a complex question and a
difficult one to answer. He felt it was terribly important that,

TOP SECRET

as an outgrowth of the review of how the intelligence community
acquitted itself, we not paralyze the community as was done by
the Robert's Commission on Pearl Harbor day\". He observed that
from the point of view of high policy we have got to depend on
people who see a great inflow of information and we must depend
on them to give us balanced judgments, particularly in such a
large area of operation as the Department of State where over
one thousand cables are received and dispatched daily.

The Secretary stated that it was his impression that in mid
September 1962 the intelligence community did not expect the Soviet
Union to put MRBMs or IRBMs in Cuba; that this was the impression
at higher policy-advisory levels; and that because of this over-
all judgment it is possible that intelligence analysts were
diverted from the main point, namely, that offensive missiles
were going in. He thought this diversion might also have been
based upon the September 19 estimate of the intelligence community
and that that estimate might have had the effect of the analysts
feeling that they should pursue a \"hands off attitude\" as far as
anything that came up which concerned the USSR's introduction of
offensive missiles. He said the lesson to be learned from this is
that some means must be found to assure that we do not take any-
thing for granted in these areas. Also a means must be found for
stimulating the expression of reservations at policy levels, noting
that it is not easy to make these reservations operational.

The Secretary stated that if one looks at the problem of
intelligence in terms of the time factors involved he thought
one would find that even before October 14 our intelligence was.
\"pretty good\". He observed that except for two of the long-range
sites, overflights ten days earlier than October 14 would have
seen nothing

Mr. Murphy noted that the last observation of the Secretary
seemed to suggest exclusive dependence on photographs. To this
the Secretary observed that in its interim report the Board had
called attention to the need for re-enforcing classical intelli-
gence means. The Secretary said that he agreed with the Board's
point and that he considered it extremely important. He said the
Department is prepared to provide cover to the CIA, CIA, but that
other means must be developed as soon as possible; otherwise if
there is undue dependenceon diplomatic cover embarrasment's would
become greatly increased. He noted that already the United States
Government has had \"many problem cases\" involving CIA cover. He
noted also that a good rule is now being followed in this area,
a rule which precludes a CIA agent to target in his country of
assignment. The Secretary emphasized the view that our government

TOP SECRET

has \"under-played old fashioned espionage\". He observed that it
is easy to fly U-2s but that such flights inevitably bring up
international problems since they violate sovereignty; and there-
fore the Department of State welcomes the idea of beefing up
traditional espionage activities which are not dependent upon
diplomatic cover.

The Board next inquired as to whether the Secretary believed
that the interests and requirements of the intelligence community
were aggressively spoken for at the policy level during the pre-
October 14 period. He responded that the United States would have
been better off with more intensive air (U-2 plane) coverage during
the period beginning October 1, but at that time reports were
sketchy, there was the problem of the stand-down of the U-2 because
of the Chinat loss, weather conditions were not optimum, etc. Re-
verting to the principal question asked of him the Secretary expressed
the view that the Special NSC 5412/2 Group operated adequately and is
now operating adequately. He said that he is in touch with the Group
from time to time on its plans and he noted that on the matter of in-
telligence collecion flights we have run 2500 peripheral flights
around the Soviet Union and every one of them is to some degree
dangerous. He said that the President and he personally examine
the particularly sensitive flights that are proposed. He noted
that in the State Department intelligence requirements of the
community are accepted in this area and that the Department goes
along with the overwhelming number of flights proposed. He said
that in the case of Cuban overflights he personally made two sug-
gestions during the period in question. The first involved the step-
up of peripheral flights around Cuba as a cover for putting flights
over the island when we wanted to and he said that he had told the
OAS representatives about this, noting that the \"risks of strays\"
of such peripheral flights was \"very high\". His second suggestion
involved breaking up one or two proposed flights into segments of
four flights (the Board members were fully cognizant of this).
Mr. Gray made reference to the delays which necessarily resulted
from breaking the proposed mission into a four-segmented one. He
inquired of the Secretary as to whether he had been advised of the
fact that delays would necessarily result from his suggested amend-
ment of the mission. The Secretary replied in the negative.

At this point Dr. Land observed that there is not enough
personified pressure from intelligence; that a concentrated
statement of intelligence requirements and purposes should be
constantly served up to the policy level from suspicious intelli-
gence personalities and that these, of course, should be subject
to ultimate decision by the Secretary of State and others of high

TOP SECRET

authority. The Secretary took issue with a portion of Dr. Land's
statement on the grounds that it assumed that there is no one in
the intelligence community who has any policy responsibility.
The Secretary said that he thought this was incorrect because
the Director of Central Intelligence frequently acted as one
having policy responsibilities

The Secretary observed that while the intelligence needs are
great there are other requirements which the United States must
take into account and that these must all be balanced out. He
emphasized again at this point that overflying another country
in peacetime is a difficult thing.

The Secretary then reverted to the question of traditional
espionage and expressed the view that \"we have gotten a little
lazy on espionage\". He noted that during World War II excellent
espionage results were obtained by virtue of a \"most fabulous!
combination of blue bloods and thugs\". The Secretary favored
resumption now of this World War II practice

At this point Dr. Killian inquired of the Secretary as to
whether he was satisfied that Mr. McCone's report on Cuba dated
December 26th reflects a fair statement of the State Departments
views. The Secretary said he had been unable to examine the
report fully; that he had complete confidence in the relationships
which his Department has with Mr. McCone, but that he would take
exception to \"the juxta-position of things on the four-flight
matter\". Mr. Hilsman joined the Secretary in this view. The
Secretary urged that the Board members be as analytical as pos-
sible in examining the Cuba situation. He encouraged them to
remember the \"atmosphere of the times\". He hoped the Board would
be \"as precise as possible\" in examining the overflight matter
stating that \"if you think the U-2 is not serious, you are on the
wrong track\"

Mr. Gray indicated that it was the Board's understanding that
the President approved all overflights recommended, and he then
suggested that apparently there were some flights that were not
rejected, but neither were they made. To this the Secretary
stated that what ought to be looked at were the flights that
were laid on from September 20 to October 5 or 6. He noted that
during this period, following the September 19 estimate of the
intelligence community on Cuba, there was some delay in distrib-
uting reports from refugee and agent sources on the sightings fof
long-range missiles in Cuba. He again noted that just prior to
this period there was a loss of a Chinat operated U-2 over the

TOP SECRET

China mainland on September 9. On the latter point Dr. Langer
inquired whether the Secretary felt that flights over Cuba were
in the same category as flights over the Soviet Union or over
China. The Secretary responded in the negative noting that \"we
felt much greater freedom of action in the case of Cuba\". Mr.
Hillsman added on this point that the USIB felt that two U-2
flights a month over Cuba were adequate

The Secretary recalled that early in October he was requested
to authorize overflights based on indications of two specific sites
and he said he immediately approved.

Mr. Gray observed that there appeared to be some confusion as
to whether we had a policy of not overflying SA-2 sites, and
Secretary Johnson responded that the matter of overflying SA-2's
invariably came up in the Special Group but that he could not recall
any prohibition on overflying such sites. Secretary Johnson added
that in the Special Group he could not recall any kind of operation
ever being recommended where the atmosphere was as relaxed as it
was in the case of recommendations pertaining to the Cuba problem.

Mr. Hilsman stated that at the operational level there was
concern about losing a pilot over Cuba. Consequently a CORONA
Mission was programmed for Cuba from September 21 to September 24
Mr. Hilsman thought this concern over the loss of a man may have
been a factor which contributed to the low number of U-2 flights
flown.

The Secretary was asked whether he was satisfied with the
national estimating process and whether he considered that State
Department participation therein was provided for adequately.
The Secretary thought that State Department participation in the
preparation of national intelligence estimates was adequately.
provided for. He said that from the point of view of the policy
officer it is essential that he know what the intelligence people
think; that on the other hand the policy officer wants to avoid
taking the intelligence view as \"the Bible\", and he wishes to
find a way for the intelligence community to \"throw in contrary
indicators in their estimates in order that they might be flagged
for the policy maker.\"

The Secretary was then asked if he felt that the intelligence
community analytical, estimative and reporting functions in the
Cuba situation were hindered by international political consider-
ations or by preconceived views of \"Sovietologists\" regarding Soviet

TOP SECRET

intentions with respect to Cuba. The Secretary responded that
he did not believe that the \"Sovietologists\" did what has been
claimed. He did not believe that they had much influence on
estimates: He thought, however, he detected an insufficient
alertness on their part to the possibility that the estimates
of the intelligence community were were wrong. He expressed the
observation on this point that the direct indicators came in
after the September 19 estimate was prepared

The Secretary was next queried as to whether we are currently
informed in an adequate manner about Soviet objectives and activ-
ities in Cuba today. The Secretary responded that the principal
gap is our inability to prove the negative because of the absence
of on-site inspections. He said we are running overflights regu-
larly; that we have improved our cooperation with allied govern-
ments in Cuba; but that we do not know for certain what the Soviet
objectives are insofar as Cuba is concerned

When queried as to U. S. Government knowledge as to the
purpose of Mikoyan's stay in Cuba and as to what Mikoyan accom-
plished, the Secretary stated that he thought we know a great
deal about the Mikoyan mission. He noted that for ten days
Castro would not talk to Mikoyan. He said that we are getting
much better information regarding Castro and particularly Castro's
efforts in inspiring other Latin American countries. The Secre-
tary expressed the thought that the Soviet Union may be deciding
that Cuba is not the proper base from which to launch their Latin
American operations. He said rewarding gains have been made in
attempting to obstruct travel between Cuba and the Free World.
He conceded, however, that we do not have the Cuba-Russian plan,
adding that we have not penetrated the Cuban regime as well as he
hopes we might be able to later.

The Secretary was asked with reference to the Monroe Doctrine,
whether the Department of State has urged an aggressive intelligence
collection effort to define any new violation of the Doctrine. The
Secretary thought it would not be too profitable to concentrate on
this point and it would be more profitable to concentrate on the
Rio Pact. He agreed, however, that the Doctrine is violated by
the presence of the Marxist-Leninist system in the Western Hemis-
phere for he said there is no question whatever about the Soviet
presence in Cuba.

In conclusion the Secretary stated that he thought \"our
intelligence on Cuba today is not complete but it is not deficient

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT: CUBA (Review on 1/10/63 of Records of the
Special NSC 5412/2 Group)

On 1-10-63 the writer reviewed in the offices of Mr. Tom
Parrott, Executive Secretary, Special NSC 5412/2 Group, the
records of the Special Group which Mr. Parrott identified as
relating to considerations given by the Special Group to recon-
naissance and covert action operations with regard to Cuba.
(Attached hereto is a copy, supplied by Mr. Parrott from his
records, of a \"Memorandum for the Record\" dated 10/21/62 on
the subject \"Reconnaissance of Cuba\" which Mr. Parrött had
prepared for another purpose.)

There follows a detailed summary of the results of a
review made by the writer of the Cuba items referred to in
Mr. Parrott's summary memorandum; and of other items which
the writer reviewed in the Special Group records pertaining
to Cuba.

Minutes of Meetings of the Special Group
(Augmented) \"MONGOOSE\"

Minutes of the July 12, 1962 Meeting
of the Special Group (Augmented)

Those present were the Attorney General, Mr. Johnson,
Mr. Gilpatric, Mr. McCone, General Carter, General Lemnitzer,
General Lansdale, and Dr. Cline (for part of the meeting).

The Group noted a paper presented by the State Department,
member concerning \"Guideline for a post-Castro Political
Program.\"..

General Lansdale briefed the Group on the number of agents
now in Cuba, including legal residents, plus infiltrated teams.
It was decided that a CIA proposal, for resupply of agent teams
and possibly of resistance groups, should be deferred pending
a broader review of the entire situation. General Taylor
specified, however, that if an urgent need arose for air supply
at any time, the proposal could be made to the Special Group
(Augmented).

Mr. McCone and General Lansdale stated that a sizable
number of 'ntelligence reports were coming out of Cuba,
largely on political and economic matters. Mr. McCone emphasized

Handle Via TALENT-KEYHOLE Channels
Handle via BYEMAN
Control System

that no high-level penetration of the Cuban Government had been
achieved. In answer to a question from the Attorney General,
General Lansdale said that intelligence indicated that although
there was widespread dissatisfaction with Castro, there was
no rallying point for active opposition.

The Attorney General and Mr. Johnson emphasized the need
for an effort to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activi-
ties by the Castro regime in the Hemisphere, Mr. McCone noting
that such efforts to date had been fruitless.

Dr. Cline showed the Group the extent of reconnaissance.
coverage of Cuba. Mr. McCone emphasized that this program has
developed complete information on deployments and facilities
for the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and he particularly noted
that these missions have verified that there is sufficient
logistic support for a 75,000-man military force. \"No missile
sites have been found.\"

The Group agreed on a complete review of MONGOOSE toward
the end of July, with participation by the Secretaries of State
and Defense. General Taylor emphasized that in the preparation
for such review, there would be a need for summaries of results
obtained to date, of intelligence developed, and of future
alternatives opened to the United States (including possible
activities in other parts of Latin America).

Mr. Johnson said that the State Department is investigating
the possibilities for subsidizing Japanese purchases of Dominican
sugar to divert purchases from Cuba and thereby deprive Cuba
of a source of dollars, and Mr. Johnson asked that MONGOOSE
operational representatives lock into this further. Mr. McCone
said that the CIA could use unvouchered funds for this purpose;
but it would be illegal to use covert funds as a means of
evading the intent of Congress.

Minutes of the October 4, 1962 Meeting
of the Special Group (Augmented)

Those present for this meeting with regard to Operation
MONGOOSE were the Attorney General, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric,
General Lansdale, Mr. McCone, General Carter, and Mr. Wilson.

The Attorney General informed the Group that higher authority
was concerned about progress on the MONGOOSE program and felt
that more priority should be given to trying to mount sabotage
operations. The Attorney General wondered if a new look were

not required in view of the meager results obtained, especially
in the sabotage field, and he urged \"massive activity\" within
the entire MONGOOSE framework.

General Langdale thought that another attempt should be
made against the major target which had been the subject of
three unsuccessful missions and he said that six new missions
were in the planning stage.

Mr. Johnson said that the \"massive activity\" would have
to come from within, and he hoped to be able to present soon
to the Group a plan for giving Cuban exiles more of a free hand,
fully realizing that this will give additional visibility to
their activities. Mr. McCone reserved judgment on the feasi-
bility and desirability of such a program, and Mr. Johnson
agreed that he had reservations as well.

Mr. McCone said that he had received the impression
that although high levels of our Government wanted increased
activity, they still want to keep it at a low noise level,
but Mr. McCone did not believe this would be possible and he
felt that any sabotage would be blamed on the United States.
Mr. MeCone cited the enormous number of telephone calls
directed at CIA at the time the skin divers landed in east
Cuba, and the time that the Cuban exile students shot up the
apartment house. Mr. McCone therefore urged that responsible
officials be prepared to accept a higher noise level if they
want to get on with operations.

The Attorney General, n partial rebuttal, said that the
reasons people had such concern were. (a) the fact that the skin.
c.vers were Americans, and (b) the fact that the

Chairman reported on a number of items including the following.

The Chairman advised that on the previous day Mr. Murphy
had informed Mr. Coyne that he had received a telephone call at
his offices in New York from the Director of Central Intelligence.
Mr. McCone indicated to Mr. Murphy that the President had talked
with him about the Board's final report on the Cuba situation
dated February 4; that the President had shown Mr. McCone a copy
of the report, indicating that no other distribution was being
made of the report at this time. Mr. Murphy advised that Mr. McCone
was quite emotional in discussing the Board's report, stating that
if the Board is going to insist on submitting the report, the top
five people in CIA, including Mr. McCone, would have to resign
from the Agency. Mr. Murphy pointed out to Mr. McCone that the
report had already been formally submitted to the President by the
Board. Mr. McCone then expressed to Mr. Murphy his concern and
disagreement with the references in the report to the failure of
intelligence. Mr. Murphy advised Mr. McCone that in his judgment,
and indeed he thought in the judgment of all of the Board members,
there was in fact a failure of intelligence and it was the duty of
the Board to so state in its report to the President. Mr. Murphy
expressed the view that the report was really mild. Mr. McCone
indicated that even in retrospect there were only about seven of
the thirty-five indicators listed in the report of offensive mis-
siles in Cuba which might be considered valid. Mr. Murphy reiter-
ated that Mr. McCone was quite emotional in discussing the above
matter, saying if the report stood it could lead to resignations
from DIA as well as CIA. At this point e mentioned to Mr. McCone
that he was in New York at a meeting with others and didn't like
discussing this aspect on the telephone and suggested they discuss
the matter further when they next met.

Moving to another subject, the DCI said that he was concerned
about the prospects of a future nuclear explosion in Communist China,
and to a lesser degree he was concerneu about the prospects of such
a development in Israel. He thought that the prospects of these
developments brings up a most serious problem from the standpoint
of psychological effect upon other nations should these develop-
ments take place, although there does not seem to be anything we
can do about them.

Insofar as U-2 overflights of Communist China by Chinese
Nationalist pilots are concerned, these missions are being flown
in \"Category 3\" weather (instead of Category 2 weather conditions
involving a maximum of 25% cloud cover) because there is a need for
frequent missions. The DCI said that although these missions have
not produced evidence of a reactor in operation in Communist China,
there are some indications, e.g., a test area in Tibet, and the
President has been alerted to this possibility.

The DCI said that somewhat of a problem is presented in Israel.
Although we are close to the Israeli government, it appears to be
withholding information on the extent of its nuclear activities. As
in the past France is assisting Israel and the French government is
helping the Israeli government build a nuclear reactor at the pre-
sent time. In a building next to the reactor there is an installa-
tion which could be a chemical separation facility, but the Israelis
deny that this is the case. Moreover, the DCI pointed out, the
Israelis refuse to submit to international safeguards prescribed by
the international atomic energy agency. Mr. McCone stated that he
believes that the development of a nuclear weapon capability by
Israel would have most serious effects on countries of the Middle
East and, therefore, Mr. McCone is ready to repeat recommendations
which he previously made to President Eisenhower that unless Israel
Joins in the international safeguards we should take certain econ-
omic reprisals against Israel. Mr. McCone observed that our govern-
ment permits tax deductions on Israeli bonds, and we have given Israei
billions of dollars in aid. Despite this the Israelis could well be
proceeding without full knowledge on our part on an atomic energy
program which could trigger grave trouble in the Middle East.

Finally, Mr. McCone reported that CIA has concluded that our
policy on intelligence collection within the United States is wrong
and particularly as it applies to Soviet Bloc Embassies and to tele-
phone intercept coverage as well as exploitation of official Soviet
Bloc personnel in the United States. Mr. McCone stated that he was
going to propose that the CIA intensify its activities on these
matters or that the FBI be directed to intensify their activities
in these areas. He noted that basically this is an FBI responsibility
but that it is his own view that this responsibility could more
properly be carried out by the CIA. Mr. Clifford inquired as to

whether the DCI would not encounter difficulty in trying to get
this function transferred from FBI to CIA, and Mr. McCone responded
that he does not care who carries out the responsibility as long as
it is appropriately done and he added that he believes the CIA is
qualified to do it. Dr. Land observed that this activity does not
belong with the FBI; that coverage of an espionage agent is one thing
but that exploiting Soviet Bloc coverage for intelligence collection
purposes is quite another.

Mr. McCone advised that there is another dimension to this
problem which involves increasing the number of CIA intelligence
representatives in Moscow. He noted that CIA has only three em-
ployees in the Moscow Embassy. He pointed out that in Washington,
D. C. and New York City out of a total of 392 Soviet official rep-
resentatives CIA has identified 176 as intelligence officers of the
KGB and GRU, a proportion of 45%. He added that 23% of the Soviet
official representatives in London are intelligence officers and
in France the figure is 36%.

Before departing the meeting Mr. McCone displayed to the Poard
a photograph demonstrating the success of the latest infrared photog-
raphy taken of terrain from an altitude of 3500 feet.

Dr. Killian asked the DCI if the Board could have a copy of the
new draft NRO agreement, and in response to this the DCI made a
copy of the draft available later on in the day. Hefore Mr. Mc Cone
left the meeting he suggested that if the Board had any questions
regarding the terms of the draft NRO agreement it would be appropri-
ate to raise them with the Secretary of Defense or Mr. Gilpatric or
Mr. McCone himself, rather than raising such questions at working
levels at the Defense Department or the CIA. The DCI said that he
did not want to inhibit in any way the discussions that the Board
might want to have at any level at any time, and he noted that
Dr. Land was to confer with Secretary Gilpatric the following day.
(Dr. Land assured the DCI that the scheduled meeting was to be con-
fined strictly to a technical discussion.)

This concluded the DCI's meeting with the Board and he and
Mr. Kirkpatrick departed the meeting at 12:30p.m.

At 12:30 p.m., Mr. Arthur Lundahl of the NPIC, and Mr. William
Tidwell joined the Board meeting. (Before beginning their presen-
tations, Mr. Lundahl answered a question from a Board member by
stating that the NPIC moved into its new quarters at the Naval Gun
Factory on January 1, 1963, and it occupies the entire facility
except for the occupancy of a part of one floor by the U. S. Geo-
logical Survey.) Mr. Tidwell proceeded to give the Board a briefing
on the internal situation in Cuba. In essence Mr. Tidwell said that
Cuba is a good example of Latin American Communism in action. The
Castro regime has established very good security, but the internal
political situation is considerably messed up in a controversy
between the Castroites and the old-line members of the Communist
Party of Cuba.

The sugar crop in Cuba is off one-third this year. The
country will have a hard time economically next year and the
Soviets will have to provide further substantial aid. Although
the rationing program is difficult to enforce in Cuba, the people
have by no means reached a starvation level. Bloc shipping carries
most of the imports into the island, and non-Bloc shipping is neg-
ligible.

Because of the efficiency of the Castro internal security
program, any significant organized revolt efforts have been pre-
vented. Fifty per cent of the refugees who were interrogated
during January thought that as of last summer there was a good
poet
chance of a successful revolution against Castro. After theters liem
Soviets reached a peak of introducing personnel and armaments
in July, only five per cent thought that a revolt could succeed.
When the Russians subsequently withdrew strategic missiles from
Cuba fifteen per cent of the refugees thought that a revolt might
succeed.

Some 1500 students from other Latin American countries have
been given guerilla warfare training in Cuba. Castro's radio prop-
aganda is urging other Latin American countries to follow the Cuban
example. In answer to a question by Dr. Killian, Mr. Tidwell sald
that the Cubans are Jamming U. S. radio broadcasts beamed at Latin
America, but Mr. Tidwell had no information to indicate that our
Government was jamming the Cuban broadcast activity. Mr. Tidwell
then summarized information on the Cuban and Soviet orders of
battle, along the lines of information contained in Current Intel-
ligence Bulletins.

Dr. Baker raised a rhetorical question as to whether the Sov-
lets were not in fact establishing in Cuba a command-and-control post
for use in the event of a military offensive against the Western Hem-
isphere, and Dr. Baker asked if it were not true that never before

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE
March 14, 1963
Subject Board Meeting with the President, Marcin 9, 1963

At 10:00 A.M., on March 9, 1963, the Board met with the
President in the Cabinet Room of the White House for the
purpose of presenting the Board's report and recommendations
growing out of its completed review of the foreign intel-
ligence aspects of the Soviet military build-up in Cuba.
Those present were Messrs. Killian, Doolittle, Land, Langer,
Gray, Clifford, Baker,Murphy, and Messrs. Coyne and Ash.
Mr. McGeorge Bundy was also present.

Dr. Killian informed the President that the Board had
recommendations to present based on the Cuba episode. He
recalled to the President that the Board had submitted two
previous reports, one - an interim report dated December 28,
1962, containing recommendations of such urgency that the
Board forwarded them prior to completing its review of Cuba;
and a more comprehensive report dated February 4, 1963, in
which the Board set forth its complete findings based on a
detailed investigation of the Cuba situation from the stand-
point of foreign intelligence coverage. Dr. Killian said
that the recommendations which the Board was now presenting
should be considered in the light of the two previous reports,
particularly the report dated February 4, 1963.

Dr. Killian then presented the Board's recommendations,
reading from the written report which was forwarded to the
President under date of March 8, 1963. In reading this report
to the President, Dr. Killian directed attention to the fact
that most of the recommendations which were being presented
were an outgrowth of the Board's study of Cuba, but that two
of the recommendations dealt with major problems affecting
the over-all foreign intelligence effort.

Dr. Killian stated Fecommendations 1 thr gh 4 of the
March 8, 1963 report.

Following Dr. Killian's statement of Recommendation 4
regarding low-level aerial surveillance flights over Cuba,
the President observed that such flights had not been suspended
but were being reserved for coverage of particularly critical
intelligence targets should the situation warrant, as, for
example, the February 9, 1963 low-level mission. Mr. Bundy
TOP SECRET

NW185
NW 881328

TOP SECRET

commented that two or three important targets in Cuba have
been identified since the February 9 low-level mission, but
the approval of low-level coverage of these new targets is
being held in abeyance pending the completion of efforts by
Attorney Donovan to obtain the release of some twenty Ameri-
cans held prisoner in Cuba, including three individuals whom
the United States is particularly desiro of returning to
this country. The President asked for elaboration on the
Board's recommendation for the development of long focal
length cameras to be used in U-2 aircraft. Dr. Land explained
that some time ago an effort was made to develop such a camera
but the earlier version was not a success, and the development
efforts were suspended because there was not an immediate
need for a camera having this particular capability, although
at the present time such a camera would be most useful in
covering such Cuban targets as caves and other installations
suspected of being used for concealment of materials and
equipment. Dr. Land thought that the cost of developing a
long focal length camera would be relatively inexpensive in
comparison to the cost of such projects as DISCOVERER.

Dr. Killian then presented Recommendations 5 through 7
of the March 8 report.

When Dr. Killian stated Recommendation 8 concerning proー
posals for and the monitoring of unique intelligence operations,
Mr. Bundy made the comment that the Special Group fully agrees
with this recommendation and has instituted procedures designed
to assure that the Special Group 13 informed regarding opera-
tional delays encountered in the course of carrying out surveil-
lance missions previously approved by the Special Group.

Dr. Killian then stated Recommendation ll of the Board's
report dated March 8.

In connection with Dr. Killian's statement of Recommenda-
tion 12 on the need for improving national intelligence
estimates, Mr. Bundy reiterated the point which the Board had
made to the effect that the present system for producing
national intelligence estimates is being run by the originators
of the system, and the present mechanism for producing such
estimates is a \"founders' body.\" Dr. Langer said it is true
that the estimative group has a highly trained staff which has
been in existence for many years, but the Board has not yet
conducted a specific study of its operations. Dr. Killian
summarized the tenor of this recommendation of the Board by
saying that a monolithic point of view is not necessarily the
best estimate

Turning next to two recommendations of a general nature,
Dr. Killian stated Recommendations 13 and 14 of the March 8
report dealing with the subjects of scientific intelligence
resources and the effective organization and management of
the National Reconnaissance Office.

Following Dr. Killian's presentation, the President
expressed his appreciation for the Board's efforts and said
that he would follow through on the recommendations which
had been made.

Referring to the thirty-five intelligence reports con-
taining indicator-type data which were dealt with in the
Board's February 4 report, the President observed that these
indications were \"pretty thin.\" The President observed that
first there was the Berlin Wall incident and then the Cuba
development, and in retrospect the President found it extra-
ordinary that our Government had not obtained more advance
information with respect to those situations.

The President said that we should have accomplished a
penetration of the Castro regime at a relatively high level
in the Cuban Government.

Dr. Land stated that he and Dr. Langer had been engaged
in recent discussions of Dr. Land's concern about the manner
in which our national intelligence estimates are produced.
Dr. Land thought that, under the present system, it seemed
that no meaning could be derived from particular facts or
information unless the information could be fitted into patterns
which the estimators already had in mind. The Board is there-
fore suggesting, Dr. Land said, that the CIA see if there is
not a need for trained professionals who are not only open-
minded, but whose careers are devoted to fitting intelligence
information into all possible patterns. In the Cuba situation,
Dr. Land pointed out, there was a fixed pattern in the minds
of estimators to the effect that refugee reports concerning
offensive missiles were in reality reports concerning surface-
to-air missiles and installations. Or. Land said that the
Board was not proposing a policy under which the President
would review raw intelligence reports, but the Board felt
that the estimators should form the various alternative
patterns which can be reliably derived from an analysis of
intelligence, in order that policy makers may have the benefit
of such alternatives. Dr. Langer said that on the other hand
the estimators have to act on rationality and cannot assume
that the enemy is acting on an irrational basis.

The President said that looking back on the Cuba situa-
tion it is now apparent that the SAM sites were related to
the deployment of offensive missiles. The President observed
that there has not been made, to his knowledge, an analysis
of the assumption under which the Soviets operated in Cuba,
and it would be of some academic interest, at least, to know
why the Soviets did not use their SA-2's against our over-
flight operations. Dr. Land observed that if the Soviet
camouflage teams in Cuba had been up to schedule along with
the Soviet schedule for deployment of offensive missiles,
we would not have found the missiles, and it was by the grace
of God that we did find them.

Mr. Clifford, referring to earlier references to the
need for clandestine agent penetration of Cuba, said that the
Board had concluded that the absence of clandestine coverage
is attributable to a lack of imagination on the part of our
intelligence elements over a long period of years during which
we enjoyed close relations with the Cuban Government. There-
fore, Mr. Clifford said, the Board is concerned about the
adequacy of such coverage at the present time in places like
Brazil and Argentina. Mr. Murphy observed that originally the
CIA set out to use U. S. diplomatic establishments as a cover
for CIA intelligence operations only for an initial period,
but these cover arrangements became permanent. Mr. Murphy
noted that in discussion with the Board the Director of Central
Intelligence has said that it is difficult to achieve deep
cover for clandestine agent operations, and while Mr. Murphy
agrees that this task is of course difficult, he has seen no
evidence that concerted efforts have been made, for example,
to penetrate the Castro regime. Mr. Clifford recalled that
on the preceding day Mr. McCone had directed the Board's
attention to the fact that whereasombe CIA has three operatives
in Moscow, the Soviet Union has/153 Intelligence officer's in
the United States. Dr. Killian informed the President that
the Board lays great stress on the need for a real effort to
increase our clandestine agent operations.

Referring again to the reports and findings of the Board,
the President said that one problem is reflected in the instance
where the Secretary of State had recommended that a particular
U-veillance mission over Cuba be broken up into four over-
flight missions. The President said he was not suggesting that
this was not a prudent suggestion by the Secretary of State,
but that this made him conscious of the fact that there is
perhaps a lack of expertise on the part of policy makers with
respect to certain intelligence operations. The President
commented that one flight was flown over an area where the
aircraft could well have been shot down.

The President then referred to the fact that Dr. Kiilian
was retiring as Chairman of the Board in May. The President
expressed deep appreciation for the work which Dr. Killian
has done and the valuable contribution which Dr. Killian has
made to the country. The President recalled that the Board
has conducted three post-mortems on intelligence situations,
and that these efforts of the Board have been most useful,
particularly in the case of Cuba. The President added that
he wished to express his appreciation for the effective manner
in which the Board has carried out its duties in the past.
He stated that the Board's contribution has been most valuable.
In addition to its being valuable to the President, the Roard
has also contributed in an important way through the awareness
which it has created in the intelligence community of its
continuing operations and continuing review of intelligence
activities. The President said that he was very much indebted
to all of the Board members and is hopeful that the Board will
continue its present operations for he considered them to be
invaluable.

Dr. Killian expressed his gratitude for the President's
comments, and then said that, as a footnote to the Board's
present report, the members wished to say to the President
that he has a right to expect high quality performance on the ly
part of the intelligence community, and the Board suggests
that the President see fit to emphasize to the intelligencetton
community the necessity for producing adequate information.

The President then referred to current criticisms and
inquiries which have been received from various quarters
concerning the role of the Government in the Bay of Pigs
invasion, and the President wondered whether the Board felt
that the Administration should be more responsive to such
criticisms and inquiries. Mr. Murphy commented that we
would be well advised to follow the practice of Prime Minister
Macmillan who responds to such criticism and inquiries with
a statement to the effect that we do not discuss our intel-
ligence activities in public.

Dr. Killian assured the President that members of the
Board feel that to the greatest extent possible the Adminis-
tration should refrain from making intelligence disclosures
with respect to the Bay of Pigs incident. Mr. Clifford thought
that the situation had been summed up humorously and accurately
in a recent statement by Congressman Mahon who questioned
whether the real problem was a lack of intelligence information
or, on the other hand, a lack of intelligence on the part of
self-appointed critics. The President stated that he too was
impressed with Congressman Mahon's statement and, in fact,
after the statement appeared in the press, he called Congressman
Mahon and commended him on its content.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
SUBJECT. Interim Report to the President by the
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board, dated December 28, 1962

We have set down the several paragraphs of the subject report followed
by our comments.

1. The recommendation of the Board. Great uncertainties about
present Soviet efforts in Cuba indicate the necessity of a continuing aggressive
intelligence effort to equip our policy makers with timely and adequate infor-
mation to meet the possibility of continuing Soviet confrontation in Cuba. We
must resist any tendency warda a let down in our intelligence effort against
Cuba in the wake of intelligence successes resulting from our military re-
connaissance missions over the island. In making this observation we are
mindful that in a quite different atmosphere the Central Intelligence Agency
did not mount effective clandestine intelligence collection operations in Cuba
for an eight-month period following the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Comment. We agree with the principle stated in the first sentence
of the recommendation and the need to continue an aggressive intelligence
effort against Cuba. This view was advanced by the Director of Central
Intelligence at the meeting of the Fresident's Board on December 7, 1962 and
again at the meeting of the Board on December 28. The DCI informed the
Board at these meetings that it was important that there be extensive intelli
gence operations to find out the trend of developmente in Cuba and that efforts.
to get agents into Cuba were being intensified. It should be noted, however,
that in clandestine intelligence operations the allocation of additional manpower
and funds to a task, although helpful, does not necessarily assure a corre-
sponding improvement in production or accomplishment.

Since early 1962 the CIA has increased its effort to collect intelli-
gence information on Cuba. The operations for this purpose have been

conducted vigorously as a matter of urgency. Following the misfortune at
the Bay of Pigs, there was a decrease in the clandestine effort against Cuba.
Even so, from April 15, 1961 through December 1961 the Clandestino.
Services of CIA disseminated 608 information reports on Cuba,
of which 406 reports came from sources inside Cuba. The Contact Division/00
of CIA disseminated 1764 reports on Cuba during the period April 8 to December
1961. During the period from April 1961 through December 1961, seventeen
resident agents wore recruited in Cuba and are still active. In addition, five
resident assets, two with sub-assets, recruited prior to April 1961, were
maintained during this same eight-month period and are still active. There
were other recruitments and numerous attempts that failed.

The period of sixty days following the Bay of Pigs invasion was a
difficult one for the Agency. The Taylor Committee, composed of General
Taylor, the Attorney General, Mr. Allen Dulles, and Admiral Burke, began
its survey of the Bay of Pigs operation on April 22 and continued throughout
May and June. This Committee took much of the time and effort of precisely
those people responsible for Cuban operations, both in Miami and in Washington.
There were demands for written papers and documents, as well as personal
interviews of key people. Changes in the top echelon of the Agency, anticipated
during the summer and implemented in the fall of 1961, had their effect on
Cuban operations. While it was generally agreed and understood that cur
effort to collect information must continue, specific policy guidance was not
given to CLA and funds necessary to carry out expanded programs were not
approved by higher authority until August 4, 1961.

The newly appointed DCI, following his review of the situation in
mid-December 1961, directed that the effort against Cuba be intensified.
This led to the establishment, on March 8, 1962, of Task Force Was a
separate entity within the Agency for the purpose of mounting a maxlinum
effort, particularly in the collection of information, against Cuba. As of
March 8, 1962 the Task Force had a personnel strength in the field and at
Headquarters of 335. As of January 1, 1963, the total number of personnel
devoting full time to the efforts of the Task Force was 594. Of this 594, 147
wore from other agencies and other components of the Agency outside the
Clandestine Services. Total financial obligations during fiscal year 1962
were $17, 291, 000. Estimated obligations for fiscal year 1963 totaled
$28,200,000, but now have been scaled to $24,000,000 with the final figure
dependent upon future policy.

2. The recommendation of the Board. We recommend intensified, hard-
hitting efforts to increase our capability for obtaining significart intelligence
through clandestine collection opcrations (espionage). Despite noteworthy
intelligence results obtainable through scientific and technical means, we still
have as great a need as ever for carefully selected, hurman-resource espiomge
operations professionally executed on the basis of the soundest planning judgments
and the most competent target selection processes which the intelligence can.
munity can achieve. The Cuban experience is a case in point, for we now have
few meaningful espionage amets on the island and without such asats we have
little hope of developing the kind and degree of hard intelligence which is required
on such critical matters as: a) the plans and intentions of the Soviet Governinent
and the Castro regime for future operations within Cuba or for future operations
launched from Cuba against other Latin American countries; b) the alleged con-
cealment of offensive weapons in caves or other locations which are incapable of
being probed by technical intelligence means; and c) the actual numbers of Soviet
troops in Cuba, their precise deployments, equipments, activities and objectives.

In numerous countries our serious lack of clandestine agent resources
is compounded by heavy reliance on the use of official cover as a cloak for our
Intelligence-gathering activities abroad. Again, Cuba provides animportant
lesson. When the rupture of diplomatic relations in January 1961 forced the
recall of U. S. intelligence personnel who had been operating under diplomatic
Cover provided by the American Embassy in Havana, we did not have remaining
on the island and we still do not have adequate. deep cover, clandestine
agent networks on which to rely. Priority U. S. intelligence requirements in
Latin America and elsewhere cail for intensive efforts by the appropriate
intelligence agencies of the Government to lay the groundwork for dep-cover,
clandestine intelligence operations which are not dependent upon official cover
and which will not be affected by a breach in diplomatic relations.**

Events of the past few years suggest that drematic advances in
advanced intelligence methods such as high altitude and satellite photography
have obscured the role of human beings as collection and transmission inedia,
trained and equipped with the most sophisticated technical aids, and supported
by essential logistics and communications. We are gravely concerned about
the progressive low of our capability in the field of clandestine intelligence
operations and in our view there is a need for the preparation of new plans for
the recruiting, training and equipping of agents for comprehensive clandestine
intelligence collection, particularly in Latin America.

* The need for clandestine intelligence coverage has been emphasized previously
in reports of advisory bodies constituted by the President to review our foreign

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE
SUBJECT: President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board Meeting,
June 4, 1964.

This regularly scheduled meeting of the Board convened at 9:00 a.m.,
June 4, 1964, in the Board offices, 297 Executive Office Building. Previously
scheduled as a 2-day meeting, it was compressed into one day in order to
accommodate other commitments and to permit the holding of Board Panel sessions
on the following day. Present were Chairman Clifford and Messrs. Pace, Murphy,
Langer and Gray; and J. Patrick Coyne and A. R. Ash. General Doolittle was
unable to attend because of transportation difficulties in Alaska. Messrs
Baker and Land were unavoidably late in arriving, and upon their arrival later
in the morning received a fill-in from the Chairman concerning the matters
which had been discussed up to that point.

Chairman Clifford pointed out that the business of this meeting was
confined to major subjects of particular importance: (1) recont developments
following the submission to the President of the Board's May 2 report and
recommendations on the National Reconnaissance Program (2) the recent discovery
of extensive microphone installations in the U. S. Embassy, Moscow a most
serious penetration which had prompted the Chairman to request a Board Panel
study immediately upon his learning of the discovery, and (3) the subject of
acquiring intelligence on Communist China, a problem highlighted by remarks of
the Secretary of Defense when he was recently visited by Chairman Clifford,
Dr. Baker and Mr. Coyne at which time Secretary McNamara expressed deep con-
cern over the absence of meaningful intelligence on Chinese capabilities,
intentions and activities (Mr. McNamara said that the USIB is not adequate for
his purposes in this regard; he has to make decisions without the benefit of
adequate intelligence support; if he can't get help from the USIB and CIA he
will attempt to get the required intelligence through other sources; and he
would welcome any assistance the Board might provide as a means of resolving
this intelligence collection problem.)

With reference to the Board's report on the National Reconnaissance
Program, Mr. Clifford said that it had gone to the White House on May 2.
Thereafter two appointments with the President had to be cancelled, thereby
preventing discussion of the report with the President. Accordingly,
Mr. Clifford suggested to Mr. McGeorge Bundy that the matter was urgent.
The same day, Mr. Bundy took up the report with the President, with the
resulting decision that Mr. Bundy would obtain the views and comments of the
Secretary of Defense and of the DCI, Mr. McCone, concerning the Board's report
and recommendations, in order that further consideration might be given by
the President.

At Mr. Clifford's request, Mr. Coyne summarized the comments which had
been submitted on the NRP report by the two officials in response to Mr. Bundy's
memorandum. The June 2, 1964, response from Deputy Secretary Vance expressed
concurrence of the Department of Defense in the report and its readiness to
carry out the recommendations when instructed to do so. However, in his May 28
memorandum to Mr. Bundy, the DCI reported that he found it difficult to distill
his thoughts in time for a written expression of views for immediate consideration;
that he would be able to discuss the matter orally with the Board at this meeting;
that his written views could be submitted by June 15; and that meanwhile he
intended to discuss with the Director, NRO, any management problems the latter
might have in mind.

Chairman Clifford thought it gratifying that the Defense Department had
accepted the Board's NRP report and recommendations in toto, and he referred to
informally received indications that the Department of Defense is anxious to
get on with the actions proposed in the Board's report. Noting that the pre-
liminary reply from the DCI was noncommital, Mr. Clifford thought it best that
the Board not engage in a discussion of the NRP report with the DCI when he
joined the Board meeting later in the day. Mr. Clifford observed that the Board
had studied the subject in depth; it had reached conclusions and made recommenda-
tions to the President; Mr. Bundy had asked for comments to the President by
Messrs. McNamara and McCone; and it was desirable to keep the matter in that
channel, rather than reopening discussions with the DCI at this Board meeting.

(Dr. Baker arrived at the Board meeting at this point.)

At the Chairman's request, Mr. Coyne summarized for the Board the reported
successes and failures of satellite reconnaissance photographic missions since
January 1, 1964 (4 successful missions; 3 failures) and the NRO mission schedule
for the remainder of the year. (He also referred to the NRO report that OXCART
has been flown at Mach 3.2 at 81,700 feet.)

Chairman Clifford noted that the manner in which the NRO reports on its
satellite missions leaves much to be desired. He felt that the Board should ask
for more meaningful reports from NRO, reflecting the number of missions scheduled,
the number that were launched, how many succeeded, and how many failed anú why.
Also Mr. Clifford thought that the Board should be fully informed on how the
USIB determines that the NRO has a capability to meet specified intelligence
requirements through the launching of \"X\" number of missions over a given future
period, e.g., \"two flights per month\".

Dr. Baker added that no one has efficiently organized the process of
analyzing the photographic take from satellite missions, for the purpose of
identifying intelligence targets which warrant further \"point search\" on future.
missions.

Turning to the matter of the technical penetration of the U. S. Embassy,
Moscow, Mr. Clifford recalled that he had asked the Board's Baker Panel and
Mr. Coyne to go into the subject immediately upon Mr. Clifford's learning of the
discovery of the first of the 41 microphones on April 23. He noted that
Mr. Bundy had asked Dr. Jerome Wiesner to make an on-the-scene assessment of
the penetration during Dr. Wiesner's visit to Moscow this past week on other

business, and he would join the Board meeting later in the day to report on
that assessment. Also, Mr. Clifford noted, the Board meeting would later
be joined by Dr. Tordella of NSA, Mr. Bannerman of CIA who chairs the USIB
Security Committee, and Mr. Gentile who serves as Director of Security in
the State Department.

Mr. Coyne summarized for Board members the highlights of the discovery
of the technical penetration of the Enbassy in Moscow, with indications that
the 41 microphones, the 3 coaxial cables, the wiring, and the fixed antenna
in the wall, have all been in place since 1952 when the Soviet Union completed
construction on the Embassy building in preparation for U. S. occupancy which
took place in 1953.

(Dr. Land arrived at the Board meeting at this point.)

Mr. Coyne drew attention to the fact that the microphone installations
included coverage of the Embassy code room. He referred in this connection
to the NSA damage evaluation dealt with in Tab C of the June 1 \"Preliminary
Damage Assessment\" which had just been received from the USIB Security Conanittee.
Mr. Coyne thought it regrettable that the State Department security people in
Moscow had cut the cables upon discovery of the microphone and related in-
stallations. Mr. Clifford agreed, recalling that when he arst learned of the
development from Mr. Coyne he urged that efforts he made to keep the discovered
items in place for the time being. Mr. Coyne said that this was urged on the
State Department but certain State Department officials thought the Board was
getting into operations, and a cable went out to Ambassador Kohler instructing
him to proceed and to lodge a protest with the Soviet government.

Mr. Coyne called Board members' attention to the summary of U. S.
Ambassadors' assessments (appearing in the USIB's Security Committee report)
which discounted the likelihood of damage to the U. S. from the technical
penetration of the Embassy.

Mr. Coyne pointed to the 1962 report of the Soviet defector who informed
CIA (which in turn informed the State Department) that the Embassy in Moscow
was bugged at various strategic locations. Mr. Coyne said that he had recently
asked State Department representatives what had been done on the basis of the
defector's 1962 report, and it appeared that no action had been taken by State
Department security technicians until recent digging operations were begun
following receipt of a report from a second Soviet defector early in 1964 that
microphones were in place in specific Embassy office locations. Mr. Coyne
also related the substance of his inquiries made of the State Department Chief
of Communications (Mr. Coffey) in the summer of 1963 when Khrushchev boasted to
Governor Harriman that he could produce a copy of a message which Ambassador
Kohler had sent to Washington regarding the U. S. position on Soviet pipe-line
negotiations with West Germany (Mr. Coffey's finding was to the effect that
no communications penetration could in fact be established).

Chairman Clifford expressed the view that there appeared to have been
raised in this discussion a fundamental question to which the Board might
well give its attent:lon 1.e., the overall attitude of the U. S. Government
toward counterintelligence, intelligence and the security of intelligence
matters. In this instance the Board had raised an important point in urging
that the penetration cables not be cut precipitously when discovered in the
Embassy, but the Board's urging was ignored. Mr. Clifford thought it appropriate
to determine just what forum does have cognizance in such important developments
as this one, 1. e., whether the USIB, or the Special 5412 Group, or other group,
has cognizance in these matters. Mr. Coyna read from NSC 5618 the policy re-
quirement that upon the discovery of listening devices, U. S. agencies are
: required to obtain high level determinations as to whether the devices should
be left in place for purposes of exploitation against the foreign intelligence
service involved.

Mr. Gray expressed concern about the possibility that the Moscow penetration
enabled the Soviets to learn what the U. S. was doing and about to do with regard
to Cuba in the Fall of 1962.

In answer to the Chairman's inquiry, Mr. Coyne reported that U. S. security
technicians do not today have a device capable of detecting a shielded cable
microphone imbedded 7 inches in the wall, as in the case of the 41 microphones
found in the U. S. Embassy, Moscow.

At 10:30 a.m. the Board meeting was joined by Mr. Bannerman of CIA
(Chairman of the USB Security Committee); Dr. Tordella, Deputy Director of NSA;
and Mr. Marvin Gentile, since March 1964, Director of the Office of Security,
U. S. Department of State. Mr. Clifford indicated the Board's interest in being
fully informed on the facts relating to the recent discovery of the penetration
in Moscow; the effectiveness of detection methods used at the Embassy previously
and those available at present; and the information which led to the recent
discoveries. Mr. Bannerman said that he could speak to the assessment of damage,
leaving to Mr. Gentile the discussion of the history and effectiveness of tests
to detect the presence of listening devices.

Referring to the USIB Security Committee's June 1 \"Preliminary Damage
Assessment\", Mr. Bannerman explained that Army, Navy and Air Force had conducted
interviews of personnel formerly assigned to the Embassy (now scattered) but
the inquiries were along the line of possible compromise of military attache type
of information, exclusive of the compromise of communications. On the other
hand, State Department interviews of personnel previously assigned at the Embassy
were made on the assumption that the Soviets had access to conversations and to
communications as well. (Army, Navy and Air Force are still in the process of
reviewing their old traffic in an effort to see whether their communications
were compromised.) Mr. Bannerman pointed to the State Department conclusion that
no damage to U. S. foreign policy can be detected as a result of the bugging of
our Embassy in Moscow. Mr. Bannerman pointed to the conclusion in the USIB
assessment to the effect that the Soviets did get information on operations,
and on military attache movements, and on the intelligence targets in which they
were interested. He pointed out that the agencies report that important decisions
were not discussed aloud, but in whispers or in the form of written notes.

(Chairman Clifford thought it remarkable that such precautions would have
been consistently maintained over such a long period of 11 years.)

In answer to Mr. Coyne's inquiry, Mr. Bannerman said that the Security
Committee's preliminary assessment had been \"noted\" by the USIB and USIB had
approved the recommendations, with the request that the Security Committee
complete a final assessment.

Mr. Bannerman said that it is most difficult to attempt to assess the
damage to U. S. interests resulting from the Moscow penetration. First is the
task of identifying information to which the Soviets may have obtained access.
The next task is to try and find instances in which Soviet reaction provides
evidence that a compromise of information was effected. Moreover, since this
was a Soviet intelligence operation, the information obtained by the intelligence
operators would not be passed on to Soviet political desks or to Soviet bloc
allies without attributing to some source other than the technical penetration.
Dr. Langer thought that, nevertheless, all such information obtained by technical
penetration of the U. S. Embassy would be reviewed and utilized where possible by the
Soviet government. Mr. Bannerman acknowledged that this would be the case, but he
emphasized the difficulty in observing and identifying Soviet reactions and actions
as being based on compromised U. S. information or communications. Dr. Land
expressed the view that it is dangerous to assume that our information' was not
compromised because we cannot observe specific Soviet reactions to such informa-
tion. Dr. Baker wondered whether the assessment of the 3 U. S. Ambassadors
that no damage was done is in essence a finding that intelligence is worthless,
is not needed, or is not used when it is obtained.

Chairman Clifford asked whether it is possible to relate compromised
U. S. information to Soviet actions with respect to Cuba. Mr. Bannerman referred
to the USIB Security Committee assessment on that point. Mr. Gentile pointed
out that by 1962 an acoustically shielded conference room and an electronically
shielded code room had been inscalled in the Embassy, and in addition the
practice has always been followed of writing out sensitive information. Mr. Gray
thought that the State Department assessment referred to in the Conclusions of
the USIB Security Committee report should be amended by adding to the effect
that \"or, if the information was compromised, it was used by the Soviets with
such skill as to conceal whether in fact the information was compromised\".

Mr. Pace wondered whether information obtained by the Soviets through
this technical penetration of our Embassy might not have resulted in the
Soviet identification of any defectors serving as intelligence agents for the
U. S. Mr. Bannerman said that this is a possibility in the Penkovsky case,
and CIA is awaiting the assessment reports of other agencies in order to study
this possibility further.

Mr. Pace asked whether the USIB, in accepting other agencies' own
assessments of whether their information had been compromised, was not in
effect accepting self-serving statements rather than performing an abstract
assessment, Mr. Bannerman said that each agency is considered to have the
greatest competence in assessing the extent of any compromise of its own
information.

Mr. Gentile informed the Board that the Embassy in Moscow was first
designed and built as an apartment house. Then in 1952 it was made available
to the U. S. for lease and occupancy as an Embassy building and apartment
living quarters. The U. S. accepted the building, and in 1952 the Soviets
added three top floors for use as Embassy offices. During the construction
period no U. S. technical inspections were possible because access to the..
construction work was limited to cursory inspections. For a period of 3 weeks
in March 1953 no Americans were given access to the building, and the con-
struction area on the top three floors was covered by plywood screens said to
have been put up to hasten the drying of plaster. The U. S. occupied the
Embassy on May 1, 1953, under the lease. Since that time there have been 27
inspections in an effort to locate listening devices. Plaster was chipped in
spots, floors were taken up in some locations, and various searches made short
of tearing rooms apart all without locating any devices. Meanwhile, over
the years Embassy personnel have been briefed and cautioned on the assumption
that the Embassy was penetrated by listening devices.

On June 20, 1962, Mr. Gentile continued, his predecessors in the State
Department Office of Security received from CIA the Soviet defector's 1962
report that the Embassy was bugged. This was made known to the State Department
resident security technician who went to Moscow 3 months later. There is nothing
in the files to indicate if any instructions went out or any action taken on
the basis of the 1962 defector report. There is no indication that the
Ambassador was informed.

In February 1964 the State Department resident security technician in
the Moscow Embassy returned to Washington and there was discussed the question
of the possible total destruction of an Embassy room in an effort to find
listening devices. In March 1964 the State Department Security people received
the report given by the second Soviet defector, pinpointing locations of con-
cealed microphones. Accordingly, the destruction of one room was authorized
by the Department of State Security Office (Room 10008 on the top floor) and
on April 23, 1964, the first of the 41 microphones was uncovered.

Mr. Coyne asked about the cutting of the cables. Mr. Gentile said that
this occurred two days after the discovery of the first microphone on April 23.
The decision was made in the Security Office of State, by the chief technician
in Moscow. Mr. Clifford asked whether it had occurred to responsible officials
to consider the possibility of exploiting the microphones found. Mr. Gentile
said that in the first place it was assumed that the Soviets had spotted the
technical men who were sent in by State Department, and that the noise of the
Jackhammmer and other digging operations had alerted the Soviets that the dis-
coveries had been made. Moreover, the microphones discovered were not con-
sidered unique finds requiring any unique technical study. Moreover, as part
of standing operations procedure, State notified the CIA and other interested
agencies immediately on making the first find, although this notification was
not made at the Secretary level. It was decided that exploitation was not
feasible.

The decision to cut the cables, however, was made by State Department,
Mr. Gentile said. In answer to Mr. Murphy's question he said that State
Department desk officers and the Ambassadors were told, but their judgments
were not sought as to the matter of cutting the cables.
IDEALIST/CORONA/OXCART

TOP SECRET

Mr. Bannerman stated that the prescribed procedure was followed on
the question of possible exploitation. State Department people discussed this
with counterintelligence officers in CIA (including Mr. Angelton) and it was
decided that no exploitation was possible because the Soviets had undoubtedly
learned of the discovery of the microphones uncovered by extensive and noisy
digging operations.

Mr. Gentile said that much remains to be done, including (1) a complete
technical assessment of the fidelity of the Soviet devices (2) completion of
the examination of the North Wing of the Embassy, and (3) the initiation of a
search of the South Wing.

Mr. Bannerman observed that a key factor is the tremendous disadvantage
to the U. S. resulting from Soviet control of the construction of buildings to
be occupied by U. S. personnel.

As for the level of Soviet capability evidenced by the quality and kind
of microphones discovered, Dr. Tordella said that they are better than the ones
we have for this particular kind of installation.

Dr. Tordella expressed the opinion that the Moscow installation resulted
in a compromise of our encrypted communications, particularly if you accord to
the Soviets the capability of the U. S., U. K., and Germans. From 1953-1959
State used the MCR code machine (identical to that used by U. S. military attaches,
1953-1954) which is vulnerable to audiosurveillance which can detect the plain
text being printed by the machine. Also the MCB machine could be cryptographically
reconstructed by the opposition. (In 1948 an Army code room Sergeant defected
under circumstances indicating that he had photographed materials which would
have given complete information on the machine.) So, from 1953-1959 we must
assume the Soviets were capable of reconstructing the machine, and also of
reading the plain text from which the encryptions were made. All incoming and
outgoing encrypted traffic of the Embassy could have been read, as well as
traffic of other Iron Curtain U. S. posts using this system. From 1959-196.2
(before installation: the electronically shielded code room in the Embassy)
all Confidential encyphered material was subject to audio attack. Secret traffic
was vulnerable until 1961, as was Top Secret until 1960 when the use of l-time
pads was required. After December 1962 (when the electronically shielded room
was installed), according to tests run by NSA, there was no compromise of
Embassy traffic through audio or electromagnetic penetrations. The screen
grill antenna found in the wall of the North Wing of the Embassy, with coaxial
cables attached, probably served as a Soviet means of electronic intercept of
emanations from the U. S. l-time teleprinter in the Embassy (and although this
effort was frustrated in October 1960 when such machines were not permitted
to be used at U. S. posts behind the Iron Curtain, that rule was lifted with
respect to our Embassy in the USSR when the acoustically shielded room was
installed in Moscow.)

As for the microwave energy signal which has been beamed at the Embassy
building at least since 1957, Dr. Tordella believes that the purpose of the
signal is to harrassus.

Ar 12:05 p.m. Messrs. Tordella, Bannerman and Gentile departed the
Board mesing with the thanks of the Chairman for their assistance.

Following lunch, the Board resumed its meeting at 1:00 p.m. at which
time Mr. R. J. Smith of CIA (Deputy to Mr. Ray Cline, Deputy DCI for Intelligence)
presented a briefing of the situation in Laos, South Vietnam, North Vietnam,
Cambodia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. (Chairman Clifford left the meeting in
response to a telephone call from the President.)

Mr. Smith outlined some CIA views concerning intentions and capabilities
of the Chinese Communists: (1) the Chicoms hope to see China become a center
of Communist authority world-wide, setting policy even for the USSR (2) the
Chicom leaders presently wish to avoid high risk actions (3) Communist China
has not achieved a nuclear production capability (4) of the 15 SAM sites in
China, only 4 are operational, and the others lack equipment, and (5) the
Chicom Air Force is deteriorating and replacements are slow in coming.
believes that. Communist China will encourage Hanoi to keep high level of pressure
going in Laos and South Vietnam; will continue efforts to subvert Malaysia; will
avoid hostilities with the U. S.; will avoid a formal breach with the USSR, pre-
ferring to erode Soviet influence around the world; and will continue to support
militant elements of Communist Parties in Africa, Latin America and Southeast
Asia.

In answer to a question by Mr. Pace, Mr. Smith expressed the opinion
that if the U. S. moved against Hanoi in the Air, the Chicoms would not react.

Mr. Smith also mentioned briefly the situations in Cuba and in India.
Mr. Smith concluded his presentation and left the Board meeting at 2:05 p.m.

At 2:10 the Board meeting was joined by Colonel Steakley, Director of
the Joint Reconnaissance Center of the JCS. Colonel Steakley described in some
detail the various COMINT, ELINT, Telemetry, and photographic collection
programs which are carried out through peripheral and overflight aircraft missions
under the monitorship of the JRC (including surface ship and submarine collection
of COMINT and ELINT along the China coast). Colonel Steakley referred to the
ELINT collection (plus some COMINT and telemetry) through RA-3B peripheral
flights in the Artic; C-130 peripheral flights for COMINT collection in the
Pacific, European and Cuban areas, including KC-135 missions near the Soviet
border; photographic missions (BOW TIE) flown with RF-101 aircraft by Chinat
pilots over coastal areas of Southeast China; covert photo collection on MATS
(C-97 G) flights over Europe and Indonesia; C-135 telemetry collection missions
near the launch areas and impact areas involved in Soviet space and missile
activities; and collection of telemetry from satellites over Africa.

Colonel Steakley described the wain functions of the JRC as pertaining to
(1) monitoring of military reconnaissance programs (2) review and evaluation of
missions proposed by the military (3) coordination of reconnaissance operations
at the national level (4) U. S. and allied cooperation (5) monitoring of actual
reconnaissance operations (6) coordination of policies and procedures, and
(7) monitoring of special OPLANS.

In response to a query from Dr. Baker, Colonel Steakley acknoledged
that cur reconnaissance activity gives the Soviets \"training\" in detection and in
the development of countermeasures.

Mr. Coyne asked whether there is not considerable duplication of in-
telligence collection as a result of the multiplicity of reconnaissance missions
being flown in the same target areas. Colonel Steakley said that some
duplication results, but in any event a single ELINT mission will not always
pick up all the desired intelligence, whereas follow-on missions will pick up
emissions which might not have been encountered on the previous run.

A question was asked by Mr. Coyne about the JRC's working relationship
with the NRO. Colonel Steakley said that this is satisfactory, even though
not documented.

Dr. Baker asked whether the system is fast enough to accommodate urgent
intelligence requirements which might be formulated by non-military agencies,
calling for overflights of denied territory, for example. Colonel Steakley
said that this capability is adequate and he cited the example of the recent
Alaskan earthquake, photographs of which were delivered to Wachington within
15 hours after the request was made for them. In answer to a query by Dr. Baker
along this same line, Colonel Steakley said that the System is capable of
exercising straight-lime channel of command to meet intelligence requirement
which, e.g., the Secretary of Defense might suddenly need to have fulfilled
such as a carrier-based U-2 mission over a particular intelligence target all
of a sudden. Colonel Steakley expressed confidence that the JRC mechanism and
resources are such that suddenly-arising intelligence reconnaissance needs can
be met quickly.

Colonel Steakley's visit with the Board was completed and he departed
the meeting at 3:30 p.m.

In executive session (with Dr. Baker in the chair during Mr. Clifford's
absence) Board members considered and approved proposed letters from the
Chairman requesting that State, Defense, CIA and the DCI up-date and revise
the scope and coverage of their respective annual reports to the Board con-
cerning the conduct of their intelligence-related responsibilities.
letters were approved and subsequently dispatched by the Chairman.

These
At 3:55 p.m. Chairman Clifford returned from the President's office and
rejoined the Board meeting..

The Board meeting was joined at this point by the DCI, Mr. McCone; and
Messrs. Kirkpatrick, Fitzgerald, and Meyers of CIA. Chairman Clifford said that
the Board would appreciate hearing from the DCI concerning items of interest
to Board members as set out in the list previously provided to the DCI, as
well as any other matters which the DCI might wish to cover.

At the DCI's suggestion, Mr. Fitzgerald took up the subject of Cuba
which he had discussed previously at the meeting of the Board in April.
He reported the recent defection to the U. S. of a Cuban military officer who

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT: Covert Action Panel Meeting 6/5/64
(Discussion With Secretary, Special Group, et al.)

On 6/5/64, at the Board's offices, Mr. Murphy held a meeting of the
Board's Covert Action Panel (Messrs. Murphy, Gray and Langer) also attended
by General Doolittle; J. Patrick Coyne; and A. R. Ash.

At the invitation of Chairman Murphy the meeting was joined by Mr. Peter
Jessup who since January 20, 1964, has been serving as Secretary of the Special
NSC 5412/2 Group.

In answer to questions asked by Panel members, Mr. Jessup provided a
description of the Special Group and its activities, as follows:

The Special Group is chaired by Mr. McGeorge Bundy; Mr. Alexis Johnson
represents the State Department; Mr. Cyrus Vance represents the Secretary of
Defense; and Mr. McCone the CIA. These Group members are back-stopped by
small staffs in their respective agencies.

Meetings of the Special Group are held once each week. They are \"action\"
meetings not talk-fests, and the members have done their homework beforehand.
The Chairman of the JCS attends when the agenda includes subjects of particular
JCS interest (since January he has attended two meetings for discussion of Cuba
matters).

Most of the covert actions considered by the Special Group are CIA pro-
posals, although other members suggest actions (for example, State Department
brought up for discussion the matter of supplying arms in Tangayika). The State
Department is considered to serve as the \"conscience\" of the Special Group in its
consideration of proposed covert actions. During the current year some 23 of
39 proposals were favorably considered by the Group.

About 50 per cent of the covert actions coming before the Special Group
are carried out by the Joint Reconnaissance Center (JRC) of the JCS, in the
aerial reconnaissance field. Since January 1, the Group has approved actions
with respect to Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Panama, Chile, Congo, Angola,
Tibet, Zanzibar, and China, among others. For example, the April 29, 1964,
meeting included discussions of the Chilean elections; Cuba; a JRC forecast of
peripheral missions; and reconnaissance coverage from India of a Chinese Communist
test range.

(Minutes of Special Group meetings are provided only to the members.
(In answer to a specific question from Mr. Murphy, Mr. Jessup said that to
his knowledge there has been no systematic review by the Special Group con-
cerning the results of actions taken pursuant to previous Group approvals.)

(
The Group follows the policy of referring to the President those pro-
posed actions as to which Group members have differences of opinion regarding
the probability and acceptability of \"noise levels\" which would result from the
actions. Since January, the subject of Cuba has been taken up with the President
with a view to obtaining guidance on the level of covert action activity desired
during this election year.

Mr. Jessup concluded his visit with the Board Panel and departed the
meeting at this point.

Next, the Board Panel meeting was joined by Messrs. Dick Helms and
Cord Meyer of CIA.

Mr. Helms said that with regard to Cuba there has been an effective stand-
down in externally-mounted sabotage operations since February. Policy approvals
have been given only to oddments of \"passive sabotage\", such as supplying agents
with incendiary pencils, etc.; a mattress factory and a plastic works were burned
down; but CIA does not consider that such operations are enough and they are not
the whole program that CIA wants to conduct. The \"Track II\" paper in the State
Department calls for CIA support of Cuban exile group activity, but no CIA
direction and control; and few results are possible from such an approach, with
Artime burning down a sugar mill, but Manolo Ray getting arrested by the British.
There have been acts of sabotage performed on tractors carried by vessels en route
to Cuba. On the economic front, after Castro had put out false rumors of an
expected short sugar crop, in order to run up the world market price, the CIA
countered by assembling correct information which when published brought the
price down again.

With regard to Soviet personnel in Cuba, Mr. Helms estimated that there are
from 15,000 to 18,000 on the Island, although U. S. intelligence community
estimators place the figure at from 4,000 to 5,000.

Concerning Chile, Mr. Helms said that the coming Presidential elections
there on September 13 are viewed with serious concern. The Socialists there are
more radical than the Communists, and candidate Allende (backed by the FRAP
party) may have a strong chance of winning. Moreover, the constitutional-minded
Chileans would accept a regularly-elected Communist as President and would not take
coup action to put him out of office. Allende is being supported by the USSR at
the rate of about one-quarter million dollars a month, and his success at the polls
is important to the Soviets who can then point to the election as an example of a
\"peaceful\" Communist victory.

CIA support of Chilean Christian Democrat candidate Frei included $750,000
in March; and on May 14, another $1.25 million was added following the urgings of
major business elements in Chile and the U. S. Some support is also being given
to anti-Communist candidate Edwards; to Protestants; and to poll-taking groups.

TOP SECRET

Referring to Panama, Mr. Helms observed that CIA appeared for the moment to
have backed the right candidate -- Rables.

With reference to Brazil, Mr. Helms said that the coup was Brazil -
inspired and spontaneous, not a U. S. operation. He added that Brazil had
come close to being lost to the Communists through subversion from the top
(Goulart).

Turning to the subject of Southeast Asia, Mr. Helms said that there have
been many lengthy discussions about South Vietnam and about getting the Viet
Cong out of that country. This objective has been talked to death, and all
possibilities considered; but no one seems to be preoccupied with finding a way
to replace the political fabric that was lost in South Vietnam when the Diem regime
was overthrown. The present government is all a military show. Mr. Helms added
that the Bhuddists are a political group but not cohesive. As for prospects of
effecting intelligence infiltration of North Vietnam, Mr. Helms said that CIA
had been trying, but the target country is small and there is not much intelli-
gence to obtain there. At present MACV is in charge of sabotage efforts against
North Vietnam. In Mr. Helms' opinion there is a clear need to create a new
political structure in South Vietnam or else there will be little use in
\"striking against the North\".

In Laos, Mr. Helms said, the Pathet Lao can take over at will. He noted
that the Meo's are still intact (only one battalion) and are being supplied
by CIA air drops (from Thailand) of weapons, food and medicines.

Mr. Cord Meyer referred to the crisis of the Adoula government in the
Congo. There are 200 men in Brazzaville, with Chicom support, ready to
assassinate cabinet officers. When the UN forces leave on June 30 the 30,000-man
Congolese National Army will have a big job to do. Mobutu and officers of the
Army are wary of providing much training down to the platoon level, because they
distrust these troops in arms. Meanwhile, CIA has supplied the Army with 6
airplanes and pilots, and authority has now been received by CIA to double this
support.

Regarding Cyprus, Mr. Helms said that the Turks are threatening to go
onto the island with troops within 24 hours.

Messrs. Helms and Meyer left the Panel meeting at this point.

The Board Panel meeting was next joined by Mr. Alexis Johnson of the
State Department. He filled the Panel members in on the latest Cyprus development
including the President's message to the head of the Turkish government; and
General Lemnitzer's trip to Turkey to point out the hazard to Turkey's NATO
relationships if Turkey moved into Cyprus with troops.

Panel Chairman Murphy asked Mr. Johnson for any comments he might have
regarding State Department relationships with the Special Group, and with
the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

SECACT
Mr. Johnson said that as State Department representative on the
Special Group he tries to do the difficult job of viewing the risks against
the gains involved in proposed covert actions. Issues rarely arise in the
Special Group because problems are first staffed in the member agencies.
In State Mr. Johnson is staffed by Mr. Scott of INR who maintains contacts
with FBI and CIA - the relation with FBI having been recently regularized
as had been done earlier in the case of CIA. Mr. Scott consults Mr. Johnson
on all covert operations and any issues, and also focuses on NRO matters
for Mr. Johnson. In all, Mr. Johnson feels that the Special Group system is satis-
factory. He acknowledged, however, that the Special Group does not have a pro-
cedure for systematic look-back at the results of programs previously approved.
From State's point of view, he could see the need for such a procedure, for he
never hears about projects once they are approved -- unless something goes
wrong. Mr. Johnson said that within State a quarterly review is made of
political action programs, and he sees a need for monitoring of programs in
the Special Group.

As for State's relations with the President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board, Mr. Johnson recalled that one problem arose with the Board's
November 22 report on the Dunlap case, which caused him considerable concern
particularly the discussion language supporting the Board's recommendations on
subjects involving State, CIA and FBI. Mr. Johnson thought that he should
have been given an opportunity to comment to the Board concerning the FBI and
CIA complaints which were reflected in the recommendations.

Mr. Coyne then gave Mr. Johnson some of the background of one of the
Board's recommendations which involved State-CIA-FBI and which pertained to a
development of such sensitivity as to closely restrict the Board's disclosure
of it. (Mr. Coyne took the initiative, after the Panel meeting, to suggest to
FBI that Mr. Johnson be briefed on this sensitive item, in order that State
Department might be in a position to assist, and not unwittingly hinder,
related operations of FBI and CIA interest abroad. FBI did this soon afterward, and
Mr. Johnson expressed to Mr. Coyne his satisfaction at this handling of the
matter.)

Mr. Murphy next brought up the subject of the recently discovered audio
penetration of the U. S. Embassy, Moscow. Mr. Murphy noted that the preliminary
USIB damage assessment contained State Department comments to the effect that
the compromise was not too serious, and he wondered if this accurately re-
flected the State Department view of the matter. Mr. Johnson said that during
the audio penetration period the State Department sent many messages to our
Ambassador in Moscow, telling him to make certain representations to the Soviets;
and in turn the Ambassador sent messages to Washington reporting on what he had
said to the Soviets and what they said to him; so, Mr. Johnson felt that no
damaging breach had occurred in this regard -- except for perhaps any Department
or Embassy analyses that might have appeared in messages intercepted by the
Soviets. Mr. Johnson added that our people at posts behind the Iron Curtain
assume that they are \"bugged\" and they behave accordingly; and Mr. Johnson
related to the Panel his own experience while serving at Prague where \"he
dug out 35 mikes\".

TOP SECRET

Mr. Murphy raised with Mr. Johnson the question as to whether subordinates
should be allowed to make decisions such as the cutting of the co-axial cables
discovered leading out of the Embassy in Moscow -- Mr. Murphy pointing out that
such action appeared premature and prevented the technicians from making technical
examinations of value and importance. Mr. Murphy also noted that subordinates
in State and CIA had assumed responsibility for the decision that no attempt
would be made to exploit the devices found in Moscow. Mr. Johnson was unaware
of policy direction regarding such matters, and Mr. Coyne made known to him
the provisions of NSC 5618 covering the subject.

With reference to North Vietnam, Mr. Johnson noted that the situation
is most discouraging insofar as covert infiltration actions are concerned.
He said that CIA had tried hard, and the activity has now been transferred to
MACV in Saigon.

Mr. Johnson concluded his visit with the Board Panel and departed the
meeting.

In executive session, Panel Chairman Murphy asked that the Board Staff's
review of the Special Group minutes include summaries of items pertaining to
Vietnam and Cuba, for later study by the Panel.

The Panel Meeting adjourned at 12:15 p.m.

THE WHITE HOUSE
MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE
WASHINGTON
TOP SECRET
January 11, 1963

SUBJECT: CUBA (Review on 1/10/63 of Records of the
Special NSC 5412/2 Group)

On 1-10-63 the writer reviewed in the offices of Mr. Tom
Parrott, Executive Secretary, Special NSC 5412/2 Group, the
records of the Special Group which Mr. Parrott identified as
relating to considerations given by the Special Group to recon-
naissance and covert action operations with regard to Cuba.
(Attached hereto is a copy, supplied by Mr. Parrott from his
records, of a \"Memorandum for the Record\" dated 10/21/62 on
the subject \"Reconnaissance of Cuba\" which Mr. Parrott had
prepared for another purpose.)

There follows a detailed summary of the results of a
review made by the writer of the Cuba items referred to in
Mr. Parrott's summary memorandum, and of other items which
the writer reviewed in the Special Group records pertaining
to Cuba.

Minutes of Meetings of the Special Group
(Augmented) - \"MONGOOSE\"

Minutes of the July 12, 1962 Meeting
of the Special Group (Augmented)

Those present were the Attorney General, Mr. Johnson,
Mr. Gilpatric, Mr. McCone, General Carter, General Lemnitzer,
General Lansdale, and Dr. Cline (for part of the meeting).

The Group noted a paper presented by the State Department
member concerning \"Guideline for a post-Castro Political
Program.\"

General Lansdale briefed the Group on the number of agents
now in Cuba, including legal residents, plus infiltrated teams.
It was decided that a CIA proposal, for resupply of agent teams
and possibly of resistance groups, should be deferred pending
a broader review of the entire situation. General Taylor
specified, however, that if an urgent need arose for air supply
at any time, the proposal could be made to the Special Group
(Augmented).

Mr. McCone and General Lansdale stated that a sizable
number of intelligence reports were coming out of Cuba,
largely on political and economic matters. Mr. McCone emphasized
TOP SECRET

Control System

Docld:34671890 Page 4

TOP SECRET

that no high-level penetration of the Cuban Government had been
achieved. In answer to a question from the Attorney General,
General Lansdale said that intelligence indicated that although
there was widespread dissatisfaction with Castro, there was
no rallying point for active opposition.

The Attorney General and Mr. Johnson emphasized the need
for an effort to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activi-
ties by the Castro regime in the Hemisphere, Mr. McCone noting
that such efforts to date had been fruitless.

Dr. Cline showed the Group the extent of reconnaissance
coverage of Cuba. Mr. McCone emphasized that this program has
developed 'complete information on deployments and facilities
for the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and he particularly noted
that these missions have verified that there is sufficient
logistic support for a 75,000-man military force. \"No missile
sites have been found.\"

The Group agreed on a complete review of MONGOOSE toward
the end of July, with participation by the Secretaries of State
and Defense. General Taylor emphasized that in the preparation
for such review, there would be a need for summaries of results
obtained to date, of intelligence developed, and of future
alternatives opened to the United States (including possible
activities in other parts of Latin America).

Mr. Johnson said that the State Department is investigating
the possibilities for subsidizing Japanese purchases of Dominican
sugar to divert purchases from Cuba and thereby deprive Cuba
of a source of dollars, and Mr. Johnson asked that MONGOOSE
operational representatives look into this further. Mr. McCone
said that the CIA could use unvouchered funds for this purpose,
but it would be illegal to use covert funds as a means of
evading the intent of Congress.

Minutes of the October 4, 1962 Meeting
of the Special Group (Augmented)

Those present for this meeting with regard to Operation
MONGOOSE were the Attorney General, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric,
General Lansdale, Mr. McCone, General Carter, and Mr. Wilson.

The Attorney General informed the Group that higher authority
was concerned about progress on the MONGOOSE program and felt
that more priority should be given to trying to mount sabotage
operations. The Attorney General wondered if a new look were

TOP SECRET

not required in view of the meager results obtained, especially
in the sabotage field, and he urged \"massive activity\" within
the entire MONGOOSE framework.

General Lansdale thought that another attempt should be
made against the major target which had been the subject of
three unsuccessful missions and he said that six new missions/
were in the planning stage.

Mr. Johnson said that the \"massive activity\" would have
to come from within, and he hoped to be able to present soon
to the Group a plan for giving Cuban exiles more of a free hand,
fully realizing that this will give additional visibility to
their activities. Mr. McCone reserved judgment on the feasi-
bility and desirability of such a program, and Mr. Johnson
agreed that he had reservations as well.

Mr. McCone said that he had received the impression
that although high levels of our Government wanted increased
activity, they still want to keep it at a low noise level,
but Mr. McCone did not believe this would be possible and he
felt that any sabotage would be blamed on the United States.
Mr. McCone cited the enormous number of telephone calls
directed at CIA at the time the skin divers landed in east
Cuba, and the time that the Cuban exile students shot up the
apartment house. Mr. McCone therefore urged that responsible
officials be prepared to accept a higher noise level if they
want to get on with operations.
-
The Attorney General, in partial rebuttal, said that the
reasons people had such concern were (a) the fact that the skin
divers were Americans, and (b) the fact that the student activity
was irresponsible and foolish and if either of these had
in fact been engineered by the United States it would have
been a great mistake. The Attorney General also related the
possibility of attributability to the importance of the
particular undertaking, and he questioned whether we are going
down the right road or whether more \"direct action\" were not
indicated. He urged that alternative and imaginative plans
be developed.

Mr. McCone said that internal restrictions are so rigid
that internal uprisings would surely be brutally suppressed.
(It was agreed that the current guidelines did not call for
inciting such an uprising.)

Mr. McCone and General Carter explained the tremendous
efforts necessary to insure that operations such as the sabotage
operation previously authorized cannot be pinned directly on
the United States. (After discussion, the Group agreed that
it was not necessary to go to such extreme lengths to insure

nonattribution, and that short cuts were desirable.)
TOP SECRET
Mr. Gilpatric informed the Group that the Defense Depart-
ment was hard at work on establishing a Cuban brigade. Recruits.
would be trained from four to five months and then placed on
call for any future action.

General Taylor reported that the Joint Staff is refining
various contingency military plans based on a variety of
possible situations, including Soviet 'action against Berlin;
'the presence of bloc offensive weapons in Cuba\"; an attack
against Guantanamo; a popular uprising; armed Cuban subversion
in the Hemisphere; and \"the establishment of a direct threat
to the United States.\"

Dr. Scoville and Colonel Steakley were present at this
Group meeting for an item regarding reconnaissance of Cuba.
It was pointed out that the CIA is \"restricted to using its
high-performance vehicle in the southeast quadrant of Cuba,
because of SAM sites.\" It was questioned whether this was a
reasonable restriction at that time, particularly when SAMS
were almost certainly not operational.
*
Colonel Steakley and Dr. Scoville described a spectrum
of reconnaissance activities which could be undertaken,
ranging from low-level, Navy fighters through drones, up to
the Agency's capabilities, particularly equipped with new radar
countermeasures. As a result of the discussion there was agree-
ment that the Department of Defense and the CIA should get
together on recommendations for targets within Cuba that require
coverage, and on recommendations as to how to achieve this
coverage. A meeting was set for the following Tuesday when
Defense and CIA were to be prepared to discuss all possibilities,
including requirements, capabilities, vulnerabilities, etc.

There was some discussion of the desirability of mining
Cuban waters, using nonattributable mines appearing to be home-
made and laid by small aircraft operated by Cubans.

It was agreed that the Attorney General would act as
Chairman of the Special Group (Augmented) for the time being.

It was agreed that four major points which had emerged
from this meeting were: (1) we ought to go all-out for increased
intelligence; (2) there should be considerably more sabotage;
(3) restrictions on attributability can be relaxed so that
training and preparations can be subject to short cuts; and
(4) all efforts should be made to develop new and imaginative
approaches to the possibility of getting rid of the Castro regime.

Minutes of the October 9, 1962 Meeting
of the Special Group (Augmented)

Present for this meeting were the Attorney General,
Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, General Taylor, Mr. Mc-
Cone, Mr. Wilson, Dr. Charyk, Dr. Scoville, Colonel Steakley,
and Colonel Ledford, CIA.

The Group discussed various possibilities of accomplish-
ing reconnaissance of Cuba, ranging from low-level coverage
by tactical aircraft to high-performance aircraft and drones.
Overflights and peripheral flights were discussed. It was
agreed that the first priority is one high-performance mission
in the western part of the island, to be accomplished by all-
out ELINT support, and depending on the results of this, a
number of similar sorties might be mounted. (The first mission
was later approved by higher authority, with the decision on
the second proposition left open. The entire package was to
be discussed at the USIB and by the Chiefs on Wednesday,
October 10.)

Along with the minutes of this October 9 Meeting there
was in file a memorandum from Mr. Parrott to Mr. Bundy, dated
October 11, 1962. It was reflected in Mr. Parrott's memorandum
that Mr. Gilpatric had called at 2:15 P.M. to say he and Mr.
McCone had finally agreed that the one high-performance flight
would be flown as a military flight with a SAC pilot. CIA had
wanted to stick to the existing system for the first flight,
simply to avoid any delay. The SAC pilot would require some
additional training because the equipment in the improved
vehicle was new to him, but Mr. Gilpatric and Mr. McCone
apparently felt that this was an acceptable delay and it was
hoped to get the flight off over the weekend. It was further
stated in Mr. Parrott's memorandum that it seemed agreed that
within the terms of the authorization given by higher authority
it would be necessary to go back for approval of the next
phase contemplating two or three more high-performance missions,
and Mr. Gilpatric seemed to feel that the discussion which had
taken place with higher authority was explicit enough to get
an emergency authority by telephone. Mr. Parrott further in-
formed Mr. Bundy that the Cover Committee (Messrs. Charyk,
Hilsman, Scoville, Parrott, \"et al\") had met that morning and
had agreed on a new cover story for a military pilot and a
revised cover story for civilian pilots, and with the necessary
changes it was thought that the cover story would be ready
that afternoon. Mr. Parrott pointed out to Mr. Bundy that,on
the military side, the flight is characterized as military
reconnaissance of the periphery of the target area, with parti-
cular reference to the Secretary of State's recent comments to
the OAS Ministers to the effect that we are increasing surveil-
lance activities. (A penciled note on the file copy of this

memorandum read: \"Later was delayed due to disagreement on
account of training required.\"

There was also an October 12, 1962 addendum to the above-
mentioned October 1l memorandum from Mr. Parrott to Mr. Bundy,
stating: \"Later.\" The memorandum related that, according to
Mr. Knocke, Mr. McCone had decided the day before (October 11)
that these flights must be either entirely overt or entirely
covert, and he didn't particularly care which so long as they
were accomplished as soon as possible. In Mr. McCone's absence,
General Carter had come to an agreement with General McKee,
Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, along those lines on
October 11; later, however, Mr. Gilpatric said that this was
not his understanding of the terms of authorization from higher
authority. Mr. Gilpatric felt that the idea was that a uniformed
pilot should operate the Agency's vehicle.

On October 12 at 12:45, General Carter had a meeting with
Mr. Bundy and at that time General Carter stated that the Agency
operation was ready to go except for weather, and that this
would hold it up until at least Sunday, and meantime the SAC
pilot would have received the necessary training. It was agreed
that if the pilot was sufficiently trained by the earliest time
the mission could be mounted, the flight would go, with all
other arrangements within the Agency framework. If the pilot
were not ready by the time the vehicle was ready, the mission
would be mounted as a completely Agency operation, i.e., with
a civilian pilot. According to Mr. Lay, the USIB had taken
the following actions at its October 10, 1962 meeting with
respect to the targets listed in the COMOR paper of October 6:
(1) The Group I targets were not discussed by USIB, the impli-
cation being that there was no problem from the point of view
of USIB's jurisdiction. (2) Groups II and III should be
covered as rapidly as possible initially, and after that the
frequency of coverage would be further examined. (3) COMOR
was to re-do the section of the October 6 paper dealing with
Group IV, with targets to be broken out in categories of priorty,
and USIB would consider this new paper on October 17. US IB
did not consider any operational aspects, but confined them-
selves to the importance of the targets and the frequency
of coverage.

Minutes of February 1, 1962 Meeting of the Special Group

This meeting was attended by General Taylor, Mr. Johnson,
Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. Helms.

On the subject of Cuba, the Chairman read his memorandum
to higher authority dated January 26, summarizing progress up
to that time. The memorandum from General Lansdale suggesting
a different approach to the content of the minutes of the
meeting of the preceding week on Cuba was discussed, and it
was agreed that the minutes would stand as prepared. General
Lansdale's report of February 1 on popular support for the
OAS meeting was distributed. Mr. Parrott's summary states
that the Cuba missions were stepped up from one per month
to two per month.

Minutes of June 14, 1962 Meeting of the Special Group

This meeting was attended by General Taylor, Mr. Johnson,
Mr. Gilpatric, and General Carter.

On the subject of \"Request for Special Cuban Missions,
it was stated that the COMOR proposal dated June 13, 1962 was
approved. (A handwritten notation on the file copy of these
minutes stated that \"Higher authority informed June 15 about
possibility of uprising,\" and there was also a notation that
the June 13 memorandum regarding the COMOR request had been
\"rewritten for book.\")

Minutes of the July 12, 1962 Meeting of the Special Group

The Group agreed to recommend approval of various requests
for authorizations. In the case of Cuba, the minutes reflect
agreement to continue with the presently authorized schedule
of two flights per month. General Taylor asked that for the
purpose of discussing this matter with higher authority, CIA
should prepare a paper on Cuba, setting forth a summary of
information which had been obtained to date, the number of
missions mounted, what is proposed to be looked at in the
future, and the frequency of further coverage desired.

Memorandum for the President from the Special Group,
July 20, 1962

The Special Group records contain a memorandum for the
President from General Taylor dated July 20, 1962, bearing a
handwritten notation by General Taylor, \"Approved by H. A.

the memorandum to the President was as follows:

In the Special Group we are aware that we have been
proceeding on a day-by-day basis in requesting authority
for overflight reconnaissance. At our meeting yesterday,
we took a long look ahead at the estimated requirements
for the next few months and agreed that the following

recommended for that month.

Minutes of August 9, 1962 Meeting of the Special Group

Those present were General Taylor, Mr. McCone, Mr. Hilsman,
and Mr. William Bundy.

On the subject of \"Cuba Reconnaissance\" it was stated
that the Group agreed that the second mission authorized for
August should be flown whenever the DCI decides that the im-
mediate situation with respect to Soviet materiel justifies
it. It was noted that this would use up existing authority
for August, and if a third mission should become necessary
later in the month, it should be considered on its merits at
that time.

Minutes of August 30, 1962 Meeting of the Special Group

Those present were General Taylor, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gil-
patric, General Lemnitzer and Mr. Bundy.

The minutes reflect that in connection with the Agency's
monthly forecast, General Carter mentioned that there might be
an additional requirement for flights over Cuba. (In the
\"Memorandum for the Record,\" October 21, 1962, on the subject
\"Reconnaissance of Cuba,\" attached hereto, there appears beside
the item dealing with this meeting the penciled notation
\"primarily low-level.\")

Minutes of September 10, 1962 Meeting of the Special Group

Those present at this meeting, which took place in Mr.

the Acting Director of Central Intelligence, \"and others.\"

coverage of the Isle of Pines and the eastern portion of Cuba
at this time. He felt, however, that it was unwise to combine.
extensive overflying of international waters with actual over-
flights. He pointed out that the long peripheral flights
would draw undue attention to the mission and, further, should
the aircraft fall into enemy hands after an overflight had
occurred, this would put the United States in a very poor position
for standing on its rights to overfly international waters.

Taking these views into account, the Agency's plans to
break this proposed coverage into four parts: the Isle of Pines;
the area roughly east of longitude 77 west; and two legs along
the coast, one north and one south.

Within this framework, higher authority gave approval this
morning for two additional missions to be added to the one for
which authority is currently outstanding. Priority will be
given to the two overflights. (A notation on the file copy
of these Special Group minutes states that as of this morning
it appears that weather will not permit a flight until at least
Friday, and longer range weather prospects are not very good,
consequently it will be some little time before these three
authorizations are used up.)

Minutes of September 14, 1962 Meeting of the Special Group

Those present were Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nitze,
General Lemnitzer, and General Carter.

The minutes of this meeting reflect that a JCS representa-
tive (Colonel Steakley) outlined the capabilities for low-level
coverage of certain targets in Cuba. It was noted that the
Secretary of Defense did not wish this operation considered
further until the results of Agency rèconnaissance in the same
area became available. General Carter said that special
efforts will be required to identify certain installations,
the nature of which is not clear at present. Colonel Steakley
distributed charts for the monthly book, on supplementing
ELINT coverage of Cuba which was begun today. The Group
had no objection to these missions. It was agreed that the
Joint Reconnaissance Center should keep an eye on all military
reconnaissance or surveillance flights in the Cuban area.
(The Special Group record of these minutes is contained in
a memorandum dated November 30, 1962, from Mr. Tom Parrott
to Deputy Secretary of Defense Gilpatric.)

Minutes of September 27, 1962 Meeting of the Special Group

Those present were General Taylor, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric,
General Lemnitzer, and General Carter.

CIA's October forecast of reconnaissance activities was
noted. The special mission request for Cuba was approved.
This brings the number of authorizations for this area back to
four, i.e., four had been previously authorized and one has
been successfully completed, leaving authority for three out-
standing.

Minutes of October 15, 1962 Meeting of the Special Group

A memorandum prepared for the Special Group records by
Mr. Parrott reflected that at a special meeting on this date
two U-2 missions, designed to cover all of Cuba, were approved,
and that these were concurred in by higher authority. It is
reflected that after the 15th of October additional coverage
was agreed on at other meetings, but the Special Group was not
convened for this purpose.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE
SUBJECT: Board Panel on Covert Action Operations

The Board Panel met in the Board's offices on September 6,
1963. Panel members present were Mr. Robert Murphy, Chairman;
Mr. Gordon Gray; and Dr. William Langer. Messrs. Coyne and
Ash also attended the meeting.

During the course of its meeting the Panel was briefed
by Mr. Richard Helms (Deputy DCI/Plans, CIA) and his assistants,
Mr. Cord Meyer and Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald (head of CIA's head-
quarters staff dealing with Cuba). Highlights of the briefings
were as follows:

MESSRS. HELMS and MEYER
British Guiana

For a 79-day period ending in July, the anti-Jagan Trades
Union Congress maintained a general strike which was directed
against the Jagan regime, and had wide support among agrarian
and industrial workers in protest against an oppressive Labor
Bill proposed by Communist-oriented Jagan. CIA worked out
with George Meany a program of CIA financial support ($435,000)
to the strike under the cover of \"AFL-CIO contributions.\"
A CIA cover representative ran the strike program. The activity
was tricky because the United States and the British desired
to avoid violence; and the situation was complicated by the
fact that the British Governor-General opposed the strike.
CIA assesses the operation as a success because even though
Jagan was not unseated, the oppressive Labor Bill was withdrawn
and the TUC survived.

The strike activity took place against a background of
agreement between President Kennedy and MacMillan that the
British will not pull out of Guiana for an indefinite future
period, in the hope that a Communist government will not fill
the vacuum when the British do withdraw.

Cuban influence in the strike was in the form of a
$1 million advance from Cuba to the Guiana Import-Export
Corporation (an arm of Jagan's East Indian Peoples Progressive
Party) which in turn was borrowed by the Jagan regime.
Soviet help was indicated by a rumored transfer of over
$100,000 to Jagan's Party through banks.

TOP SECRET

CIA at present is providing $5,000 to the PNC Party made
up of anti-Jagan Africans in Guiana, and CIA is sending a Negro
cover representative from New York to aid the African Party.

(CIA considers that Mrs. Jagan, a known Communist from
Chicago, is the brains and guts of the Jagan operation.)
Haiti

CIA has surveyed the intentions and capabilities of
various Haitian exile groups and has supplied them with token
amounts of money to test them out. Efforts of the groups to
form a united front have failed, and in the Dominican Republic
Juan Bosch has reversed his intention to help unseat Devalier
for the present. Ten days ago CIA dropped 100 rifles and
ammunition to one Haitian exile group which has been given
sanctuary by a Dominican Republic commander stationed on the
border.
Dominican Republic

In this country there is a lack of democratic institutions,
political party structure, labor unions, or cooperatives of an
effective nature. Juan Bosch spends more time debating charges
by political opponents than in performing the administrative
job of running the country.

Bosch is an extreme conservative, economically, and refuses
to spend moneys in excess of assured revenues. A twenty per cent
unemployment figure is a major problem. Bosch has strengthened
his Cabinet at the urging of the U. S. Ambassador, and has made
peace with church elements (with CIA's help).

Opposition to Bosch is from the right and from parts of
the Army. He has met individual Communist moves as they arise
(e.g., an attempted infiltration of the Planning Commission),
but he is not pursuing an over-all anti-Communist program or
crusade. Although Bosch is considered by CIA to be anti-Castro
and anti-Soviet, he has not clamped down on returning trainees
from Cuba.

The twenty per cent unemployment situation provides the
basis for a coup in the months ahead. Meanwhile the Army
strong-man Embert (one of Trujillo's assassins) waits in the
wings.
Vietnam

CIA's role in Vietnam during the past two years has been.

(1) Total support of the war against the Viet Cong, in-
cluding the training of some 43,000 irregulars (now turned over
to U. S. Special Forces); support to the mountain people in
operations against the Viet Cong; and CIA training of U. S.
Special Forces in South Vietnam.

(2) CIA support of infiltration operations in North
Vietnam. (Not a great success. High losses of teams.)

a

In response to/question based on recent U. S. press allega-
tions that CIA is attempting to overthrow the Diem government:
\"CIA has never engaged in any such operations whatsoever
no instigation of the Buddhists -- nothing.\" CIA considers
that anti-CIA expressions of this kind originate with Madame
Nhu. The Viet Cong has been working on the Buddhists, but the
Buddhist leader who took sanctuary in the U. S. Embassy has
indicated that the Buddhist activity is motivated by a desire
to unify what is a loosely-joined, individual-Pagoda-type religious
movement.

August 20 saw the temple raids, martial law, and then the
arrests of students. One U. S. reaction was an August 24 cable-
gram from the State Department (presumably hastily prepared)
which, in nice diplomatic language to State Department representa-
tives in Saigon, gave the word to \"unload the Nhus\"
--
i.e.,
indicate to the anti-Diem plotters among the Generals that
they should get moving. However, the Generals proved to be lack-
ing in any intention to pursue their previously-professed anti-Diem
sentiments. CIA considers that the August 24 State Department
cablegram was the result of a miscalculation of the General's
true capabilities and intentions. CIA understands that subsequently
the Executive Committee of the NSC has met frequently on the sub-
ject, and more recent State Department cables have reflected
a revision of the earlier \"unload the Nhus\" message.

As yet the political situation in South Vietnam has not
had an adverse effect on the military effort, nor any increased
Viet Cong moves to capitalize on the situation. (Mr. Helms
departed at this point.)
Italy

With approval by the Special NSC 5412/2 Group, the Christian
Democratic Party was supported by CIA to the tune of $1 million
in the campaign leading to the June elections (plus $600,000
to other political elements in Italy). CIA's rationale for the
loss of CDP strength in the elections is that (1) there was a
loss of votes among the workers from the south who were given
the Communist treatment when they moved to the northern cities;

NW 185

(2) Fanfani, and (3) the Papal audience given to Khrushchev's
son-in-law had an effect on anti-Communist religious Italians,
including wives of the workers who had previously been able to
persuade their husbands to vote against the Communist candidates.
Meanwhile the Special Group has authorized CIA to spend $125,000
to support the CDP in current developments looking toward the
establishment of a center-left government coalition.
Bolivia

The Special Group has authorized a unique effort by CIA
in support of Paz Estancero's program to \"rationalize\" the
tin mines -- i.e., a project calling for the firing of surplus
tin miners and resettling them in new jobs. This will take
some time, but may result in breaking the leftist influence among
the Bolivian miners.
Brazil

Goulart is engaged in coordinated efforts to (1) discredit
the legislature, (2) obtain backing of the Army, and (3) make
a demagogic appeal to the Brazilizn people as the only leader
who can serve their interests.

CIA is carrying out covert action in the labor movement
and CIA believes that Communist control can be weakened.
In student groups, a number of CIA operations are going and
assets are in place (e.g., in the top executive committee of
the Students' Federation). However, there is no large-scale
CIA political operation in Brazil now.

MR. FITZGERALD
(On the subject of Cuba)

In June the NSC Special Group approved a CIA proposal for
a package of covert actions against Cuba. The covert program
assumes that means short of military action are to be attempted
on the premise that at the present rate of progress, the Castro
regime will be even more firmly entrenched because the passage
of time runs in Castro's favor.

Mr. Fitzgerald turned to a listing of the approved CIA
covert actions, remarking that if they seemed familiar proposals
which were previously under consideration, it should be kept in
mind that they have now been approved as \"interdependent\" actions.
The actions call for (1) covert collection of intelligence,
(2) propaganda action to stimulate \"low-key sabotage\", (3) stimulate
disaffection among the Cuban military, (4) an economic denial

TOP SECRET
program aimed at precluding acquisition of spare parts for
industrial machinery, and other products needed by Cuba,
(5) a sabotage program of a general nature, and (6) support
of anti-Castro autonomous groups, by giving them money and
the means to act, but under an arrangement which insures against
attribution to the United States, and which precludes operations
from U. S. or British soil. (The CIA philosophy is to back only
the potentially powerful and effective anti-Castro groups, and
the military is felt to be the best bet.)

The CIA effort represents a shift from external raids to
internal sabotage actions. CIA mounts about 10 \"black\"
operations a month, and Castro security forces have taken their
toll among the CIA teams. Three operations were conducted on
August 17 and 18, and among other things the objective is to
give encouragement to dissident Cuban elements such as military
officers who see no professional future under Castro who is
unloading military elements which aided him in his initial
seizure of the government. (The Special Group, Mr. Bundy and
other White House staff note the successful mounting of CIA'S
sabotage operations and have asked for more to be conducted.
CIA has found it necessary to resist any such pressures for
these operations to be increased beyond the present effective
capacity which CIA has at this time.)

Again, referring to the Cuban economy, it is hurting badly.
The United States has a monopoly on the spare parts for industrial
machinery needed by Cuba, and the USSR cannot supply them.
The Cuban electrical industry is particularly hard hit in this
respect. Castro's re-emphasis on an agricultural step-up means
increased efforts to produce sugar, a crop which presents a good
sabotage target. Finally, the Soviet aid at a rate of $1 million
a day (military and economic) is not enough to keep the Cuban
economy going. Cubans are not starving but they do not eat
\"comfortably\" even in the larger cities. CIA finds that a major
problem for their \"black\" teams is food re-supply in areas where
the Cubans are hard put to feed themselves.

CIA assets being used against Cuba:

Staff: 384 (Washington and Miami)
U. S. contractor personnel: 83
Foreign nationals: 525 (mostly Cubans)
Personnel at overseas posts: 45
DD/I staff: 12

CIA considers that of all nationalities, the Cubans are
the most unreliable (prone to exaggerate). The best informa-
tion comes from non-Cuban agents.

There are 108 agents in Cuba, including friendly diplomatic
personnel. There are two illegal teams working, one of which
has 200 sub-agents. There are 44 legal travelers working;
60 agents in Cuban shipping; and there are 31 penetrations of
Cuban installations abroad.

As to Soviet shipping into Cuba, CIA has an agent in
every port, but observers cannot say what is in the crates
they see being off-loaded.

Since January CIA has disseminated 150 photographs taken
by agents on-the-ground in Cuba. Also CIA has furnished its
agents in Cuba more and better radio equipment.

CIA's estimate of bloc personnel in Cuba: 12,000 Soviet
troops; 150 Chinese (mostly diplomatic personnel); an unknown
number of Soviet civilian technicians; and \"a lot\" of Czech and
other bloc technicians working with the Cuban military forces.

CIA considers that in the past 9 months progress has
been made in (1) intelligence collection with respect to Cuba,
and (2) effectiveness of the economic denial program. CIA
feels that the \"X\" factor is the volatility of the Cuban people
whose resignation to their lot under Castro would change over-
night if they see evidence of successful sabotage operations
against the Cuban government.

CIA penetration of the Cuban military got under way in
April. An agent brought out a Cuban Army major and he is being
sent back into Cuba next week. The major says that there is
a medium level acceptance among the military of the idea of
overthrowing Castro, but although this view is held by
individual members of the military they are fearful of communicating
it to others within Cuba. The wife of the chief of training of
the Cuban Army is a CIA source. Defectors are naming military
personnel to be contacted. There is, however, a fear of the
Castro security system.

The subject of specific kinds and amounts of Soviet military
equipment in Cuba is an area of the worst exaggeration and reporting
by nonprofessional observers. However, there is no evidence of
offensive missiles. There are 47 MIG-21's operated by Cuban pilots.
Cubans are at the SA-2 sites and are being trained to operate them.
We don't know what is in the caves, exactly. Neither CIA agents
nor Cubans (nor even Castro) has access to the Soviet armored camps.

CIA BRIEFING OF THE BOARD'S COVERT ACTION PANEL

APRIL 15, 1963

On April 15, 1963 Mr. Cord Meyer of CIA met at the Board's
offices with the Board's Panel on Covert Actions (Messers. Murphy,
and Gray); Mr. J. Patrick Coyne; and Mr. A. Russell Ash.

Mr. Meyer briefed the Board Panel on the major covert action
programs of the CIA (with the exception of programs relating to
Cuba, a subject scheduled to be covered in a briefing of the full
Board on April 23, 1963). Mr. Meyer described the political action
programs which had been pursued with respect to Chile. In his
briefing Mr. Meyer also covered programs with respect to Argentina,
Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, Japan,
Congo, Kenya, Italy and France.

(As a follow-up to the above mentioned briefing of the Board
Panel on Covert Actions, Mr. Gray and Mr. Coyne were given a further
briefing on the subject at CIA Headquarters on May 16, 1963, with
a number of CIA representatives participating from the DDP Staff.
This briefing included considerable information with respect to the
nature and level of Soviet espionage activities being conducted in
various areas of the world.)

BRIEFING OF BOARD'S COVERT ACTION PANEL
BY STATE DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVES

September 6, 1963

Mr. Murphy, Dr. Langer and Mr. Coyne met with Mr. Thomas
Hughes, Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research of
the Department of State on September 6, 1963, for a discussion of
several matters in the intelligence area.

With regard to covert action matters Mr. Hughes said that
his Bureau in the Department of State is responsible for coordin-
ating all NSC 5412/2 matters throughout the Department. Mr. Hughes
felt that this job was being performed satisfactorily but he
regreted that the State Department played a relatively minor role
in Special Group activities. Mr. Hughes also expressed concern
about the DCI's failure to provide sufficient time in advance of
Special Group meetings for the coordination of covert action pro-/
posals which are to be discussed at the meetings and concerning
which the Department of State has an interest.

In a discussion with Under Secretary Alexis Johnson, the
Panel was told that in Mr. Johnson's opinion CIA is now coordinating
its covert action programs with the appropriate elements of the
Department of State. He did comment, however, that new programs
are submitted to the Department at the very last moment, because
the Director of Central Intelligence wishes to sign off personally
on new covert action proposals before they are submitted to the
Department of State or to the Special Group.
:

Secretary Johnson, in reply to a question posed by the Panel,
said that the Special Group does not follow the general practice
of reviewing periodically the status of implementation of covert
action programs approved by the Special Group; and he thought it
would be a good idea to have such reviews made, possibly by the
Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the State Department.

EXCERPTS FROM MINUTES OF PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN
INTELLIGENCE ADVISORY BOARD MEETINGS WITH
RESPECT TO COVERT ACTIONS MATTERS

Meeting of May 15, 1961:

The then DCI, Mr. Allen Dulles, joined in a discussion of
the highlights of CIA's activities. In the covert actions field
Mr. Dulles suggested that the Board look into the future relation-
ship of CIA to paramilitary activities Mr. Dulles being of the
opinion that paramilitary operations should not be conducted by
the CIA. Mr. Dulles thought that the Board should look at such
CIA activities as the use of proprietary organizations including
Radio Free Europe, REA, the Afro-American Institute, and various
labor and youth groups. Mr. Dulles was asked whether a removal
of paramilitary activities from CIA responsibility would permit
a significant cut in the CIA budget and personnel figures, and
Mr. Dulles replied that such was not the case because of the
extensive activities being carried on by the International
Organizations Division of the DDP, and because of the many pro-
prietary activities in which CIA is involved. (Dr. Land said
that he was both shocked and indignant to learn that Radio Free
Europe is a proprietary organization of the CIA. Mr. Clifford
said that he had been on the Board of Directors of RFE for the
past three years and this was the first time he had known it
was connected with CIA. Mr. Dulles was asked what was the extent
of the knowledge of American business men concerning the RFE-CIA
connection and Mr. Dulles replied that certain American business
men are aware of the connection, but not the man-in-the-street
who makes dollar contributions to the tune of $3 million a year.)

Board Chairman Killian appointed himself and Messrs. Murphy,
Langer and Taylor to serve on a Panel of the Board to study the
extent to which the Government should be involved in political,
psychological, propaganda, and paramilitary activities; and the
policy which should be pursued by the U. S. Government in these
matters.

President Kennedy joined the Board meeting, and when the
discussion turned to a recommendation of the prior Board, the.
President referred to a recommendation that covert action
programs of the CIA may not have been worth the risk nor worth
the great expenditure of manpower and money; that CIA concentra-
tion on such activities had tended to detract substantially
from the execution of its primary intelligence-gathering mission;
and that there should be a total reassessment of U. S. covert
action policies and programs. The President indicated that
except for Laos and Cuba, he did not have extensive knowledge
of other covert operations being conducted by the CIA; he said
-

NW 185
Docld:2507
NWP1326
DocId:34671892 Page 7

that he had the feeling that someone in the White House should
be constantly in touch with and on top of covert operations;
and he observed that the Congress believes that someone in the
White House is keeping close watch on such matters. After a
discussion of the Indonesia situation, President Kennedy
thought that the Cuba fiasco was \"Indonesia all over again,
and he wondered if the Secretary of State and the Secretary
of Defense should not be better informed regarding these
matters. The President also expressed concern over the recent
development in Singapore which involved some bungled efforts
on the part of CIA to penetrate the Singapore police. Follow-
ing expressions of views by General Taylor, McGeorge Bundy,
and Mr. Gray, the President agreed that in addition to the
need for staffing of NSC 5412/2 matters, the President needed
to be kept informed with respect to these programs on a
continuing basis.

Meeting of May 26, 1961:

In this second meeting of the PFIAB the discussion in-
cluded a statement by General Doolittle that proposed
reorganization steps with respect to the CIA would involve
the question of the interference of covert operations with
intelligence collection. General Doolittle had found, he said,
that the \"covert operations dog is wagging the intelligence
tail\" when in fact this should be reversed. General Doolittle
added that a great number of people in the CIA are more
interested in the political, psychological, propaganda and
paramilitary than they are in the dry, difficult but important
task of collecting, interpreting and distributing intelligence--
a matter which General Doolittle thought could be corrected
by a change of emphasis and by a change in organization.

At one point in the meeting when the DCI, Mr. Allen Dulles,
was present, that official said that with respect to organiza-
tional matters he favored transferring paramilitary activities
to the Defense Department; he opposed the separation of other
covert action activities from foreign intelligence activities;
and he was opposed to separating the post of DCI from that of
Head of the CIA.

Meeting of June 7, 1961:

Upon the completion of its third meeting on June 7, 1961,
the Board met that evening with President Kennedy (the Attorney
General and Mr. McGeorge Bundy were also present.) In connection
with a statement by the President that he was receiving in-
adequate information concerning developments in a number of
countries, Board Chairman Killian said that it was the general

NW 185
Docld:2507
NW 88192
DocId:34671892 Page 8
2

consensus of the Board that the CIA was placing too much
stress upon covert action activities, with insufficient
emphasis placed upon the acquisition of intelligence.
Later in the discussion, Mr. McGeorge Bundy said that in
line with the President's wishes, a list was being prepared
of all programs involving covert support to political
parties abroad, and support to individuals associated with
political parties, with a view to assessing the direction
and value of those programs--Mr. Bundy noting that certain
of these problem areas which had been referred to by Ambassa-
dor Galbraith in connection with covert actions in India
had been recently reviewed by the Special NSC 5412/2 Group.
Board Chairman Killian informed the President that in the
Board's view the responsibilities of the U. S. Ambassadors
should be clarified to make sure that each Ambassador is
cognizant of the intelligence collection and covert action
activities which are conducted in or from his country of
assignment and for the purpose of assuring that such activities
are consistent with the over-all national security policies
of the President. Later on in the discussion, the President
commented on a suggestion that he not be publicly identified
with clandestine or covert action activities, saying that
he thought this raised a question about the desirability of
setting up on the White House staff a \"Special Assistant
for Intelligence.\" (Mr. Bundy thought it would be all right
to establish such a position, provided that the Special
Assistant was himself not publicly identified with any
responsibility for covert operations.)

Meeting of June 30-July 2, 1961:

A portion of this Board meeting was attended by Mr. Mc-
George Bundy who, at one point, read to the Board the letter
from President Kennedy appointing General Taylor as Military
Represent Representative. Mr. Bundy emphasized that General Taylor's
appointment was not exclusively military in character, for the
President desired that General Taylor counsel him with respect
to certain intelligence matters, and in the field of covert
action activities the President wished to look to General
Taylor for special guidance; and therefore the President had
appointed General Taylor to serve as Chairman of the Special
5412/2 Group. Mr. Bundy mentioned that recently a two-hour
briefing had been provided to the President, Mr. Bundy,
General Taylor and Mr. Coyne by Messrs. Dulles and Bissell
concerning major covert action programs currently being
carried out by the Agency.

At another point in the meeting the Board heard comments
from Mr. Roger Hilsman, Director of the Bureau of Intelligence
and Research at the Department of State. Among other things,
Mr. Hilsman felt that the U. S. Government was not making
full use of covert action operations in providing assistance
to foreign political parties. He thought that such opera-
tions were important and could be helpful if done skillfully.
Mr. Hilsman expressed criticism of the fact that the Depart-
ment of State was brought into CIA's planning in the NSC 5412/2
area only at the last moment, which made it difficult for
the State Department to take a position without knowledge
of the extent and nature of the CIA resources that would be.
involved. Mr. Hilsman went on to say that he favored reorgani-
zing the CIA along the general lines of the British Intelligence
System; he would place clandestine collection and covert
political action operations under the Department of State;
and he would require that the State Department exercise policy
control over all aspects of intelligence including political,
psychological, propaganda, paramilitary and related covert
activities.

Meeting of July 18, 1961:

In the course of this meeting, Mr. Bissell of CIA was
invited to discuss with Board members his views on possible
reorganization steps that might be taken with respect to the
CIA. At one point in the discussion Mr. Bissell volunteered
the suggestion that perhaps a step might be taken by the
President to obtain a better public understanding and acceptance
of the CIA's responsibilities. Mr. Bissell suggested that
perhaps the President could make an appropriate announcement
which would include recognition of the existence of the body
known as the Special NSC 5412/2 Group, telling of the Group's
duties and who compose it, without giving the public any
information on the actual nature of the covert operations per-
formed by the CIA.

Meeting of October 16-17, 1961
し

During the Board meeting of October 16-17, 1961
the Director of Central Intelligence, Mr. Allen Dulles,
commented that the \"principle of compartmentation\" was being
violated by CIA in its dealings with the PFIAB because of
the CIA's effort to meet the convenience of the Board.
Mr. Dulles said that one example of this was the action taken
by CIA in furnishing the detailed compilation concerning the
proprietary and other cover organizations with which CIA
has dealings in its covert action programs. Mr. Coyne
observed that material received by the Board from the CIA,
and more sensitive information received from other U. S.
intelligence agencies, is given a greater degree of security
in the Board than in the CIA itself. (For use at this Board
meeting a 17-page summary had been prepared in the Board's
offices based on an undated document from CIA marked
\"Top Secret--Eyes Only--Extremely Sensitive\" containing a
listing and brief description of all CIA cover organizations
and proprietary activities, including references to the Asia
Foundation, Radio Free Europe, Institute of National Labor
Research, World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching
Profession, U. S. National Student Association, and many others.)

Mr. Dulles told the Board that the CIA can play a help-
ful but relatively modest, role with regard to the Laos and
South Vietnam problems, and he thought it would be well if
the Board would suggest ways in which the CIA could more
effectively utilize its resources in meeting such problems.
The DCI observed that the CIA must do more in all covert
action fields because the U. S. faces the most formidable
covert action apparatus ever seen. He said that this apparatus
is the most effective one ever established, and the U. S.
has nothing like it.

During an executive session on October 17, 1961, Board
Chairman Killian suggested that Board members give serious
thought to the CIA's use of Foundations as covers for operations,
and he cited the Asia Foundation and the International Com-
mission of Jurists as examples. Dr. Killian felt that there
is danger that the entire Foundation systems in the U. S.
would be discredited if there were a disclosure of CIA'S
connection with them. It was Dr. Killian's view that the
CIA should not place clandestine cover on any student,

NW 185
Docld:2507
NWP&1321(
DocId:34671892 Page 11
-5-

NW 185
and he felt that it would be very serious should it become
known that the National Student Federation, for example,
was being financed by CIA as a cover organization. Dr. Langerl
expressed agreement with this, but felt that CIA would be
justified in using foundations as a cover in combatting
communist influence in such activities as labor unions.
Mr. Clifford thought that perhaps Dr. Killian's concern with
regard to educational foundations might be possibly met by the
use of cut-off organizations between the CIA and the foundations,
as a means of concealing CIA financial support to the foundations.
Mr. Coyne reminded Board members of the Board's recommendation
of last July, that all existing covert action programs be
reviewed by the Special NSC 5412/2 Group. In answer to a
question from General Doolittle, Mr. Coyne told the Board that
written summaries which had been furnished to the Board members
concerning CIA's cover organization activities, were being
given special security handling and strict accountability.

The Board meeting was joined by CIA representatives
Lyman Kirkpatrick, Richard Helms, Cord Meyer, and others, for
an oral presentation and discussion with respect to CIA cover
organizations, including commercial organizations and such
foundation-supported student groups as the National Student's
Federation. After Mr. Helms had discussed the use of non-
official covers for individual CIA personnel, Mr. Cord Meyer
described the CIA's use of foundations and proprietary
organizations. Mr. Meyer then described such large scale
CIA cover organizations as Radio Free Europe (where the objective
is propaganda) and other organizations which CIA directs against
Soviet front organizations (where the effort is to exert
influence and at the same time do genuine work for the benefit
of the cover organization and its program, as in the case of
the Asia Foundation and the Afro-American Institute which are
based in the U. S. and whose activities are subject to CIA
influence in the form of money and a degree of policy direction).
rganizations

In answer to questions from Board members as to the danger
of a disclosure of CIA's relationship to these various founda-
tions, Mr. Meyer said that there was no grave danger of a
\"cultural U-2 incident\", and the risk of a disclosure, by a
defector, for example, was less than the risk of a U. S. news
story or a disclosure resulting from gossip among members of
the U. S. \"foundation community\". Mr. Meyer considered it
inevitable that the Asian mentality would suspect that there
is U. S. government influence in all U. S. based foundations;
Chinese communist propaganda continually charges that U. S.
government or Wall Street control exists in these foundations,
even in the Ford Foundation where this is not the case;
C

L
nevertheless the cover foundations which are in fact influenced
by CIA continue to do legitimate work as, for example, in the
case of a labor training school supported by the Asia Founda-
tion in Pakistan, and in the case of a teacher-training grant
at the University of Rangoon; and in the case of the National
Student's Federation, Mr. Meyer pointed out that CIA financial
support is normally funneled through a variety of channels
and CIA money goes to the National Educational Association through
a cut-out arrangement. Mr. Meyer expressed the opinion that
CIA's budgetary control over the use of moneys contributed to
international student groups would deter any effort to impose-
foreign influence upon U. S. student organizations.

Mr. Meyer informed the Board that CIA cover organization
activities are approved by the CIA Project Review Committee
with the State Department being made knowledgeable. Mr. Helms
stated that since January 20, 1961, there had been no review.
of such activities by the NSC nor by the Special NSC 5412/2
Group.

Next the Board was briefed by CIA representatives Amory,
Breitweiser, and others concerning CIA paramilitary involve-
ment in Laos and South Vietnam (in the latter country this
activity included ground reconnaissance teams and intelligence
teams, and a recent requirement on CIA \"to harrass Soviet air
drops of supplies\" in the Southeast Asia area).

When the Board met with President Kennedy, on the after-
noon of October 17, 1961, the Chairman read to the President
the text of the Board's report on paramilitary activities, and
he mentioned to the President the highlights of presentations
which the Board had heard earlier that day concerning develop-
ments in Laos. The President directed Mr. Coyne to discuss
this subject with Mr. McGeorge Bundy, with a view to a review
of paramilitary activities in Laos, to be conducted by the
Special NSC 5412/2 Group (this was discussed by Mr. Coyne
with Mr. Bundy who said that he would have the review made of
the paramilitary activity in Laos and the question as to
whether the responsibility for the activity was properly.
assigned to the CIA).

:
Meeting of December 9, 1961

During this meeting of the Board an opportunity was
given to Mr. Gray to present some of the highlights of
Mr. Gray's and Mr. Coyne's findings in the course of their
on-the-scene review of U. S. foreign intelligence activities
in seven Middle East countries. One of the recommendations
of Mr. Gray's report to the Board, which the Board subsequently
adopted and submitted to the President, called for a review
of NSC 5412/2 and related NSC Intelligence Directives to
insure that adequate guidance is given to Ambassadors and
CIA Station Chiefs with respect to covert actions generally;
and that the station in Cyprus be reviewed with a view to
placing increased emphasis on covert operations, particularly
in the newspaper and trade unions fields, with appropriate support
to be furnished by the CIA stations in Athens and Ankara.
Subsequently, at the request of General Taylor, Mr. Gray and
Mr. Coyne briefed the Special NSC 5412/2 Group concerning
covert action-related matters which had been reviewed during
the Middle East trip.

Meeting of January 19-20, 1962

In the course of this Board meeting discussions were
had with the newly-appointed DCI, Mr. John McCone. During
a discussion of possible ways to reorganize and strengthen
the CIA, the DCI said that he might decide to separate the
functions of the DD/P area within the CIA. Mr. McCone thought
that he might possibly name one assistant who would specialize
in \"conventional covert operations\", including the management
of the clandestine services world-wide, and designate another
assistant in the DD/P area who would be in charge of such
matters as COMINT, ELINT, satellite reconnaissance, etc.
Mr. McCone added that he thought he would pick a military
man to head up covert operations and to handle paramilitary
activities in order that these functions would be conducted
on an absolutely professional basis, without disturbing the
lines running from the DD/P to the CIA Station Chiefs.

Further on in the discussion with the DCI, Mr. McCone
expressed concern over the fact that in the CIA organizational
responsibility for financing was placed at a rather low level
in the headquarters organizational set-up, and therefore the
DCI desired to place this responsibility upon a higher level
official who would serve as Comptroller in the Office of the
DCI. Mr. Gray asked whether this would increase problems

NW 185
Docld:2507
NWP1321:
DocId:34671892 Page 14

with the Bureau of the Budget if the DCI made the Comptroller
responsible for all funding, including covert operations;
and the DCI replied that in his opinion he could compart-
mentalize the work of the Comptroller in a way which would
facilitate dealing with the Bureau of the Budget concerning
covert action matters.

Meeting of March 23-24, 1962

During a discussion in Executive Session, Board
Chairman Killian noted that President Kennedy had accepted
the Board's recommendations concerning a re-definition of
the role of the DCI, and regarding reorganization of the CIA.
Dr. Killian thought that the point had now been reached in
the Board's efforts when it should serve the President by
examining selected areas of the government's intelligence
effort, and he mentioned as an example, covert actions carried
out under NSC 5412/2.

At another point in the Board meeting, Chairman Killian
again pointed out that there was a need for the Board to
explore thoroughly the activities being carried out in the
NSC 5412/2 area; Dr. Killian thought that a general session
with General Taylor at the next Board meeting would give the
Board an opportunity to become acquainted with the present
status of the specific programs being carried out under the
Special NSC 5412/2 Group; the Chairman thought that it would
be advantageous if the DCI were present at such a Board
meeting; and Dr. Killian added that the Board lacks clear
information on covert action programs with respect to Cuba.

Later on in the meeting, the Chairman made several
Panel assignments to various Board members. Dr. Langer was
asked to obtain information concerning covert actions being
carried out under auspices of the Special NSC 5412/2 Group,
in order that the Board might be informed in depth with regard
to such activities. The Chairman said that Dr. Langer's
report to the Board should include information concerning
covert actions with respect to Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and
Guatemala, among other countires.

In another reference to covert action matters, during
an Executive Session of this Board meeting Mr. Coyne suggested
that consideration be given to having one or more of the Board
members take an on-the-scene look at covert operations which
are being carried out abroad, particularly in South America.
Dr. Killian agreed that this should be done.

Meeting of May 11-12, 1962

During this meeting, Board Chairman Killian reported
to the Board concerning a talk he had had with Mr. McGeorge
Bundy about the role of the President's Board. It was
NW 185

DocId:34671892 Page 16

/

Mr. Bundy's view that the Board must continue to keep
itself fully informed about the foreign intelligence program,
and Mr. Bundy emphasized the need for the Board to be com-
pletely informed regarding covert action operations taking
place in the NSC 5412/2 area.

In an Executive Session, Mr. Coyne reported on a dis-
cussion which he had had with the newly-appointed DCI,
Mr. McCone, for the purpose of outlining the various Board
Panel assignments, and for the further purpose of scheduling
CIA briefings for the members of the various Board Panels.
Mr. Coyne reported that the DCI's reaction was to indicate
his belief that the Board Panel activities seemed to be con-
cerned with matters which were appropriate for the DCI
himself to pursue. Chairman Killian said that following this
discussion between Mr. Coyne and the DCI, Dr. Killian had
contacted the Deputy DCI, General Carter, to pursue the
request that CIA furnish briefings to the various Board
Panels. General Carter replied to Chairman Killian that the
DCI wanted to hold up on such briefings, for example, the
briefing of the Board Panel on NSC 5412/2 activities, because
the reorganization process was still underway in CIA.
Chairman Killian also reported that when he contacted General
Carter a week later on this same subject, it appeared that
the CIA was reluctant to furnish the desired briefings, but
Chairman Killian took a firm stand in requesting them.

During an Executive Session, Chairman Killian asked
for suggestions concerning subject matters to be discussed
with the DCI when that official joined the Board meeting the
following day. With respect to the Langer-Gray-Murphy Panel,
Dr. Langer said he had no particular questions to raise with
the DCI concerning activities carried out under the NSC 5412/2
Group. Dr. Langer observed that he was impressed by the way
the Special Group checks up on the implementation of covert
operations. Chairman Killian referred to various indications
he had received that General Taylor was doing a very good job
in this respect. Mr. Gray thought that if the Board is going
to try to protect the President in this particular area, the
Board must have a better flow of information to the Board con-
cerning NSC 5412/2 activities, in order that the Board may make
a necessary evaluation of the covert action programs involved.
Chairman Killian agreed with a suggestion by Mr. Coyne that
the Board Panel on NSC 5412/2 activities should remain in
existence on a continuing basis in order that the Board might
NW 185
Docld:2507
NW 8899
DocId:34671892 Page 17
-
11

be kept informed concerning these activities.

Dr. Killian remarked to Dr. Langer that the Board
Panel on NSC 5412/2 matters should conduct a continuing
review, with the objective of the Panel becoming fully
informed regarding covert action programs, following which
the Board would determine the next step to be taken.

Meeting of June 25-26, 1962

In Executive Session Chairman Killian informed Board
members that recently there had been scheduled a CIA briefing
of the Board Panel on covert action programs. However, the
day before the briefing was to have been given by CIA officials
Chairman Killian received a telephone call from the DCI,
Mr. McCone, who said that he hesitated to provide the in-
formation requested by the Board Panel because only the
President was privy to some of the covert operations involved
Mr. McCone told Chairman Killian that he had discussed this
matter with the President who had concurred in the DCI'S
suggestion that the briefing of the Board Panel be limited
to procedural aspects of the Special NSC 5412/2 Group.
Dr. Killian's reply to the DCI was to the effect that this
would be a waste of time because the Board was already fully
informed concerning these procedural matters, and therefore
the Chairman expressed his intention to discuss this matter
with the President, and the DCI indicated that he favored
this course of action. Thereafter, Chairman Killian discussed
the problem with Mr. McGeorge Bundy who felt that under the
Board's Directive it should have full information in order to
carry out its duties. Continuing his report to the Board,
Dr. Killian said that on the preceding evening he had dined
with the DCI who on this occasion said that he was prepared
to give the Board whatever information it needs, including
information on CIA operations in the covert action field.
The Chairman added that Mr. McCone planned to brief the Panel
himself from a book prepared for the first time in CIA with
regard to all of the activities involved. Mr. Gray stated
that the ability of the Board to get complete information
concerning covert action activities was essential if the Board
were to be able to discharge its responsibility to the President.
Mr. Clifford thought that the gravity of this issue with the
DCI was such that it warranted mention to the President when
the Board met with the President the following day, and the
President should be told the background of the problem and how
the matter had been resolved.
