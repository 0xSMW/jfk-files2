  "summary": "The documents refer to 'Soviet Agents' primarily in the context of FBI and CIA counterintelligence activities. These agents were targets of FBI mail interception programs and telephone tap operations (Project LIFEAT) aimed at gathering intelligence in locations like Mexico City. The documents also reveal concerns about protecting the identities of Soviet agents in the context of releasing JFK assassination-related documents. Additionally, there are alleged connections between the CIA, Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation, and individuals linked to Soviet agents, indicating potential areas of investigation and security concerns. The timeline spans from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, with a later reference in the 1990s regarding document release policies.",
