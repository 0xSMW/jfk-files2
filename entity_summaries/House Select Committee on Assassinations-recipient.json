  "summary": "The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) is mentioned in three documents, though the documents themselves do not directly detail the HSCA's activities or findings. The documents span from 1962 to 1978, with one document from 1978 being the closest in time to the HSCA's investigation into the JFK assassination. The documents cover a range of topics including personnel actions within the CIA, interactions with Soviet officials in Mexico, and information on Cuban exile leader Manuel Ray. The HSCA likely received these documents or information as part of its investigation into the JFK assassination, but the documents themselves do not provide specific details about the HSCA's role or findings.",
