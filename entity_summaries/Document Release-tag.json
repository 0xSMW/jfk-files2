  "summary": "Document Release, as a tag, appears in the context of various processes and concerns related to the declassification and public disclosure of documents, particularly those pertaining to the JFK assassination and other sensitive matters. The documents highlight the complexities involved in releasing information, including navigating FOIA requests, addressing concerns from foreign intelligence services (like the British SIS), and ensuring compliance with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The process involves reviewing documents, identifying potentially sensitive information, consulting with relevant parties, and making determinations about what can be released to the public. The documents also reveal concerns about the potential impact of document releases on individuals (such as former CIA employees) and international relations (specifically with Australia).",
