  "significance": "Richardson Preyer's significance in the JFK context, based on these documents, is tied to his likely membership in the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), which investigated the assassination. The documents themselves focus on the administrative aspects of the HSCA, such as payroll and privacy concerns, rather than direct investigative findings. Therefore, his significance is more related to the overall functioning and administration of the HSCA rather than a specific role in uncovering new information about the assassination.",
