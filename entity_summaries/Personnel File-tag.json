  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, personnel files are significant because they may contain information about individuals who were potentially involved in events related to the assassination, either directly or indirectly. These files could reveal details about their backgrounds, assignments, and connections, which might shed light on the CIA's activities and knowledge related to the assassination. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) reviewed some of these files, indicating their relevance to the investigation. The files can help researchers understand the roles and responsibilities of CIA personnel during the relevant time period and assess whether any individuals had motives or opportunities related to the assassination.",
