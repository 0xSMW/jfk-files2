  "summary": "The JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was established to oversee the declassification and release of government documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The ARRB interacted extensively with the CIA, FBI, and other agencies to review and release documents while balancing national security concerns. Key issues included security clearances for ARRB members, the potential release of sensitive information such as CIA station locations and personnel names, and the protection of ongoing intelligence operations and relationships with foreign governments. The CIA, in particular, expressed concerns about the ARRB's release of information that could compromise intelligence sources, methods, and relationships. The ARRB's activities spanned from at least 1993 to 1998, focusing on ensuring transparency while addressing the CIA's concerns about potential damage to national security.",
