  "summary": "The entity \"All Staff\" refers to the employees of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The documents primarily concern the payroll records of HSCA staff members, including individuals such as William K. Triplett, Michael Ewing, Lisa M. Berlow, and William A. Webb. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) reviewed these records and issued Final Determination Notifications, often postponing the release of Social Security numbers to protect personal privacy. The documents include payroll authorization forms and related memoranda detailing staff appointments, salaries, and employment information. A notable pattern across the documents is the ARRB's consistent redaction of Social Security numbers from the payroll records due to privacy concerns.",
