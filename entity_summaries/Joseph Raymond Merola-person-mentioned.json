  "summary": "Joseph Raymond Merola is identified as a suspect in an armed robbery who claimed connections to the CIA and involvement in supplying arms to anti-Castro groups. An FBI teletype indicates that while the CIA denied any operational interest in Merola, his boat was linked to anti-Castro operations. The other documents do not directly relate to Merola, but rather focus on Franc Pecar, a Yugoslav trade official, and his potential defection to the U.S., along with related communications between the CIA and FBI regarding Pecar's travel plans and potential recruitment.",
