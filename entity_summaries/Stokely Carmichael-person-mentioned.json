  "summary": "Stokely Carmichael, a prominent figure in the Civil Rights Movement and later the Black Power movement, is mentioned in several documents within this collection. While the documents primarily focus on Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination and related investigations, Carmichael's name appears in the context of monitoring individuals and groups critical of the FBI and CIA, as well as in connection to Bobby Seale and the Black Panther Party. The documents suggest that Carmichael was a subject of interest to intelligence agencies during the late 1960s, likely due to his activism and association with groups considered potentially subversive. However, the documents do not directly link Carmichael to the JFK assassination.",
