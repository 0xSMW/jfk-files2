  "summary": "The documents reference sworn statements in the context of investigations and information gathering. Victor Lee Trinkala provided a sworn statement on February 19, 1970, to the 108th MI Group regarding his discharge from the Army and connections to Richard Nagell. This statement was part of an inquiry into Trinkala's character and loyalty, as indicated by an agent report from the same date. Another sworn statement, dated October 3, 1982, involves Henry D. Glaister authorizing the release of an agent report about Joseph Timothy White to his father, Norval White Jr. The sworn statements appear to be used as official records of testimony or authorization within investigative or administrative processes.",
