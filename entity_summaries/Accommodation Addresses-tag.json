  "summary": "Accommodation addresses, in the context of these documents, appear to be addresses used by agents, particularly in covert operations, to provide a safe or anonymous location. They are mentioned in relation to CIA activities, specifically concerning agents dispatched to Cuba from Mexico in 1961 and in the broader context of assassination records related to the JFK assassination. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was involved in discussions regarding the release of information pertaining to these addresses, balancing transparency with the need to protect sensitive intelligence methods and potentially ongoing operations. There was concern about potential damage to diplomatic relations, litigation, and intelligence collection methods if these addresses were disclosed. Some accommodation addresses were also cancelled, as indicated in a 1961 memorandum.",

  "significance": "Accommodation addresses are significant in the JFK context because their potential disclosure was a point of contention between the CIA and the ARRB. The CIA sought to postpone the release of information related to these addresses, citing concerns about protecting intelligence sources and methods. This highlights the tension between transparency and national security interests in the release of assassination-related documents. The use of accommodation addresses also suggests the clandestine nature of some operations potentially related to the assassination or events leading up to it.",
