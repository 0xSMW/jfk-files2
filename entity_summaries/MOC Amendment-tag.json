  "summary": "MOC (Memorandum of Oral Commitment) Amendments pertain to modifications of agreements, specifically regarding individuals working with JMWAVE. These amendments primarily involve adjustments to salary, funding mechanisms, and tax obligations. The documents highlight changes in compensation, such as salary increases due to dependents or shifts in how payments are processed, like moving individuals to the JMWAVE payroll with tax deductions instead of requiring covert income tax returns. These amendments ensure that operational commitments are updated and reflect the current circumstances of the individuals involved.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, MOC Amendments themselves do not directly relate to the assassination. However, they provide insight into the operational and financial aspects of individuals working with or for organizations like JMWAVE, which may have indirect connections to events surrounding the assassination. Understanding the financial and operational relationships within these organizations could potentially shed light on individuals or activities of interest.",
