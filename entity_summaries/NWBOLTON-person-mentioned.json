  "summary": "NWBOLTON is a person mentioned in several CIA documents related to the JFK assassination. The documents suggest that some individuals, such as LPAVERT, suspected NWBOLTON of involvement in President Kennedy's assassination. One document mentions concerns about LPAVERT's views on NWBOLTON's alleged involvement, leading to changes in plans for using LPAVERT in sensitive communications. Another document references a Rio <JFK> conference, suspected to be an anti-NWBOLTON propaganda effort by the Cubans. While the documents mention NWBOLTON in the context of the JFK assassination, they do not provide conclusive evidence of their involvement, but rather reflect suspicions and concerns held by others.",
