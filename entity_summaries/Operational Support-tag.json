  "summary": "The documents highlight \"Operational Support\" primarily in the context of JMWAVE's activities in Miami during the 1960s and 1970s. This support encompasses various forms, including intelligence gathering, propaganda dissemination through journalists like AMCARBON-1/AMCARDON-1 of The Miami Herald, and liaison with local law enforcement agencies. JMWAVE utilized these connections for operational purposes, intelligence, and as a propaganda outlet, while also protecting KUBARK's operations in South Florida. The Minsk Station Activity Report also mentions general operational support as part of its activities in October 1996. The documents reveal a pattern of the CIA, specifically JMWAVE, leveraging external resources and relationships to facilitate its operations.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the significance of \"Operational Support\" lies in understanding the operational capabilities and networks that the CIA, particularly JMWAVE, had established. While the documents do not directly link operational support to the assassination, they illustrate the CIA's capacity to influence media, gather intelligence, and collaborate with local authorities, which could be relevant when investigating potential connections or cover-ups related to the event. The use of journalists for propaganda and intelligence purposes is a notable aspect.",
