  "summary": "Manuel Artime, also known as AMBIDDY-1, was a Cuban exile leader involved in CIA operations. The documents indicate that the CIA monitored Artime's activities and communications, including installing audio surveillance at a safehouse in Bethesda, Maryland, to track his interactions with other individuals like Rafael Aurelio Quintero Ibarbia. The documents span from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, detailing his involvement in arms dealings, political maneuverings related to Cuba, Central America, and Haiti, and his contacts with other individuals. One document mentions a double agent (K-1) working to gather intelligence on Cuban exiles and potentially compromise Cuban officials through monitored communications involving Artime.",
