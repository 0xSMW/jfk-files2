  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, foreign policy is significant as it provides the backdrop against which decisions were made regarding Cuba and Vietnam, two regions of intense focus during Kennedy's presidency. The documents suggest potential motives for actors, both domestic and foreign, who may have opposed Kennedy's policies. The documents also highlight the tensions and debates within the administration regarding the conduct of foreign policy and the role of intelligence agencies, which could have contributed to a climate of conflict and dissent.",
