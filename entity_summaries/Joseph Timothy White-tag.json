  "summary": "Joseph Timothy White is a PFC who reportedly defected to North Korea. The documents primarily concern efforts to gather information about White's background, personality, and associations, particularly during his time at Kemper Military School & College (KMSC). An agent report details an interview with Henry D. Glaister concerning White, focusing on White's background, associations, and political views during his time at KMSC. Another document involves obtaining written permission from Henry D. Glaister to release a previous agent report about White to White's father, Norval White Jr. The documents suggest an investigation into White's background and potential motivations, possibly related to his alleged defection.",
