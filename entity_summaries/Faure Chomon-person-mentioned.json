  "summary": "Faure Chomon is mentioned in the context of meetings with AMLASH-1 in Paris during late January and early February 1965. The documents discuss security implications related to a captured infiltrator named Modesto Orlando Orozco Basulto, resupply of materials, potential recruitments, upcoming elections, and information on Cuban officials. One document also mentions a purge of Cuban officials and military officers in 1966, suggesting Chomon was likely a Cuban official or military officer. The documents indicate that AMLASH-1 was providing information on Cuban officials, which would include Faure Chomon.",
