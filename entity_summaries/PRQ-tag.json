  "summary": "PRQ stands for Personal Record Questionnaire. The documents indicate that PRQs were used by the CIA to gather and record detailed information about individuals, including biographical data, operational history, potential motivations, intelligence connections, and security considerations. These questionnaires were used for both assets (like CREBORY/1) and individuals being investigated or considered for operational roles (like Reinaldo Pico Ramon, AMICE/31, and Harold R. NOFMAYR). The documents span from 1958 to 1965, suggesting a period of active use of PRQs. The documents highlight the importance of PRQs in documenting and tracking individuals involved in CIA operations and investigations.",
