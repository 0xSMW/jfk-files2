  "summary": "BKHERALD appears to be a media outlet or organization, possibly a newspaper, that the CIA interacted with in various ways. The documents suggest the CIA used BKHERALD as a platform for publishing information, but also exercised caution regarding the sources and content published. There was a concern about publishing material from certain sources due to existing liaison equities and the source's un-surfaced status. One document mentions an individual offering services to BKHERALD, while another references a former staff employee. The documents span from 1973 to 1976, indicating a period of CIA engagement with this entity. The documents do not explicitly mention the JFK assassination.",
