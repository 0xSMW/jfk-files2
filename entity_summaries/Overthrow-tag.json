  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the 'Overthrow' tag highlights the CIA's involvement in regime change operations and plots against foreign leaders, particularly in Cuba (Castro) and Vietnam (Diem). This context is relevant as it provides insight into the political climate and the types of covert actions the US government was willing to undertake during this period, which could potentially be linked to the assassination, especially considering the existing theories about CIA involvement.",
