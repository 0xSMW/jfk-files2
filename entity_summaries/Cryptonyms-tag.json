  "summary": "Cryptonyms, aliases, and project code names were used by the CIA to protect the identities of individuals, assets, and operations, particularly in sensitive contexts such as Cuban-related activities and the JFK assassination. The CIA's use of cryptonyms became a point of focus during investigations by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and later the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), which requested lists of cryptonyms and information related to their usage. The CIA balanced transparency with the need to protect covert employees, cover mechanisms, and ongoing intelligence operations when deciding how much information about cryptonyms to release. The documents reveal that the CIA had internal guidelines for handling cryptonyms in JFK assassination records, including decisions on redaction and release.",

  "significance": "In the JFK assassination context, cryptonyms are significant because they represent a layer of secrecy and obfuscation surrounding individuals and operations potentially related to the assassination. The debate over releasing information about cryptonyms highlights the tension between transparency and national security concerns. The ARRB's requests for information on cryptonyms and the CIA's responses reveal the extent to which the CIA sought to control the narrative and protect its sources and methods.",
