  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, Duong Van Minh's significance lies in his role in the coup that led to the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem in November 1963. The US government's involvement in or awareness of this coup has been a subject of historical debate and scrutiny. Minh's leadership in the coup places him at the center of a pivotal event in the lead-up to the JFK assassination, as the instability and political changes in South Vietnam were critical factors in shaping US foreign policy and involvement in the region.",
