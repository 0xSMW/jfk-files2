  "summary": "Gary Hart is mentioned in three documents. However, none of the documents directly relate to the JFK assassination. One document is a transcript from a 1976 Senate Select Committee hearing discussing the covert use of media and academics by the CIA. Another focuses on providing information to the U.S. Senate Select Committee (SSC) concerning Martin Luther King, Jr., and Stanley Levison's alleged ties to the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). The third discusses Senator Walter Mondale's planned trip to inspect CIA covert intelligence sites in Europe, the concerns it raised with the White House, and a briefing for the SSC on how National Intelligence Estimates are prepared. The documents suggest Gary Hart was likely involved in or associated with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) during the 1970s, but the specific nature of his role is not detailed within these documents.",
