  "summary": "Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto was a Mexican diplomat suspected by the CIA of having ties to the Soviet Union and involvement in financing Communist activities. In 1961, the CIA sought permission from the FBI to share information about Espinosa y Prieto with German authorities. However, the FBI responded that their files did not support the claim that he knowingly financed communist activities, advising against including this allegation in a summary to the Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz (BFV) in Germany. The documents suggest that intelligence agencies were investigating Espinosa y Prieto's potential connections to individuals and activities of interest, including black market currency exchange, although the extent and validity of these connections were questioned.",
