These assignments involve individuals being stationed in various international locations for operational purposes. The documents include a temporary suspension of a reinvestigation due to an individual's overseas assignment (Boris Dimitri Tarasoff), and requests for Permanent Change of Station (PCS) overseas evaluations for Operations Officers (Joseph S. Piccolo and Calvin W. Hicks) being reassigned to locations such as Managua, Nicaragua, and La Paz, Bolivia. The timeline spans from 1966 to 1968, indicating ongoing personnel deployments during this period. A notable pattern is the focus on Operations Officers being assigned to different countries, suggesting a network of international operations.",
