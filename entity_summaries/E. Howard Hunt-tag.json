The documents reveal investigations into his activities, particularly during his assignment in Madrid in the mid-1960s, focusing on financial transactions and operational roles. He is also connected to the Watergate break-in, with reports detailing CIA connections to individuals and organizations involved. A CIA memorandum discusses his alias birth certificate (Edward Joseph Hamilton) issued for the Bay of Pigs operation. Hunt's memoirs, \"Undercover,\" were reviewed by the CIA for security concerns, leading to deletions of sensitive information. He testified before the Senate Select Committee regarding inquiries into potential CIA involvement in assassinations. The documents also mention his involvement with individuals connected to the CIA station in Mexico City during Lee Harvey Oswald's visit.",
