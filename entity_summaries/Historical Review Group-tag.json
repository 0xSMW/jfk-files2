The HRG's role includes locating, reviewing, and processing documents for release, while also addressing concerns about protecting covert employees' identities, cover mechanisms, and ongoing intelligence operations. They interacted with the ARRB to fulfill information requests, address concerns about deadlines, and negotiate the protection of sensitive information, such as CIA employees' names. The HRG also coordinated with other agencies like the FBI regarding document release and informant protection. Their involvement spans from at least 1992 to 1997, focusing on balancing transparency with national security concerns.",
