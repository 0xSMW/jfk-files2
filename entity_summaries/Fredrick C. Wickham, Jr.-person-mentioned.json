  "summary": "Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. appears in several CIA memoranda related to the release of JFK assassination records. The documents suggest Wickham was involved in the CIA's efforts to manage the release of information, particularly concerning the protection of covert employees' identities, cover mechanisms, and ongoing intelligence operations. The CIA was concerned about protecting a larger number of names, especially those with little connection to the JFK assassination story. Wickham's role seems to be related to the CIA's internal discussions and negotiations with the ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board) regarding redactions and the extent of information to be released. One document mentions the protection of 'a good KUBARK asset' related to ERTHYROID/3, suggesting Wickham may have been involved in protecting assets and their relationships with the CIA.",
