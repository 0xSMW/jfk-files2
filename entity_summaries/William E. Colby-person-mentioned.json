  "significance": "While the documents do not directly implicate William E. Colby in the JFK assassination, his role as DCI and the inventory of Rockefeller Commission files suggest a potential connection to investigations surrounding the assassination. The Rockefeller Commission was tasked with investigating CIA activities, and its files included documents related to the Kennedy assassination, indicating that Colby, as DCI, would have been aware of and potentially involved in these investigations.",
