  "summary": "The documents refer to 'Agent' in the context of CIA operations and intelligence gathering. Agents are individuals employed by the CIA for various tasks, including intelligence collection, infiltration, and operational support. Their activities range from providing information on Cuban military activities and Soviet ship arrivals to participating in projects like HUMANOID in Costa Rica. The documents highlight the importance of security, cover employment, and communication plans for agents operating in sensitive environments, such as Havana. Agents are also subject to security clearances, evaluations, and monitoring to ensure their reliability and suitability for assignments. The timeline of involvement varies depending on the specific agent and operation, spanning from the 1950s to the 1970s. A notable pattern across the documents is the emphasis on maintaining secrecy and managing the risks associated with agent activities.",

While these documents do not directly link any agent to the assassination, they illustrate the operational environment and the types of activities that CIA agents were engaged in during the relevant period. The documents highlight the CIA's network of informants and operatives, some of whom may have had knowledge or involvement in events related to the assassination.",
