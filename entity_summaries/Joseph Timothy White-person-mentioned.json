Glaister concerning White, focusing on White's background, associations, and political views during his time at KMSC. There is also a re-contact of Henry D. Glaister to obtain written permission for the release of a previous agent report concerning Joseph T. White to White's father.

However, the investigation into his background and reported defection to North Korea suggests potential counterintelligence concerns during the Cold War era, which may have been relevant to broader security investigations at the time, though a direct link to the JFK assassination is not evident from these documents alone.",
