  "summary": "Franc Pecar was a Yugoslav trade official in 1963 who was of interest to both the CIA and the FBI. The CIA believed Pecar might want to defect to the U.S. and requested information from the FBI. The FBI, however, advised against the CIA approaching Pecar, citing concerns from New York informants and a recent denial of clearance in a similar case. Pecar's travel plans included meetings in Miami, including one with Assistant Attorney General William Kenny, and a possible recruitment attempt was planned during a visit to Vienna. Ultimately, Pecar was recalled to Yugoslavia.",
