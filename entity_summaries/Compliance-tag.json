  "summary": "In the context of the JFK assassination records, \"Compliance\" refers to the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) adherence to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) played a crucial role in overseeing and evaluating the CIA's compliance, requesting additional information, records, and compliance statements to ensure the completeness and accessibility of relevant materials. The documents highlight the interactions between the CIA and the ARRB, including meetings to discuss the ARRB's compliance review, efforts to locate and declassify documents, and correspondence outlining requests for information. The timeline spans from 1995 to 1997, reflecting the period when the ARRB actively sought to ensure the CIA's fulfillment of its obligations under the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act. A notable pattern is the ARRB's persistent efforts to obtain further information and records from the CIA, indicating a focus on thoroughness and transparency in the declassification process.",
