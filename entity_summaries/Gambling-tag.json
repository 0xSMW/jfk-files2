  "summary": "The documents suggest that gambling, specifically bolita rackets and casino management, was an area of interest in relation to Cuban activities and individuals potentially connected to the CIA. Luis Alberto Condom Cajigal and Alvaro Martin Fernandez Fox were linked to gambling and bolita rackets in a 1963 FBI memorandum. Gordon Cooper's association with Casino Management International (CMI) is noted in a 1972 memo. Additionally, INS file reviews mention Benny Binion, Joe Campisi, and Joseph Civello, all with backgrounds in gambling, indicating a broader interest in individuals involved in this activity. The documents do not explicitly link gambling directly to the JFK assassination, but rather highlight its relevance in the context of Cuban activities, potential CIA connections, and organized crime figures.",
