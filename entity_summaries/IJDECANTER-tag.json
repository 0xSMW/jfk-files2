  "summary": "IJDECANTER is a CIA cryptonym that the CIA sought to protect from release in JFK assassination records. The CIA argued that disclosing IJDECANTER would benefit Russian counterintelligence and damage U.S. intelligence interests. The ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board) was involved in discussions with the CIA regarding the release of information related to the JFK assassination, including the handling of cryptonyms like IJDECANTER. One document identifies a source in relation to Lee Harvey Oswald's time in the Soviet Union, which is connected to a request related to IJDECANTER.",
