  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, the significance of SSCSGO is related to the historical context of investigations into intelligence activities during the 1970s. The documents do not directly mention the JFK assassination. However, the Church Committee investigated a broad range of CIA activities, some of which may have been tangentially related to the environment and context surrounding the assassination. The tag itself serves as an organizational tool for these documents.",
