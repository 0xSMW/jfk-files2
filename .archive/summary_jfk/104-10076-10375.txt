Intelligence gathered from local informants confirms that Cuban militia have intensified surveillance and executed numerous arrests across the northern coastal area of Matanzas Province.
The report, dated December 1963, details that the northern coastal area of Matanzas Province—particularly around Rio Palma—is under rigorous militia surveillance, with multiple arrests occurring in the towns of Marti, Itabo, and Maximo Gomez. Sourced from a network of local informants including unidentified fishermen and field operatives such as Humberto Bergara and Irene (Milian), the document underscores a coordinated effort by Cuban forces to tighten control along the coastline, while stressing the tentative nature of the intelligence and the need to protect its sub-sources.
