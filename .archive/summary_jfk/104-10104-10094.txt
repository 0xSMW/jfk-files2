Prosecuting the Masferrer group threatens to expose and undermine CIA Miami’s covert operations and alliances, potentially sparking damaging publicity and political fallout.  
The memorandum from 24 February 1967 outlines how the Justice Department’s decision to indict Rolando Masferrer and his associates could trigger extensive negative publicity that would compromise CIA Miami’s covert operations. It details the delicate balance maintained through favorable press relations and close cooperation with local institutions like the University of Miami, noting that emerging stories—such as those linking CIA activities to recruiting Cuban pilots for the Congo—could further expose sensitive operations. The document warns that even without direct involvement of CIA agents, defense strategies might leverage testimony from disaffected former agents or other insiders to drag the agency into the legal battle, thereby risking significant political fallout and eroding vital partnerships.
