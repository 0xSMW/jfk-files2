AMLEO-3’s independent, desperate attempt to rescue his family from Cuba, marked by conflicting accounts and operational inconsistencies, culminated in a failed exfiltration mission amid hostile engagement with Cuban forces.  
In this detailed dispatch, a chaotic and unsanctioned exfiltration operation led by AMLEO-3 is chronicled, revealing how the collapse of coordinated asylum efforts with KUBARK drove him to independently orchestrate a high-risk family rescue using the M/V ADA. The report outlines a series of operational missteps and shifting leadership—from Mario REMIS to Daniel Rodriguez Santos—along with poorly executed planning, miscommunications among team members, and a perilous landing attempt at Playa Guanabo that triggered hostile fire, ultimately resulting in a mission that not only failed to secure the family’s escape but also left key operatives injured and conflicting testimonies in its wake.
