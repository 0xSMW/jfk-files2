A wealthy anti-Castro Cuban details sabotage and funding plans while Mr. Pawley doubts revolutionary unity and U.S. support amid Castroâ€™s control.  
In a confidential October 1959 memo, Mr. William D. Pawley recounts a tape-recorded conversation in Miami with an unidentified Cuban from a wealthy anti-CASTRO group discussing plans to sabotage Cuba's sugar harvest. The discussion reveals that a representative of General Jose Eleutorio Pedraza, a key figure among revolutionary groups operating from the Dominican Republic, has been mobilizing efforts across Cuban provinces such as Camaguey, Santa Clara, Habana, and Matanzas. Pawley remains skeptical due to the disunity among anti-Castro factions, the dire economic situation in Cuba, and the risks associated with relying on U.S. moral support for such underground movements.
