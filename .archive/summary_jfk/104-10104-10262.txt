On December 20, 1967, a secret memorandum detailed intelligence received from London indicating that the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation had initiated contact with Jim Garrison, the District Attorney from Orleans, Louisiana, aiming to prompt him to write an article on President Kennedy’s assassination. The report, provided by MI-5 and passed to a London-based FBI representative, highlighted the sensitive nature of the source and the necessity for prior legal consultation before any further executive action.
