Intelligence records indicate that a planned shipment of gelatin explosives requested by the Communist Party of El Salvador was diverted to a funds transfer under Cuban direction after security exposures emerged, reflecting a strategic shift in clandestine arms operations.  
A translated report reveals that the Communist Party of El Salvador had requested twenty-five packages of gelatin explosives to be sent to Mexico for further delivery to El Salvador. During a March 1964 trip, a Cuban intelligence operative consulted with Manuel Pineiro and Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez, who confirmed that the explosives were already available at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, prompting a change in orders to send only money due to the exposure of a previous arms shipment to Venezuela. The report, which also includes detailed diplomatic travel records involving Esther Gavilán Rosales, underscores the complex coordination among Cuban intelligence, diplomatic channels, and covert arms logistics during the Cold War.
