The debriefing reveals that despite a disorganized opposition and Fidel Castro's acute sensitivity to defections, exploiting internal divisions—particularly the rift between Fidel and Raoul Castro—and leveraging influential contacts could offer significant operational advantages against the regime.
In this memorandum, Edward G. Tichborn provides a detailed account of his debriefing following his return from Cuba, highlighting that opposition groups are fragmented and unlikely to form a cohesive coalition. He notes that Fidel Castro's regime remains secure due to the leader's strong control and his adverse reaction to defections, which he amplifies publicly. Tichborn emphasizes the operational potential in exploiting the longstanding schism between Fidel and his brother Raoul, and he identifies several key figures—a Jesuit priest with early ties to Castro, a seasoned journalist, an academic peer, and a television producer—who may be influential in shaping propaganda and intelligence efforts.
