The document reveals that covert CIA operatives strategically used commercial partnerships in the Caribbean—through detailed meetings, covert security approvals, and credit negotiations—to facilitate intelligence gathering on Cuban activities while managing financial risks.

The article comprises a series of CIA internal memoranda from the mid-1960s that detail covert operational plans involving high-level officials such as Gale W. Allen and Edward Stanulis, and operatives like SKEWER/1. The documents outline a strategic initiative—codenamed under the umbrella of Project WUBRINY—to leverage commercial collaborations with entities like the Antilles Materials Company and the Puerto Rican Cement Company, aiming to embed intelligence assets within these firms to monitor Cuban activities in the Caribbean. Detailed discussions include arranging discreet meetings, using covert security approvals for individuals such as Luis Albert Ferre, and negotiating credit and commercial viability concerns, all of which underscore the integration of financial and operational intelligence to mitigate risks while pursuing broader geopolitical objectives in the region.
