Operational weaknesses, internal control lapses, and risky infiltration plans jeopardize Project AMTRUNK’s effectiveness, prompting recommendations for termination unless robust corrective measures are adopted.  
The operational review of Project AMTRUNK reveals a covert anti-Castro initiative fraught with significant challenges, including agents’ conflicting loyalties, overt anti-KUBARK sentiments, and potential internal betrayal that could undermine the mission. Detailed training regimens, infiltration/exfiltration schedules, and compartmentalized phase plans are outlined, yet serious security vulnerabilities persist—such as compromised safehousing, loose communications, and risky landing points near military assets—that amplify the risk of exposure if agents are captured. While the operation benefits from capable agents and promising contacts within Cuba, the report stresses that escalating control issues and competitive clandestine efforts further jeopardize the operation’s viability, leading to a recommendation for its termination unless decisive corrective actions are implemented.
