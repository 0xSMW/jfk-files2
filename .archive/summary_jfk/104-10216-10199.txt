The document outlines a clandestine communication protocol that directs agents to use coded messaging via the S/W system, with specific instructions on message sign-offs, multiple international addresses, and contingency procedures for resupply and emergency contact.  
The document, marked SECRET, establishes a clandestine network for coded communications among secret agents operating internationally. It begins with the identification of Rolando Cubela Secades, a radical post and separation agent at Fajardo Hospital in Havana, and specifies the use of a specialized S/W system with designated codes (#15136 carbon for sending and #56638 pills for receiving). Detailed addresses are provided for key contacts in Madrid, New York, and Paris, with instructions for routing messages via agents signing as "Ramon," "Pepe," or "Luis" to indicate message type and resupply. Additionally, it includes contingency measures, such as contacting Carlos Tepedino in New York if the primary system fails, and is co-signed by Wainwright, underscoring the documentâ€™s emphasis on secure, multi-layered communication logistics.
