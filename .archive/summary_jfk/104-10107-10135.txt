The memorandum reveals intricate covert operations and financial irregularities involving Thomas L. Roberts’ dual roles with the CIA and legal firms, raising suspicions about Herbert Itkin’s awareness and prompting further investigation into potential criminal activities.  
Dated 31 January 1969, the memorandum details a series of meetings initiated after a confrontation with the New York FBI office, focusing on the operational history and financial transactions of Thomas L. Roberts and Robert Delson. It chronicles Roberts’ longstanding involvement with the CIA—from covert assignments in West Africa and cover roles within legal firms to discrepancies in his financial compensations—and notes his interactions in international locations such as Geneva, Austria, and Dakar. The document also highlights Delson’s sporadic use in classified projects and ominous allegations regarding communist affiliations within his law firm. Repeated references by Herbert Itkin to Roberts’ CIA ties have sparked suspicions about his possible complicity, leading to a broader inquiry into internal security procedures and the potential for criminal prosecution over misappropriated funds and unauthorized operational activities.
