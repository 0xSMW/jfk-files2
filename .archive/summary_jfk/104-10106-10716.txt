The investigation exposed a complex Cold War network where SCHLUMBERGER’s corporate activities, international intelligence contacts, and disputed burglary allegations converged, implicating multiple actors and foreign interests.
The memorandum from December 1967 details allegations that a burglary at the Houma munitions bunker was “CIA-Inspired,” prompting charges against individuals such as Gordon Novel and Sergio Arcacha while clarifying that the CIA had no direct involvement. It underscores how Pierre Schlumberger and his affiliated companies, through acquisitions and classified contracts with entities like DAYSTRON, Inc. and Electro-Mechanical Research, Inc., became focal points of intelligence scrutiny. The document further reveals extensive investigations into key personnel across diverse locations including Houston, Paris, Moscow, and Connecticut, reflecting the intricate interplay of corporate operations and Cold War espionage.
