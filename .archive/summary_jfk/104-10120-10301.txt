Hidalgo, Balines N. Jr., C'Shen 03, FBI, State Department, CIA, security certification, informant integration, San Salvador  
The memorandum indicates that a security certification for former FBI informant Hidalgo, Balines N. Jr. for travel to San Salvador has been secured, although historical concerns by the State Department prompt a recommendation to verify with them before final approval.  
This U.S. government memorandum from December 2, 960 outlines the approval of a security certification for Hidalgo, Balines N. Jr., a subject with a background as a former FBI informant. Issued by (C'Shen) 03 and addressed to De/PSD, the memo confirms that the certification has been secured for an immediate travel order to San Salvador, effective for 30 days, while noting that the subjectâ€™s file, although non-derogatory, had previously led to hesitation by the State Department in 1957. The document raises the question of whether further consultation with the State Department is necessary before finalizing the certification.
