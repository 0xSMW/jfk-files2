The memo outlines the ongoing receipt and controlled dissemination of intelligence from CIA sources—originating from James Angleton’s liaison with Israeli Intelligence—detailing that U.S. citizens are traveling to Russia via Israel and necessitating reiterated field procedures.  
A classified memorandum from May 1962 details procedures for handling sensitive intelligence originally gathered under the Bureau Informant 100 designation, established in 1954. It explains that intelligence provided by James Angleton, through a liaison with the Israeli Intelligence Service and other controlled sources, has been regularly transmitted despite limited internal dissemination within the CIA. Authorized by Allen Dulles, the document reiterates field instructions on using specific symbols and characterizations, particularly in light of recent intelligence showing that U.S. citizens from various parts of the country are traveling to Russia via Israel. The memo underscores the importance of these measures and includes a distribution list of key personnel to ensure that the controlled release and declassification of this sensitive information are handled according to established protocols.
