An internal dispute arose over obtaining a police custody photo from an assassination scene due to conflicting protocols and the need for proper authorization.

In a document set against a strict 10 oâ€™clock DCI deadline, internal communications reveal a disagreement over procuring an image of individuals in police custody at an assassination scene. With Harry Dan Tuyl absent, Deputy Chief Lolis explained that the photo, lacking a proper credit line, could not be obtained directly from the wire service. Mr. Collis contacted Herb Simmons of CRS Document Services Group, who noted that although arrangements could be made via a New York contact, he could not process a domestic photo request without explicit authorization from Dr. Proctor Proctoe, and he advised against the request as it lacked a plausible justification for a state official.
