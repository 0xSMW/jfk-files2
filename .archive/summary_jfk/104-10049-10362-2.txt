The tape reveals fragmented anti-CASTRO groups planning sabotage amid economic decline and a lack of unified support, with U.S. officials deliberately remaining non-committal.
A tape-recorded conversation in Miami from October 1959 exposes plans by fragmented, wealthy anti-CASTRO factions to sabotage Cubaâ€™s upcoming sugar harvest. The dialogue, initiated by contacts from a representative of General Jose Eleutorio Pedraza, highlights critical challenges including insufficient financial backing, a lack of moral support, and significant internal disunity among revolutionary groups. Meanwhile, Mr. William D. Pawley underscores his reluctance to engage in such movements due to his U.S. government ties and concerns over potential Dominican involvement, emphasizing the dangerous implications of acting prematurely amid worsening economic conditions in Cuba.
