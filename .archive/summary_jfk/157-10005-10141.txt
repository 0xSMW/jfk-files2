Soviet Intelligence Career and Assassination Inquiry
Mr. Harvey, B, Patrice Lumumba, Fidel Castro, Soviet Intelligence Branch, Foreign Service, Assassination plots, Berlin, Washington, Rome
Despite a distinguished career across Berlin, Washington, and Rome, Mr. Harvey maintained that he had no personal knowledge of any assassination plots against foreign leaders.
The transcript records an interview in which Mr. Harvey outlines his career with the Soviet Intelligence Branch, detailing his assignments as Station Chief in Berlin from 1952 to 1959, in Washington until 1963 with intermittent temporary duties abroad, and in Rome from 1963 to 1966 before returning to Washington and retiring in 1967. It also notes his concurrent involvement with the Foreign Service of State during these periods, a fact that raised questions of propriety. When asked about any potential assassination plans or plots within the Agency—specifically those involving Patrice Lumumba or other foreign leaders—Mr. Harvey categorically stated that he had no personal knowledge of such operations.
