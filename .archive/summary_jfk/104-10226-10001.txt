The memorandum reveals that U.S. intelligence, in consultation with the FBI and Ambassador Thompson, intends to proceed with hostile interrogation of NOSENKO—regarded as a provocateur—while preparing contingencies to mitigate escape risks, defection issues, and potential Soviet exploitation.
On January 21, 1965, U.S. intelligence officials led by the DDP and the Chief of the SR Division briefed Ambassador Thompson on their plan to conduct hostile interrogation of NOSENKO, whom they had determined to be a provocateur. Detailed discussions with FBI representatives, including Deputy Director William C. Sullivan and confirmation from John Edgar Hoover, underscored both convergences and differences in case interpretation, prompting careful contingency planning. The memorandum addresses security measures such as confining NOSENKO to a guarded country house, preempting escape or suicide, and evaluating his capacity to discredit American officials, while also noting the implications for Soviet propaganda and defection rates. Additionally, the document mentions the parallel AEJOYFUL case under British control, highlighting the broader intelligence dynamics at play.
