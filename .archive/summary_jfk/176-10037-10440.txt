The telegram reveals that both Communist China and Cuba offered material support to Governor Leonel Brizola during Brazil's political crisis, a move declined to avoid triggering US intervention.
This document, part of the Richard Goodwin Papers from NARA, details a 1961 CIA telegram reporting that during the week of August 27, leaders Mao Tse Tung and Fidel Castro extended offers of supplies and personnel to Leonel Brizola, then Governor of Rio Grande do Sul, to back Vice President Joao Goulart’s succession following President Janio Quadros’ resignation. Brizola appreciated the moral support but rejected the tangible assistance to prevent escalating Brazil’s domestic political crisis into an international incident that could invite US intervention. The report, compiled in Rio de Janeiro and disseminated to key US agencies, underscores Cold War tensions and the complex interplay of international communist outreach and national political strategy.
