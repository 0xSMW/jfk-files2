1965 Diplomatic Meeting on Secretarial Staffing
Subject, Sidney P. Di Ubaldo, AMWHIP-1, AMBUNNY, Al Marin, UNSNAFU-19, diplomatic staffing, candidate screening, operational strain, National Airport, Washington, New York
The memorandum highlights operational challenges in securing a reliable candidate for a sensitive diplomatic secretarial role, underscored by Subject’s evasiveness and personal strain, necessitating decisive follow-up actions.
On 21 May 1965 at National Airport, a meeting was held to address the appointment of a multilingual secretary for a Paris mission following an earlier informal discussion with UNSNAFU-19. A phone call on 20 May prompted Subject to travel to Washington to further explore the issue, with the expectation that his recommendation would secure a candidate despite previous non-committal talks. The report details AMBUNNY’s qualifications—including her U.S. education, experience with the American Ambassador in La Paz, and the potential risk of her background being exposed to Cuban scrutiny—and notes a follow-up meeting in New York with Al Marin to clarify these concerns. Observations of Subject’s accelerated aging and reluctance to confront issues highlight the operational strain and the need for a more decisive approach.
