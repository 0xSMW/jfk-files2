Secret dispatch on KGB operative lead
Weyde, Dr. Ne ter, Aeladle, Lester S. Redniles, KGB operative, Soviet intelligence, West Germany, trade mission building
Intelligence officers discussed a potential KGB operative in West Germany based on a lead from Aeladle, warranting further inquiry to confirm his identity.
On June 4, 1963, a classified dispatch detailed a meeting in which intelligence officers, including Weyde and Dr. Ne ter, recounted a conversation with Aeladle during a car ride where he casually mentioned a KGB officer currently assigned in Germany. Although the operative’s name—beginning with an "A" and possibly identified as Akhluyev—was not fully recalled, the document noted his political alignment and residence within a trade mission building. The dispatch, signed by Lester S. Redniles, underscores the limited yet potentially significant nature of the lead, recommending further inquiry with Aeladle to clarify the operative's identity.
