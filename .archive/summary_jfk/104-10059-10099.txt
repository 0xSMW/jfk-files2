Robert West Pugh, Bart Pugh, Covert Security Approval, Excessive Drinking, FBI Investigation, Resignation, Far East, Taipei, Los Angeles, Santa Rosa  
Despite initial covert approval for deployment in the Far East, investigations into Robert West Pugh's excessive drinking and his brother's controversial history prompted security concerns and ultimately led to his resignation.  
The document comprises multiple classified memoranda dating from 1966 to 1968 regarding covert security approvals for Robert West Pugh's assignment as a First Officer in the Far East under Project HBILKA/JBGREED. The records detail a favorable security review aside from significant concerns about his past, including a documented issue of excessive drinking that compromised his military performance and judgment. They also reveal an FBI investigation into his brother, Bart Pugh, for alleged Communist affiliations, though no direct link to Robert West Pugh was established. Subsequent actions include a formal resignation in Taipei, sensitive dissemination controls, and administrative cancellation requests, reflecting the stringent security protocols of the Cold War era.
