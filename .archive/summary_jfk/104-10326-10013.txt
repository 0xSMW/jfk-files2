The memo details ARRB's renewed efforts to secure BKGB documents related to Lee Harvey Oswald and the JFK assassination, highlighting past meeting failures, legal privacy constraints, and diplomatic challenges.

In this classified memorandum from March 1998, US government personnel, including the ARRB and diplomatic officers, are briefed on renewing efforts to access BKGB records in Minsk that pertain to Lee Harvey Oswald and the JFK assassination. The document recounts previous unsuccessful meetings in October 1996 where BKGB officials, citing privacy laws and legal complications, refused to release sensitive documentsâ€”particularly those concerning living Belarusians such as Oswald's former wife, Marina. It also notes the controversial involvement of Norman Mailer, whose profitable publication on the subject led BKGB to feel exploited, and concludes with instructions for further diplomatic facilitation and legal guidance to overcome these challenges.
