The briefing emphasized stringent intelligence compartmentation, cross-agency cooperation, and a forceful stance against Cuban and Mexican influences to counter insurgency threats.
On 9 October 1964, a confidential intelligence briefing was held in a luxurious government conference room in Guatemala, attended by key Guatemalan officials including Chief of State Colonel Peralta, Colonel Serrano, and Colonel Porres, as well as two CIA officers. Initiated by a Senior CIA Officer, the session detailed operational security protocols, the structure and aims of Guatemala’s DGI, and specific intelligence requirements—such as the Salvadoran "Caso Zapato" file and the case of a detained Mexican courier working for Cuban intelligence. The briefing also covered plans for potentially transferring Dalton from El Salvador to Guatemala, reflecting broader discussions on coordinated actions within the OAS framework. In his impassioned remarks, Peralta criticized past U.S. inaction against Castro, called for a hardline approach including the use of force, and condemned Mexico for its perceived leniency, thereby underlining the strategic imperative for decisive countermeasures against communist influences in the region.
