MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT: Debriefing of Edward G. Tichbern(P)

1. Edward G.Tichborn(P) arrived in Washington from his trip to Cuba during
the night of 31 January 1960/. He was debraefed at the Hotel Statler from about
1000 to 1530 hours on 1 February. Those present at the debriefing were Messrs.
Phil Toomey and Charles Penney from WH Division, Mr Alexander Hunter) PP/EAD, and
the Undersigned. This debriefing was very interesting and resulted in a good
deal of pertinent information. The three and a half reels of tape derived fxKE
therefrom are now being transcribed by this office. Some of the more salient
points are noted below.

2. Some of the operational information and suggestions offered by Tichborn
are the following:

a. There appears to be little chance of a coalition of the opposition
groups at this time or in the near future since they are not well organized
and each group would want to be the leader of such an effort. Also,
according to the members of the opposition to whom Tichborn talked, it is
the general consensus of opinion that Fidel Castro is in no danger of loosing
his grip or the devotion of his followersx for some time to come.

b. Fidel Castro seems to become most upset and almost paniced by
defections. Possessing a "Messiah-type complex he cannot bear the thought
of someone leaving the fold. Rather than to let such defections pass on
unnoticed, he feels compelled to give reasons and rake excuses. This then
blows the matter up perhaps out of proportion and quickly becomes a matter
of public knowledge. Tichborn feels that the inducement of defactions could
perhaps have more effect on Castro than any other single, rational action we
might undertake.

c. There appears to be a relatively long-standing schism between the
brothers Fidel and haoul Castro. Raoul is the mone cold individual. As an
example, Fidel once ordered some 400 prisoners to be returned safely to their
homes, but Racul had a number of them killed. The general feeling in Cuba is
that Fidel is not a Communist, but that Raoul is undoubtedly at least a
fellow-traveller. Developing or exploiting this schism could therefore, be
operationally advantageous. (The fact that they are brothers would probably
have little effect on Fidel who has already reduced kixxxak the land holdings
of his mother and another brother in conformity with the agrarian refora
program and who failed his sister, and fired a Minister, over a shake-down
on an insurance deal.)

3. Of special operatioral interest ware several individuals Tichborn
mentioned who might have some influence on Fidel Castro and hence might be of

operational interest. They are:

a. Pather (Padre) Alberto de Castros he is a Jesuit priest presently
located in Caracas, Venezuela, who had been a teacher of Fidel Castro during
his youth. Castro was in Venezuela and saw Father de Castro there during
which time the latter criticized Fidel for some of his actions. In spite of
the fact that this remonstration occured in front of some of Fidel's men,
and they laterthe latter treated him with great respect. It was felt by Tichbern's source
chatted alone of this information, and by Tichborn, that Father de Castro undoubted
has some influence over Castro. Tichborn suggested that it would be of value to
determine whether or not Fidel has any regular contact with Father de Castro
and if so, what operational potential he might have.

b. Herb Mathewss he is a journalist with the F.V.Times and was the only
American newspaperman covering the Castro story prior to his final success.
While Tichborn was in Vuba, a front page article sa appeared in Revolucion
(the regime's press-spokesman) on Mathews. It was a sort of editorial and
praised Mathews as a "real man" and one who understood the revolution and
its aims. Tichborn feels that it might be to our advantage to get into
contact with Mathews since he appears to have the confidence of the
administration.

c. Professor Rosco: Subject is on the faculty of the Universidad de
Villanueva and is a contemporary of Fidel Castro. They were classmates and
both were debators although according to Rosco, Castro did not make the
Debating Society of which he (Rosco) was the presidentOnce after the
revolution, Rosco attended a sppech Castro made and after the oration, the
latter asked Rosco what he thought of it. Upon hearing some criticism, he wanted
to know how it could have been improved. Since Castro was leaving for
Venezuela and the United States he asked Rosco to accompany him in order that
they could discuss the matter further. Tichborn feels that Rosco (a member of
the opposition) Max probably has more influence on Castro than Rosco realizes
and that this possibility would be worth looking into.

d. Edward R.Murrow: he produced a TV program on Castro and Tichborn feels
that he might have established a rapport with Castro during this period.

4. One of the contacts Tichborn made in Cuba (the Director of Tourism) asked
him if he knew of anyone who would be interested in coming to Cuba on an all-expenses-
paid visit in order to write articles (or other similar propaganda) on present day
Cuba. Tichborn mentioned Clete Roberts, a popular radio and TV commentator in ios
Angeles as a possible candidate. (Tichborn also discussed this matter with Horace
W. Davis.) Tichborn will mention this possibility to Roberts upon his return to
Californic.

5. While in Cuba, Tichborn accidently met a young lady who later revealed to
him that she was "an agent for the State Department". He felt that this was a
security matter and that it should be brought to our attention for that purpose.
Mr Toomey did not recognize the name; it is being further checked cut with WH
Division. The incident and the details will be made the subject of a separate
memorandum for CI Staff.

6. On the administrative side, Tichherr will forward by mail his
financial accounting, one copy to the cover company and the other to Henry
W. Darkin(P). The cover letter which was provided him the the event that
he came to the attention of the Cuban authorities was returned to us and is
now in his file. (There was no necessity for its use.) Tichborn inquired as to
the possibility of receiving reimbursement for medical exponses which will
undoubtedly be incurred upon his return to California due to a possible hernia
which developed in New York on his return trip en route to Washington. This is
being checked out by this office. Tichborn departed for Los Angeles (having been
taken to Freindship International Airport by Donry Derkin) at about 1800
hours on 1 February 1960.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Luis Clements POSADA-Carriles
REFERENCES: a. Memo for Record, 26 June 1967, by LRH,
same subject
b. Williamson/Henze Telephone Conversation,
28 June 1967
1. In my meeting with the Department of Justice today, I
confirmed that POSADA-Carriles was our man. I outlined the pre-
liminary information we had developed on the transactions between
him and one Lefty Rosenthal.
2. Justice was advised that our information disclosed that
POSADA-Carriles had passed silencers and grenades, to Rosenthal
during July 1965, and that in October 1966 he had furnished pencils
and fuses. I also stated that it was our understanding that POSADA-
Carriles was in contact with FDI/Miami and that it had been advised
of these dealings. Justice was told that the items involved were not
of Agency origin. It was emphasized, however, that this was our
preliminary conclusion and that we would undertake to verify it.
3. Justice acknowledged that FBI reporting disclosed
POSADA-Carriles as its contact but apparently the details are some-
what vague. To make a federal case against Rosenthal because of his
suspected involvement in the bombings, it will be necessary to show
that the items used were obtained through interstate commerce. A
preliminary reading suggests prosecution under Title 18 Section 837.
Out of concern for the allegation of entrapment, Justice asked that
hint el ser
yot the sound.

we supply answers to the following: (a) did POSADA-Carriles
volunteer himself to the FBI or did it approach him initially;
(b) who informed the FBI of the July 1965 deal - the Agency or
POSADA-Carriles; (c) on what date was this information given;
(d) similarly as regards the October 1966 transaction, the date
the information farnished and by whom; (e) what were POSADA-
Carriles sources for the items or their components; (f) were
these sources within or without the State of Florida? And inci-
dentally were we aware that supposedly POSADA-Carriles realized
a "profit" for furnishing the October 1966 items and that he tried
without success to turn it into the "company"? While I agreed to
undertake to obtain the information requested, I suggested that
much of it might be readily available from the FBI. Justice con-
coded this and intenda to have further discussions with it.
4. Daring the course of the meeting the interesting
hypothesis was suggested to the effect that POSADA-Carriles
might have been "moonlighting" for Rosenthal, and only when he
began to feel the pressure did he start reporting to the Agency and
the FBI.
5. Under strictly controlled conditions with POSADA-
Carriles acting as a conduit, Justice is considering the possibility
of assisting Rosenthal to obtain his needed items, whereupon he
will be arrested immediately for possession. I told them while we
might be willing to have POSADA-Carriles so used we were under-
standably concerned over the adverse comment that our employee's
involvement could generate.
4. On a matter that may be related: one Albert LARRAIN
Maestre is alleged to have admitted to POSADA-Carriles that he has
been involved in the bombings with Rosenthal and to have said more
explosives were needed. LARRAIN Maestre is a fugitive under a
narcotics endictment having formerly resided at 153 East 57th Street,
New York, New York. Do we have any information on this person?
