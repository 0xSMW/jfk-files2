THE LEE HARVEY OSWALD CASE #851164

29 January 1964

1. According to a newspaper column of "Allen and Scott" in the Chicago American of 6 December 1963, on the OSWALD Case, Abram CHAYES, Legal Officer of the State Department, was one of two persons immediately responsible for OSWALD's being permitted to return to the United States from the Soviet Union in June 1962. The other individual named was Llewellyn THOMPSON, the then Ambassador to Russia. Another said to have been involved in the handling of OSWALD's case was Samuel WISE, Counsel of the American Embassy in Moscow.

2. Abram CHAYES, 852234, who as of 16 February 1961 was described as "the new Counsel in State", was granted Security approval for liaison contact with J. Foster COLLINS (in the office of the Chief of the Covert Action Staff) on 6 March 1961. The request for CHAYES' clearance was a "Blanket" request to permit discussion with him of HSC 5412/2 matters on a need-to-know basis.

3. In September 1961 there was a White House namecheck request on CHAYES' wife Antonia (Toni) Leigh CHAYES, aka: HANDLER.

4. In March 1962, CHAYES was granted a renewal of his liaison contact clearance with C/CI on a continuing basis. This time his contact was Archibald ROOSEVELT, Jr.

5. On 10 February 1962, HUMAN EVENTS reported as follows with reference to CHAYES:

   "SOFT ON COMMUNISM: Representative Francis E. Walter (R.-Pa.), Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, has scared the new State Department regulations on passports, claiming they would allow Reds denied passports to "rifle freely the confidential files of the FBI, the CIA and other investigative agencies." The man behind the new regulations, which Walter claims violate the Internal Security Act of 1950, is reportedly State's chief legal officer, Abram Chayes. Chayes, a Kennedy appointee, is an ex-Harvard professor who was Chester Bowles' top legal adviser when Bowles was Governor of Connecticut. Walter has introduced legislation to remedy the new passport regulations."

6. Samuel WISE, "Counsel in the American Embassy in Moscow" who is referred to above, may well be Samuel Griffin WISE JR., #974574, GD & SSD, who apparently was once a contract employee on ABRAXINE. The State Department reviewed WISE's file on 2 June 1954; and as of September 1962 a Samuel G. WISE was Second Secretary of the American Embassy in Moscow. At that time WISE advised in a cable to the State Department that it appeared that Bruce Frederick DAVIS, #352267, who defected from the United States Army in Germany on 18 August 1960, had not expatriated himself. DAVIS' case is very similar to that of OSWALD; and he, like OSWALD, lived in the Soviet Union for two years after his defection and prior to making application for return to the United States.

7. WISE was an applicant for CIA employment in early 1953 and was security approved subject to polygraph on 12 August 1953. He did not enter on duty and in September 1953 the office "which had been interested in him was no longer interested". On 13 November 1953, WISE was granted a CHA to permit his use as a contract employee on ABRAXINE in New York City. His CHA was cancelled on 24 March 1958.

8. WISE was named as a friend of William Orville MUNSELL, #61693-DL, during an investigation of the latter for possible CIA employment in 1952. WISE, according to MUNSELL's landlady and social acquaintance in Washington, D.C. during the period of about a year which ended in April 1952, was the only person she knew by name with whom MUNSELL was friendly. According to the informant, WISE was a student at Columbia University whose address was 423 Furnald Hall. MUNSELL was Security disapproved for CIA employment in June 1952 because of his close association on a professional and social basis, while attending Denver University from 1946 to 1951, with persons of questionable loyalty. In November 1954, MUNSELL was of interest to project FJIIVE with reference to assignment to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; however, the interested office withdrew their request and later Security advised of the derogatory information regarding him.

9. WISE from 1951 to 1954 attended Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, New York, which was attacked by a Citizens Group, which alleged Communist influence in the school system. He had several questionable associates in addition to MUNSELL.

SECRET
ReBulet 11/19/64. 62-27799-507

Files of Legat, Bern, have been reviewed for
individuals residing in Switzerland and Austria considered
to be a possible threat to the President, and no one was
found to fit this category.

In addition, discreet inquiry was made of the
following sources, all of whom had no knowledge of individuals
who might be considered threats:

Consular Section, the Embassy, Bern;
Office of Special Assistant (covert CIA);
_ the Embassy, Bern;
American Consulate General, Vienna;
Research Branch (covert CIA) the Embassy,
Vienna;
Security Officer, the Embassy, Vienna.

In this regard, however, Bureau attention is called
to the case entitled PAUL GEORGE ANDERSON, aka, IS-X (Buff
100-415051)。 ANDERSON has been reported to be of interest
to the Secret Service (Legat, Paris, letter dated 10/16/64)。
While he does not reside in territory covered by this office,
he is in rather frequent transit en route to Hungary, where
he is attempting to obtain a visa for his Hungarian wife to
enter the U.S.

In 1954, a procedure was approved whereby we could attri-
bute certain information received from James Angleton, CIA, under
the symbol "Bureau Informant 100." This information, for the most
part, emanated from a Liaison arrangement which CIA maintained with
the Israeli Intelligence Service and from other sources under the
control of Angleton. Much of the information developed by Angleton
was not disseminated within CIA but he felt that the data should be
passed on to the Bureau. Allen Dulles gave him authorization to
handle dissemination in this matter. We continue to receive informa-
tion of value on a regular basis.

By SAC Letter 54-27 dated 5/25/54, we informed the field
regarding Bureau Informant 100 and issued instructions that informa-
tion from this source be described under an appropriate T symbol and
characterization. Because of the passage of time and since some
offices have had rare occasion to receive Bureau Informant 100 infor-
mation, it is believed desirable to reiterate instructions to the
field. This should be done since the Informant has been developing
information in recent months regarding the travel of U. S. citizens
to Russia via Israel. Such travelers come from various parts of the
U. S.

Director
Central Intelligence Agency

NOTE:

Subject is a commercial representative from Yugoslavia. Information was received from CIA that an individual with the same last name was a member of Yugoslav Intelligence Service (YIS). However, another source of CIA advised subject was not a member of YIS. CIA has learned that an individual believed to be the subject is being recalled to Yugoslavia, but this individual wishes to remain in the U. S. CIA desires verification of this information because if it is true CIA may wish to consider contacting subject in an effort to persuade him to return to Yugoslavia under control of CIA. Subject is supposed to return to Yugoslavia at end of April, 1963. Approach to subject by FBI is not recommended because New York informants said in March, 1963, subject is not engaged in intelligence activities and because State recently denied clearance for approach in similar case.

B: Sure -- go ahead.

H: Make that Soviet Intelligence Branch.

on December 31. Now, Mr. Harvey, does that summarize basically
part of your background, at least that we discussed?

H: That is correct. I would like to add one thing, if I
may. During both the Berlin and Rome periods and for a considerable
period of time in Washington after I returned from Berlin I
was on the roles of the Foreign Service of State, which raises
a little question of propriety. But I want you to know that
in the handling of this.

B: All right. I first asked you with regard to any
knowledge of any assassination plans or plots within
the Agency concerning Patrice Lumumba and you might indicate
what your response was to that, Mr. Harvey.

H: I have no personal knowledge of any such plan or
operation within or on the part of the Agency.

B: I also asked you apart from the question of Fidel
Castro whether or not you had any knowledge of
any assassination plans or plots in the Agency that involved
any other foreign leader.
