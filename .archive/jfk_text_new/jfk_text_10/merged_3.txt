SUBJECT: SCHLUMBERGER WELL SURVEYING CORPORATION
(See Houma Munitions Dunker - Lease" by Subject firm)

ALLEGATION:

GARRISON has charged
that the burglary of the
Houme munitions bunker was
"CIA-Inspirei." He issued
arrest warrants for Gordon
NOVEL and-Sergio ARCACHA
SITE charging them with
the Houma burglary.

SOURCE:

Enclosure 24 of
CI/R&A remorandum of
7 August 1967.

CIA CONNECTION:

CIA had no connection with the
alleged burglery of the Houma Munitions
Bunker or any connection with the
bunker itself.
However, Pierre SCHLUMBERGER, prezident
of the SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION, was of
contact interest in 1950 for routine
exploitation as a foreign intelligence
source. The FBI advised they had no objection
to the Agency's interrogating Pierre
SCHLUMBERGER who was an alien. In 1962
DAYSTRON, INC. was acquired by SCHLUMBERGER,
INC. The Agency had a contract with DAY-
STRON for an unclassified item ($49,000
contract for the production of Mark II
limmet mines); Agency interest was classified
Secret. SCHLUMBERGER, LTD. is a Dutch firm
controlled by French nationais. After the
Kerger, it was determined that future relation-
ship with DAYSTRON must be governed by
Agency policy not to place classified contracts
with & foreign firm. In 1963 the same
decision was reaches concerning Agency con-
tracts with Electro-Fechanical Research, Inc.,
*a subsidiary of SCHLUMBERGER, LTD. ENR
dealt in all phases of telemetry. Contact
clearances for other personnel of SCHLUMBERGER
are set out below.

OS INDICES RESULTS:

The SCHLUMBERGER COMPANY was the subject of a nare check in
1947 bec use of a contact request, and it was determine) that there are
mrber of SCHLU PERCER corporations in Latin America which are domi-
nated by French nation:18. SCHLUBERGER has a patented operation for an
oil vell shooting" service which is subscribei to by various oil companies.
The SCHLUMBERGER WELL SURVEYING CORPORATION in Fouston was controlled by
Henri Ceorges DOLL, & French national. Be was of contact interest in
1956 and 1957. Eis wife is the daughter of Conrad SCHLUMBERGER.

In August 1951 the Agency was interested in contacting Professor
Edouard POLDINI, a geophysicist and professor at the University of
Geneva and formerly an employee of the SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION in
Paris, for operational use. He was to be used as a channel to a Janus
KANTAS who could give information about the fate of the previous employees of
the Jersey Company in Hungary, the production figures and extent of
exploitation of existing oil fields and exploration of new oil fields
together with the names of the officials of the Russian Hungarian Company
who took over the Jersey Company.

In March 1953 the SCHLUMBERGER file reflects that an FBI source
furnished information that one Maurice Henri MARTIN, employed as an
engineer by the SCHLUMBERGER Company, Paris, France, received a letter
dated 27 July 1951 at Moscow from one Biegfried Stefanovitch MOROSOFF,
asking MARTIN for specialized information concerning geophysics. The
letter requested that MARTIN's reply be forwarded to Moscow through an inter-
mediary. From January 1932 until April 1937 MARTIN represented the SCHLUMBERGER
Company in Russia as an engineer, and it was thought that the correspondence
from MOROSOFF may represent a Soviet attempt to resume contact with MARTIN
and develop clandestine relations with him. The FBI conducted an investi-
gation dated June 1953 and determined that Maurice Henri MARTIN resided
at Nod Hill, Wilton, Connecticut and was employed by the SCHLUMBERGER
Well Surveying Co., Ridgefield, Connecticut. Informants advised that
although MARTIN was strongly nationalistic toward France, he gave every
indication of being anti-Russian and there was no evidence of CP activities.

When DAYSTROM, INC. merged with SCHLUMBERGER, LTD., research was
done on the directors and officers of SCHLUMBERGER, LTD. The results
are as follows:

OS indices reflect a record on Dillon ANDERSON, a trustee of
Electro-Mechanical Research, Inc. (a subsidiary of SCHLUMBERGER, LTD.)
who was also a proposed trustee of "NEW DAYSTROM" when it merged with
SCHLUMBERGER. ANDERSON is an attorney from Houston, Texas who was
appointed by President EISENHOWER as an advisor to the National Security
Council from 1953 until 1956. He was considered for a special clearance
in August 1955 but the briefing was not given. He was granted a covert O
clearance in December 1953 and April 1954 for use as a covert associate
on Project LPFUNNEL. J

Pierre SCHLUMBERGER, President and Chief Executive Officer,
SCHLUMBERGER, LTD., Houston, Texas, French citizen, was of contact
interest in 1950.

Charles C. PARLIN, Director of SCHLUMBERGER, LTD., and a member
of the law firm of SHEARMEN, STERLING and WRIGHT, Englewood, New
Jersey, U. S. citizen, was of contact interest in 1962 but was
security disapproved. PARLIN was allegedly the boy friend of Johanna
BEKER who was in contact with known Soviet Agents, ROBERT and JACK
SOBLE. BEKER advised the FBI in 1957 that she received, paid for and
transmitted to Robert SOBLE, OSS information which was given her by
two former OSS employees. She also advised the FBI in 1957 that she

had given a very general outline of her activities to PARLIN ani
it is reliably reported that PARLIN and EMER shared a hotel roon
in Folland in 1957. PARLIN recorrented & Willion bart LANCASTER
for OSS employrent. LANCASTER was a member of the care law firm as
PARLIN and had a long record of Cortunist, front affiliations. PARLIN
in 1956 traveled to Jussia as a member of & delegation under the
sponsorship of the National Council of Churches. De was also the
lawyer for & Swiss & zament industrialist who sola erms to the
Nazis and the Communist countries since that time.

Clark Drouillard GOODMAN, Vice-President of SCHLU-BERGER,
Ltd., Houston, Texas, U. S. citizen, was security disapproved for
use by TED in 1952 and for contact use in 1955 based on his support
of Frofessor Dirk STRUIK, & colleague at FTT, who was indicted on
chere of having been a Communist conspirstor and identified as a
Cormaist Party member. In Farch 1959 the same derogatory information
wis furnished the Contact Office to be considered in determining any
use of GOOD AN. Also, a book written by GOODHAN's wife, Kay Ellen
GOOD AN, was favorably reviewed by the 'DAILY WONER" in 1956.

Jean C. LEGRAND, Vice-President of the SCHLUBERGER WELL
SURVEYING CORPORATION, Pigefield, Connecticut (U. S. citizen,
naturalised Fouston, Texas 1941) was approved for contact use in Kay
1957. Ele file is clear. There is a notation that one Hrs. J. C.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Herbert Itkin

RETURN TO CIA
Background Use Only
Do Not Reproduce

1. A meeting was held on 27 January 1969 with Messrs.
Rocca, Houston, Warner and myself to discuss the ramifications
of the confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January.
It was concluded that additional information was required on
(Thomas L. Roberts) and (Robert Delson). I contacted the Director
of Security and requested the security files on these two individuals
and was advised that we could not have the security files but that
Mr. Ward Greene would bring the files to the office and discuss
their contents openly.

2. On 29 January, Mr. Greene brought the security files
on (Roberts) and (Delson) and was most cooperative in explaining
their contents. Attached is a chronological rundown on the
pertinent information on Thomas L. Roberts' affiliation with
the FBI, CIA and Itkin.

3. On 30 January a meeting was held with Messrs. Houston,
Warner, Rocca, and (Eugene Milligan), to discuss
the operational use of Mr. Roberts. Mr. Roberts has been a
Staff Agent of CIA since 28 August 1961. From March 1964 to
November 1964 he spent time in West Africa) writing a monograph
on (West African legal) problems. It should be noted that this
task was performed under a grant from a foundation which was
blown in the MHDOWEL exposures. In November 1964 (Roberts)
was assigned for Cover to the (Radio Corporation of America
legal) staff where he remained until March 1965 and then went
to (Dakar.

4. The facts in the attached chronology are subject to
question since they are the result of (Roberts)' own explanation of
his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from
independent sources. The most critical aspect would appear to
be the knowledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of
(Roberts)' affiliation with CIA. This knowledge is borne out by
the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly brings (Roberts)' name
into the story which Itkin develops about his CIA affiliations.
One of the questions to be answered by CP GLOBE personnel is
whether or not (Roberts) reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva,
Switzerland, in March 1966. There appears to be no record of
(Roberts)' having explained why he never pursued the Itkin debt or
what his financial contribution was to the law firm of Itkin, Roberts&
and Greenbaum.)

5. Mr. Rocca was advised by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI
that the New York District Attorney may be considering prosecution
against (Robert for having absconded with funds received from
negligence cases. We do not have sufficient information to evaluate
the likelihood of criminal prosecution. It may be necessary to
discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office.

6. With regard to (Robert Delson) there appear to have been
two operational considerations, one having been a request to use
him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February
1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations
Division for his use on Project WUBRINY. In March 1964 DO
Division advised Security that (Delson) was not going to be used
on WUBRINY. Mr. Rocca commented that there are some rather
ominous allegations against members of the firm of (Delson, Levin
and Gordon, indicating that one member of the firm was a card-
carrying member of the Communist Party. At the present time
Mr. Rocca is investigating the DTPILLAR use of Mr. (Delson)

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM : Chief, SB/2 Desk

SUBJECT: COVER, NONOFFICIAL) - GENERAL
(Proposal for A&E Assessment of Potential
REDSKIN Agent Candidates)
#90682

1. Reference is made to my previous memorandum pertaining
to the subject as captioned, ending with the Memorandum for the
Record dated 21 February 1961.

2. As indicated in the referenced memorandum, CCG feels
that the PSYCHOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT ASSOCIATES) (see copy of SR
memorandum-dated 3 February 1961 and my memorandum dated 21
February 1961) should not be utilized. This decisionvas made
as a result of a conversation between Mr. Howard OSBORNE,
Deputy Chief, SR Division, and Mr. Jack SOUTHARD, Chief, CCG/NC.

3. A meeting was called on 27 February 1961 to determine
the type of cover organization that should be substituted for
this purpose. After considering the matter at length, it was
ascertained that the Agency has a cleared (employment) service in
Pittsburgh which could possibly be utilized as an initial
A&E assessment. This firm, the EMPLOYMENT SERVICE COMPANY
is located in the Union Trust Building, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,)
and is managed by Margaret A. KEARNEY) (see SSD File 95018).
It was agreed that if the EMPLOYERS SERVICE COMPANY could
provide the needed cover, two OTR psychologists would be docu-
mented in true name with that firm in Pittsburghio CCG (Frank
O'MALLEY) will make a trip to Pittsburgh in the next few days
to determine whether Miss (KEARNEY) is amenable to the proposed
arrangement. The two psychologists selected were Doctors
BRADT and McKEF) on whom credit checks were recently completed
th negative results as to Agency employment.

4. It was further ascertained at this time that Mr.
Howard OSBORE desired that all training and assessment of
REDSKIN Agents who pass the initial screening be conducted

outside the Washington, D. C. area. lHost of the training will
be conducted in an SR safe house in New York. The SR represen-
tative will probably request a safe house in Baltimore for the
final assessment and processing of those REDSKIN Agents that
are cleared in the initial screening by either BRADT or (MCKEE) 06
It should be noted at this point that SR Division plans to
process thirty or thirty-five REDSKIN Agents this year. Time
is, of course, of the essence, in view of the fact that these
people will have to be assessed, security-cleared, briefed,
and trained, and arrangements for grants made before the summer
season.
