26 January 1965
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Antilles Material Company Limited (AMCO) -
Meeting with SKEWER/1 on the Relationship
of the Puerto Rican Cement Company to AMCO
2, λε agreed in his il January 1965 meeting with
SKEWER/1, Hr. Edward Stanulis telephoned SKEWER/1 on the
morning of 18 January to arrange a meeting with SKEWER/1
at his convenience later in the day. SKEWER/1 suggested
a meeting at 1500 hours that afternoon in his office at
the Puerto Rican Iron Works in Fonce. He indicated to
Mr. Stanulis that the Puerto Rican Cement Company looks
with favor on AMCO and is doing business with it through
its Manager, Mr. Alvin T. Philpotts, Jr.
2. Prior to the meeting, Messrs. Allen, Carter, and
Stanulis reviewed the approach to be made to SKEWER/1 in
the light of his favorable view of AMCO. It was agreed
that no mention would be made of the fact that AMCO is in
poor financial condition or that Mr. Philpotte is inade-
quate as a manager. Stress would be laid upon assessment
of the long-term commercial viability of AMCO because
KUBARK is ostensibly interested in placing an officer in
a managerial position in AMCO, or some other similar firm,
in order to monitor Castro's activities in the Caribbean
area.
3. Messrs. Allen, Carter, and Stanults arrived pre-
cisely at 1500 hours at SKEWER's office on the second floor
of the Puerto Rican Iron Works. His male secretary asked
us to take seats in the corridor outside his office.
Within a few minutes his "sacretary reappeared and asked us
to wait in the Conference Room. Some ten minutes later
SKEWER/1 appeared and invited us into his private office.
He war extremely cordial and gracious. Mr. Stanulis intro-
duced Mr. Allen as a colleague who is assessing AMCO's com-
mercial viability. He introduced Mr. Carter as a lawyer
consultant who is obtaining background information in the
event KUBARK should decide to proceed with placement of an
officer in AMCO.

4. Mr. Allen informed SKEWER/1 that SUBARK is assessing
the factors bearing on the long-term commercial viability
of AMCO. Se explained that K:MARK does not want to place an officer in a
company which is not commercially viable for the long
term. One of the factors bearing on the commercial via-
bility of AMCO is the relationship of the Puerto Rican
Cement Company with AMCO and the terms of any agreements.
We would also like his views on commodities other than
cement wirici can be siιμρού τα uesto co to the outer
islands and what commodities can be shipped on return
voyages. Another factor of interest is competition in the
shipping field.
5. SKEVER/1 indicated that he needed some clarifi-
cation of KUBARK objectives. Mr. Stanulis reviewed KUBARK
ostensible interest in having an experienced commercial man
in a commercially viable shipping company for the purpose.
✓of checking on Castro activities in the Caribbean area.
SKEWER/1 assumed that Mr. Fhilpotts was the man in whom
we are interested. Mr. Allen dispelled this assumption.
explaining that KUBARK has a candidate whom we would like
to place in a managerial position in A100 if it is ceter-
mined that NMCO is commercially viablo. KUBARK would seek
to effect this placement through a friend on the Board who,
like SKEWER/1, has helped KUBANK in the past and would
undoubtedly help again. SKEWER/1 said, "Oh, yes, through
the top man in the company." He then asked if Mr. Thilpotts
would know of KUBARK interest. Mr. Allen replied no,
emphasizing that our interest should be closely held.
:
6. SKEWER/1 said that he had not realized that we
wanted so much detail and asked if we desired to talk with
the man in his company most familiar with ANCO. Mr. Stanulis
declined, emphasizing that we wanted to keep our interest
in this matter confined solely to SKEWER/1. SKEWER/1 1m-
mediately agreed to make the necessary telephone calls to
obtain answers to our questions. As the basis for his
Inquiry, he would ask about the amount of credit extenced
by the Puerto Rican Cement Company to AMCO. SKEWER/L then
made a series of telephone calls to one of his subordinates
named Touns and also made one call to his son.
Information was obtained in the above telephone calls:
The following
a. AMCO has 2 or 3 ships under charter and ships
primarily coment to Martinque, Guadaloupe, Barbados,
and Antigue,

b. The uerto Rican Cement Company has a
verbal agreement with r. Thilpotts granting him
exclusive distribution of cement in Guadaloupe,
Barbados, and Antigua,
c. AMCO currently owes the Nuerto Rican
Cement Company $40,000 and is slow in payment.
d. The normal procedure for payment is for
the consignee to pay Mr. Philpotts by & note which
the Puerto Rican Cement Company discounts.
e. The Puerto Rican Cement Company is currently
examining how much credit it can extend to ANCO.
In this connection the company is examining whether
credit extended to AMCO can be insured under the
Foreign Credit Insurance Association. (FCIA insures
80% of export credit.) If so, the risk to the
Puerto Rican Cement Company would be reduced and
further credit could be extended.
f. The Puerto Rican Cement Company has sold
133,000 bags of cement to AMCO.
:
7. SKEWER/1 said that Mr. Philpotts is aggressive
and that he is pushing Fuerto Rican cement. Mr. Carter
csked SKEWER/1 if his firm were worried about the amount
of credit extended to AMCO. SKEWER/1 replied that AMCO
is trying to help the Puerto Rican Cement Company and
Puerto Rican Cement is in turn trying to help ANCO.
SKEWER/1 imparted the impression that he has absolute
confidence in his subordinates. In calling Tomas, SKEWER/1
said to us that he had gone over the head of his son.
SKEWER/1 was not aware that ANCO Puerto Rico is a subsidiary
of AMCO Panama. en apprised of this fact, he said that
this arrangement is probably for tax purposes. SKEWER/1
left the impression that he considers MMCO as a Puerto Rican
company and one worthy of support. He recalled that he had
previously given a job to a Trujillo opponent, Fred Imbert,
whom no one else would hire, Mr, Imbert now has his om
shipping company and SKEWER/1 suggested that we assess his
operation. He recalled that Mr. Trujillo had telephoned him
about harboring a criminal. SKEWER/I told Trujillo to mind
his own business as would SKEWER/L. Mr. Stanulis indicated
that KURARK would not want to consider Fred Imbert's opera-
tion, given his family's involvement in the Dominican
Republic. Throughout the conversation, the picture emerged
of a man who trusts his subordinates and who would help an
individual or fim, particularly fuerto Rican, which is also
trying to help his firm.

8. Mr. Allen said that we would assess the
situation carefully, and in the event it should be
determined to proceed, we would advise him. dr. Allen
informed him that two New York firms have invested
In ANCO, namely, W. S. Kies and Company, and Train,
Cabot and Associates. Our friend is er. Train, who,
as he surmised, is the top man in his firm. Mr. Allen
revealed this information to SKEWER/1 in the event
that it should be deemed desirable for Mr. Train to
negotiate with the Puerto Rican Cement Company. Con-
versely, in the event of ACO's failure, it was felt
that SREWER/1 should know that and is it Gamected
with any other participants. SKEWER/1 offered full
cooperation. ile had arranged his schedule to give us
as much time as necessary. In our presence he received
a telephone call in which he apologized for cancelling
an appointment in order to accommodate us. It is
considered that, as in his past relations with KUBARK,
SKEWER/1 can be trusted and will help KUBARK in any way
he can.

SUBJECT:
Project WUBRINY--Antilles Materials Company, Ltd.,
Discussion by Mr. Edward Stanulis with SKEWER/1.
1. I made initial telephonic contact with SKEWER/1 at approximately
1100 hours on 10 January 1965 and made arrangements for a meeting in my
hotel room for the following day between the hours of 1600 and 1700 to be
followed by another on Tuesday at a time and place that would be convenient
for SKEWER/1. Later in the day SKEWER/1 informed me that he would be
mmable to meet with us on Tuesday as he was leaving by air on the evening
of 11 January for a series of appointments in the States.
2. The meeting with SKEWER/1 was held in my hotel room at 1645
hours on 11 January. I told SKEWER/1 that as he knew, one of KUBARK'S
prime information targets in Latin America concerned the activities of
Castro's Cuba and that in this connection some of our people had been
thinking for some time that it would be most useful in pursuing this require-
ment to have entree into shipping interests that were active in Caribbean
waters, SKEWER/I said he thought this idea excellent. i further stated
that those people had heard that SKEWER/l's firm was discussing the possi-
bility of entering into an exclusive Caribbean distributorship contract with
Alvin T. Philpotts, Jr., who is associated with the Antilles Materials
Company, Ltd. S. A. of Panama and Puerto Rico, and asked him if he had
any knowledge of the individual or the negotiations. SKEWER/I replied
that he did not know of either, but that his son would be familiar with both.
3. I asked SKEWER/1 if he would be willing to investigate the situ-
ation discreetly without mentioning any interest on KUBARK's part and a
the same time consider the commercial feasibility of the venture for AMCO.
He agreed..
4. In elaborating on the basic concept, I told SKEWER/1 that if the
proper maritime firm were located (that is, one that may be floundering
now but has commercial viability potential), we would be interested in
placing with the company an individual who possesses the necessary com-
mercial background qualifications and also has the capability of accompli-
shing certain KUBARK requirements, SKEWER/1 reiterated his conviction
that the concept is an excellent one and said he would do all in his power to

help KUBARK achieve this objective.
5. I told him that I would appreciate his cooperation in meeting
with two of my friends who are more fully versed in these matters.
He agreed and set the meeting for Monday, 19 January 1965. SKEWER/1
gave me his unlisted private telephone numier and suggested that I con-
tact him Monday morning, 19 January 1965, to set time and place for
the meeting. The number is 842-2120.

report that his relations with the Puerto Rican Cement
Company are good. It also revealed the terms of the
relationship between the Fuerto Rican Cement Company
and AMCO which Mr. Philpotte had not reported in detail
to WUBRINY/2. It is obvious that Mr. Philpotts has

Cement Company who have the confidence of the Company's

have conned other businessmen into extending credit
and the amount of such credit is a key factor for in-

Allen his previous assessment of SKEWER/1, namely that
SKEWER/1 will do anything to help KUBARK, particularly
against Cuba, Mr. Stanulis will write a report upon

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: 303 Committee Meeting - 18 June 1964

1. Item I: Autonomous Operations

This was raised in view of Manuel Ray's request for
$25,000 and indications that he is attempting to make a new expedition to
Cuba in a chartered ship. Various courses of possible action with Ray
were discussed, ranging from cutting him off altogether to giving him
the money. It developed that Ray is acting inconsistently with the agreement
with him which was that he would operate outside the United States. Therefore
it was decided that we would tell him that he must abide by the agreement,
that he must find a base of operations outside the United States and if he does
we will endeavor to secure the release of his ship which is now in Puerto Rico,
and that we will give him financial support.

2. With respect to Artime, it was pointed out that Artime's
operations are very costly. CIA has put ($4.6 million) into this operation
this year the future bill will be large, but not as great. FitzGerald
reported that Artime planned one hit and run operation a month, but he noted
he would be lucky if he could pull off one every 3 months. Bundy seemed to
feel Artime was more of a threat than an operator and should be maintained
for that purpose and operations discouraged. FitzGerald pointed out this is
not practical. It was agreed to proceed with Artime recognizing that U.S.
or CIA support of him would probably be "blown". Furthermore it was
suggested that he be cautioned to be careful and not follow unduly reckless
courses of action.

3. There was a long discussion on the implications of the CIA
June 10th memorandum reporting plans of Cuban exiles to assassinate leading
Cuban government leaders. This report was taken most seriously by the group.
It was felt that the purpose of advising us through CIA of these plans was to
put us on notice and therefore we should not fail to take appropriate precautionary
actions to see that no assassination attempt of which we had knowledge was
carried out. It was decided that appropriate authorities, i.e. Department of
Justice and the FBI, should be notified and urged to take appropriate action
against the individuals involved.

I took the position that we are overly exercised, that I was
inclined to write the whole thing off as Miami cocktail party talk rather than
definite plans. Had I seen the Memo before it was distributed, I would have
investigated the sources and the credibility of the whole thing before taking
action. However the group were more concerned than I and therefore planning to
discuss the subject with the Attorney General and possibly Mr. Hoover.

I pointed out that copies of the Memorandum had been sent
to the Attorney General and the Department of Justice but there had been
no conversation on the subject.

ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms
steps we should take to establish the
credibility of the report; also communicate
with the FBI through Mr. Papich. Also I
should call the Attorney General personally.

4. Prior to the meeting Mr. Vance asked my opinion of using
the 22 million psyops leaflets which inadvertently had been printed on
U.S. manufactured white sulphite paper, all as reported in MACV
cable MAC SOG 5050 dated 18 June 1964 (IN 09143). I told Vance that I felt
we should go ahead. It was too bad it had been done this way, but it is one of
those things that a person not thoroughly acquainted with this type of operation
might overlook. He was in agreement and presumably will instruct the release
of the leaflets.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECOR D

SUBJECT: Special Group Meeting (5412) - 2 April 1964

1. Briefly reviewed the status of North Viet Nam operations 34A.
All concluded that the results have been negative and disappointing.
I took the position this was to be expected but that now the period of
organization had past, we might get some better results.

(The CIA IDEALIST-TACKLE program was approved except
for the North Korean flight. Defense interposed an objection to this
flight on the grounds that they were nearing agreement for the release
of helicopter crews which have been held in North Korean custody.

ACTION: This particular flight should be withheld.
USIB
and most particularly DIA should be informed in the meeting
On Wednesday, the 8th.7

2. (Discussed the problem of captains and crews for the SWIFT
and NASTY craft and the necessity of withdrawing the German mercenaries
and the Swedish captains. This was recognized as a must. It was agreed
that substitution of Chinese Nationalist captains was acceptable on an
interim basis.

ACTION: DDP to arrange with Secretary Vance for appro-
priate actions by the Department of Defense through their
representatives in Taiwan for the recruitment, movement,
compensation and care of these captains.7

3. Reviewed DoD peripheral reconnaissance which was approved
after extended discussion of capabilities of the new radar in Cambodia.
It was agreed that the field would be instruded to carefully observe
operation of this radar to determine whether the U-2s were being picked
up by it. If this turned out to be a regular practice by the Cambodians,
the matter should be resubmitted for reconsideration.

A CTION: The field should follow this carefully with MACV:

4. Review of ground rules for U-2 in North Viet Nam as outlined.
Secretary Vance's paper was approved.7

5. The recommendation to overfly Laos was held in suspension.
DoD was asked to bring in specific details of the particular 34A operations
which required such overflights and the probable advantages of continuing
the operations by means of overflying Laos. State held very positive view
against Laotian overflights.

6. The proposed in filtration and exfiltration operations in Cuba
were approved. Mr. FitzGerald was warned not to cache arms with
agents felt to be under Castro control. He stated that this particular
Cache involved money and other things, but no arms. The caching of
small quantities of arms elsewhere in Cuba was approved.
Memorandum on the operation of autonomous exile groups was noted and no
instructions were given to restrain these operations. The overall question
of future sabotage operations was discussed. Mr. Bundy agreed to bring
the matter before the President and senior Cabinet officers promptly.

7. The Chilean political action as outlined in the CIA paper of
April 1st was approved. It was pointed out that since the paper was
drafted, COS and Ambassador in Santiago had reached an agreement about
the handling of funds.

8. Proposed political action in Zanzibar was approved. Mr. Waller
gave a brief account of the results of the favorable negotiations with the
British. Understood that implementation of this paper was to be
coordinated with the British in accordance with agreement reached in
London.7

OTHER MATTERS:

1 ( Statement was made that a CIA U-2 was "painted" with radar
on February 24th, implication being that the CIA U-2$ in the vicinity of
Phnom Penh.

ACTION: I would like to know the facts on this

2. Question was raised about need for continuing the 30 mile
intrusion into Cambodiand Laos. Indications were that the photography
had produced no useful information for MACV.

ACTION: This question should be studied and brought
up for discussion at meeting on April 9th. I should cable
Carter to investigate fully.7

27 February 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting of 5412 Group

1. The question of the extent of the SAC planes operations in South
Vietnam was discussed against the background of Dr. McMillan's
letter of February 26th.

1. Overflights of South Vietnam -- Ο.Κ.

2. Overfly that part of North Vietnam which is within 30 miles
of South Vietnam or of the coast line.

3. That part of Laos which is within 30 miles of the South
Vietnamese border.

4. That part of Cambodia which is not more than 30 miles
from South Vietnam.

With respect to 4., instructions were to be given that the primary
purpose of the flights was to survey border activity and the 30 mile shot
is provided to give range and operational flexibility. I felt in reviewing
McMillan's proposal that if the SAC planes were to go as far north as the
21st parallel, then they should go all the way to the China border and the
proposed CIA operation out of Takhli should be abandoned. This raised the
question of whether civilian or military planes and pilots should be over
North Vietnam to the extent which could not be explained as being "off
course". All agreed that the SAC Air Force operations should be either
limited as outlined above or should cover the entire country. It was
decided to refer the matter to higher authority for decision. I interposed
no objection to SAC's overflight of North Vietnam but merely took the
position that if they went as far north as proposed by McMillan, they
should cover the entire country.7

2. The program of infiltration and exfiltration of Cuba was approved
with the exception of one operation operation #434 about which
Mr. Cheever explained that he thought the agents we were resupplying were
under Cuban control and the resupply operation was for the purpose of
deception. It was agreed that the resupply should be confined to money and

medicine and that the small amount of arms involved should not be cached.
Otherwise the operation was approved.

Alexis Johnson and Mr. Bundy raised questions of the consequences
of finding an arms cache or knocking over an infiltration at the time of the
OAS debate on the Venezuelan problem. Arguments were persuasive that
we should go slowly during this period. I read from the February 25th
Cuban checklist of the deterioration of the spirit of the people of Cuba, the
feeling that we were about to recognize the Castro government and the apathy
toward further resistance as evidence of the price we are paying for
slow-downs and deferments of action against Cuba. I said that I thought our
Cuban program was in complete disarray. We had no policy or covert
operations. We now are hesitating on infiltration and exfiltration, our
economic denial program was failing, while Castro is making significant
progress.

3. The forcast of NRO activities for March was approved.

4. The status report on political action in Kenya was approved.

February 10, 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. McGEORGE BUNDY

Attached is a paper which I would like to table for
discussion at the next meeting of the 5412 group.

February 10, 1964

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Clandestine and Covert Activities Against Cuba

The objective of the U. S. Government is to overthrow
the Castro/Communist regime in Cuba. In accomplishing its
objective, the U. S. is not willing to risk nuclear war or, at
this time, substantial deterioration in its relations with its
Allies, or significant escalation in tensions between this
country and the Soviets. Thus, any covert U. S. program
should be set at a level that is not likely to incur such risks.
Such a program would appear to be a low-risk, clandestine
program of harassment and sabotage directed against Cuba.
In addition, a program of higher risks seems justified when
it is directed against Cuban subversion of Latin America.

Actions Against Cuba

1. Sabotage. A low level campaign of sabotage and
harassment against Cuba might include such targets as the
Canete Saw Mill, smaller POL storage plants (such as the
one at Pilon), the Nazabal warehouse and pier, and ships
(such as barges or Cuban patrol boats). Where possible,
it would seem desirable to make the raids appear to have
come from within Cuba. Cuban ships outside Cuba can be sabotaged
by discreet means (such as placing sand in gears or sugar in fuel).

2. Harassment of Free World Shipping to Cuba.

a) Initiate a more comprehensive program of
overt and covert pressure against Free World firms trading
with Cuba. In this connection, develop a comprehensive list
of firms doing business with Cuba, check them against known
DOD off-shore and foreign purchase suppliers so that
:
appropriate retaliation can be applied against those suppliers.

b) Place unactivated incendiary and explosive
devices in cargoes and on ships bound for Cuba and subse-
quently "tip off" port or shipping officials so that they will
search and discover the devices with the attendant publicity.

3. Covert Economic Activities.

a) Intensify covert activities directed against
critical commodities destined for Cuba with resort, if
necessary, to carefully considered and controlled preclu-
sive buying.

b) Make it known discreetly through the press
that we maintain careful records of the companies dealing
with Cuba, suggesting without saying so that these records
constitute a potential "blacklist."

c) Form a group of responsible and qualified
Cuban exile businessmen to maintain pressure on firms
trading with Cuba by indicating that such firms will have
no future in a post-Castro Cuba.

4. To the extent possible, encourage dissidence
among different factions in Cuba - Peking, Moscow,
Nationalist -- by spreading rumors, internal and
external sabotage designed to accomplish this purpose
(such as actions against homes of leaders, etc).

Actions Against Cuban Subversion in Latin America

1. Develop a list of vulnerable Cuban agents in Latin
America against whom a concentrated program of bribery,
blackmail and coercion can be instituted.

2. Carefully select key Latin American members of
the Havana-Peking school and institute a program of kidnapping,
and personal and physical harassment, while attempting to
attribute these acts to rivals who support Moscow. Institute
the reverse process as a retaliatory program against Moscow
supporters.

Any of the foregoing activities would be conducted against
a background of U. S. propaganda (black, white and gray) and
political activity designed to increase internal dissension within
Cuba, to support economic isolation of Cuba, to avoid splitting
with our allies over the Cuban issue and to reduce, and perhaps
eliminate, Castro subversion of Latin America. In addition,
surveillance activities should be significantly stepped up.

GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION
1. During the past year and a half AMLEO-3 has been placated,
and kept under control, by the continuous effort of KUBARK to assist
him in obtaining asylum for his wife and family in a third country
diplomatic installation in Cuba. Since the failure of the last
asylum attempt for Mrs. AMLEO-3 in March 1964, as reported in refer-
ence I, and the refusal of Mrs. AMLEO-3 to even consider taking asylum
without advance guarantees of a salvo conducto; AMLEO-3 lost what
little optimism he had remaining for a safe method of bringing his
wife and children out of Cuba. After the failure of the asylum
attempt in March 1964, Mrs. AMLEO-3 again renewed her attack upon
AMLEO-3 by phone and letter, urging him to rescue her by any means
at his disposal, and by her efforts she has successfully convinced him
that his family will escape only if she can arrange an exfiltration
mounted from inside the island, or if AMLEO-3 sends someone to get her
or comes himself to exfiltrate her and their children. Up until
recently the C/O has been able to persuade AMLEO-3 that undertakings
of this nature were foolhardy unless carried out by trained maritime
assets skilled in clandestine infiltration and exfiltration, and
equipped with the proper vessels and support to carry out the mission
successfully. Now that the KUBARK asylum efforts have been discon-
tinued, and AMLEO-3 is aware that KUBARK will not sponsor any maritime

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
exfiltration attempts to rescue his family, he has decided that he
would prefer to terminate his relationship with KUBARK so that he can
carry out such exfiltration attempts on his own in a completely
independent manner.

2. Since November 1963, JMWAVE has noted in all AMLEO progress
reports that Mrs. AMLEO-3 was dabbling in exfiltration attempts in-
side Cuba, and has also successfully managed to pry funds out of
AMLEO-3 in attempts to buy her way into such efforts. As a result
AMLEO-3 has borrowed money from AMSHED-1 and family relatives in the
U.S. attempting to support his wife in these attempts, and is now in
debt to these individuals to the tune of $4-$5,000.00, On 5 May 1964,
AMLEO-3 informed his C/Outhat he had recently heard from his wife via
the Japanese diplomatic Courier channel and in her letter she had
told him that she planned to participate in an exfiltration attempt
from inside the Island the weekend of 10 May 1964. AMLEO-3 requested
the C/O to alert QKMAGNET to this attempt, and said that he expected
to have confirmation of the attempt by 1900 hours on 10 May 1964.
Nothing was heard from AMLEO-3 the night of 10 May 1964, but the fol-
lowing morning, at 0840 hours 11 May 1964, AMLEO-3 contacted the C/O
and gave him the following information:
"The exfiltration of my family will begin on the night
of 11 May 1964, and the group will consist of some 11
adults and children. They plan to depart from Playa
de Guanabo, between Havana and Matanzas, during the
night of 11 May 1964 and expect to arrive in Key West,
Florida sometime on 12 May 1964."

AMLEO-3 claimed he knew nothing about what type of boat the group
planned to use, nor the exact time of departure, route the boat would
follow, etc. It was not until 13 May 1964, that AMLEO-3 mentioned
to Bruce P. VEDDER and Leon C. FLUTEO, during a routine operational
meeting, that he had sponsored and masterminded the aborted exfiltratio
operation, and that the operation had been mounted from the U.S., and
not from inside the island, as he had previously claimed to the C/O.

3. On 14 May 1964, the C/O contacted AMLEO-3 and requested an
explanation of his sponsorship of the exfiltration operation. AMLEO-3
claimed he no longer felt bound to confide these activities on his
part to KUBARK, since KUBARK had refused to continue_its effort to
rescue his wife and family from Cuba, and furthermore that he would
continue such unilateral exfiltration efforts with or without KUBARK
help until he either rescued his family from Cuba, or died in his
attempts to do so. AMLEO-3 claims he organized the trip of the M/V
ADA by passing himself off as a PBPRIMER, and utilized the following
individuals in the operation.

A. Mario REMIS, probably identical with Mario REMIS-
CAMEJO, A-12 834 780; PDOB, Havana, Cuba on 6/20/23; who formerly
resided at Calle 130A, #36506, Wajay, Marianao, Havana, Cuba; came
to the U.S. from Cuba in August 1962 departing from Guanabo by small
boat with five other Cuban refugees. AMLEO-3_claims he used this
individual as his principal organizer in the expedition, and REMIS
had agreed to go into Cuba acting as a guide and leader of the group.
REMIS had previously resided in an area close to AMLEO-3's home in
Wajay, Cuba and had agreed to go to A-3's home and bring his family
out. REMIS did recruit and organize the boat crew, but at the last
minute supposedly was unable to make the trip because of other
committments_and instead turned his responsibilities over to the next
individual Daniel (RODRIGUEZ) Santos.

B. Daniel (RODRIGUEZ) Santos is the owner of the M/V
ADA, and brought the boat out from Cuba in his escape in November 1963
Since REMIS could not make the trip, he and A-3 reportedly briefed
RODRIGUEZ on the location of A-3's home in Wajay, and supplied him
with a recent photograph of Mrs. AMLEO-3 and her children, and AMLEO-3
wrote a bona fides message in his own handwriting on the back of the
photograph and also listed his home address without revealing (he says

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
the true name of his wife. (This photograph was brought back by
RODRIGUEZ and returned to AMLEO-3). RODRIGUEZ then reportedly agreed
to lead the infiltration mission, and personally contact AMLEO-3's
family and the family of Jesus GOMEZ Calzadilla in Guines, Cuba and
take them to the exfiltration point. RODRIGUEZ also planned to bring
out his fiancee, and the other boat crew members had agreed to bring
out one or two relatives each, the total number of passengers was not
supposed to exceed 15 persons.

c. Armando BLANCO Lorenzo, Romelio LOPEZ Sosa, and
AMBIG-4 were recruited by RODRIGUEZ for the mission, and supposedly
AMLEO-3 did not have contact with them prior to the mission, nor were
they witting that he was one of the sponsors of the mission. AMBIG-4
was to bring out his father, mother, sister, younger brother, and his
own and LOPEZ's fiancees; BLANCO his wife and daughter; RODRIGUEZ,
his fiancee, and the wives and children of AMLEO-3 and Jesus GOMEZ
Calzadilla. AMLEO-3 has never been informed by his C/O that AMBIG-4
was a KUBARK asset, and AMLEO-3 has never indicated in any way that he
knew AMBIG-4 was a KUBARK asset. Since the boat in question, the M/V
ADA, was not equipped with a radio set, AMBIG-4 was obviously not
desired for use as a radio operator by the group.

4. AMLEO-3 informed the C/O that he had previously warned his
wife that something was to happen the weekend of 10 May 1964, and that
someone would be coming to see her with bona fides from him. Mrs.
AMLEO-3 also was instructed to supply this contact man with all the
pesos she had at her disposal, since the infiltrees reportedly were
able to take in only $170.00 worth of pesos with them. Since_the
abort of the mission, Mrs. AMLEO-3 has talked to A-3 by phone at least
three times, and she claims no one ever contacted her; that no one
has bothered her since the failure of the mission; and that she is
reportedly not under control or surveillance by the Cuban Intelligence
Services.

CHRONOLOGICAL ACCOUNT OF UNSUCCESSFUL EXFILTRATION MISSION OF M/V ADA
4 May-8. May 1964
5. During this period the gasoline, food, and other necessities
were purchased along with four sets of green fatigues which the group
bought in a local Army/Navy store. They were also equipped with two
Colt .45 Cal pistols, one P-38 pistol, one Browning automatic 38 Cal
pistol, and 250 rounds of ammunition for the four weapons. These
weapons were taken on the mission for self defense purposes only.
The boat, the M/V ADA, was located at Sunset Harbor Marina, Stock
Island, Key West, Florida.

9 May 1964
6. On 9 May 1964, at approximately 1800 hours, the M/V ADA
departed from Sunset Harbor Marina, Stock Island, Key West, Fla for
Cuba. The crew was made up of Daniel RODRIGUEZ Santos, Rogelio LOPEZ
Sosa, Armando BLANCO Lorenzo, and AMBIG-4, The M/V ADA was enroute
to Cuba during the remainder of 9 May 1964, and nothing unusual
reportedly occurred during the voyage.

10 May 1964
7. The infiltration crew arrived in Cuba at a point approxi-
mately mile east of Playa Guanabo on 10 May 1964 at 1625 hours.
There was no beach per se at this spot but reefs from 6 to 9 feet high
They had difficulty mooring the boat because the water was turbulent
at the base of the reefs. In broad daylight, all four went ashore and
walked across the highway 'Via Blanca'. There were several empty
trenches between the highway and the coast line, but the group could
detect no vigilance in the area. LOPEZ was left hidden in the bushes
near the highway, while the other three proceeded into Guanabo to
o meet RODRIGUEZ contact. (in the CAC debriefing LOPEZ named one
Paulo MARTINEZ as RODRIGUEZ' contact in Guanabo. AMLABEL-1 states he
asked the name of this contact several times, but each time LOPEZ

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
maintained that he did not know. AMLEO-3 also refused to tell the
C/O who the inside contact man in Guanabo was for the group. LOPEZ
may have let the name slip during his CAC debriefing, or else fabri-
cated a name.)
8. LOPEZ began to count cars to while away the time. During
the period 1630-1900 hours LOPEZ counted 38 6X6 type trucks with
approximately 50 militia each, all travelling in the direction of
Matanzas. One other truck, containing about 15 negroes and 6 whites,
who LOPEZ states were not Cubans, was observed going in the same
easterly direction. LOPEZ states that the traffic was unusually heavy
in both directions. RODRIGUEZ returned about 1900 and he and LOPEZ
went back to the boat. RODRIGUEZ told LOPEZ that he had been able to
get transportation for both AMBIG-4 and BLANCO; AMBIG-4 to Quivican and
BLANCO to Artemisa where their respective families are located.
RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ took the boat out about a mile, shut off the
engine and went to sleep. (The above information in para 8 is the
version AMLABEL-1 obtained from LOPEZ.)

9. In the AMLEO-3 version of this period, again acquired from
LOPEZ, AMLEO-3 reported the following activity: Upon his return to
the boat about 1900 hours, RODRIGUEZ saw LOPEZ and told him to wait
and then RODRIGUEZ returned to Guanabo to see his fiance and reportedly
to establish contact with friends of A-3 in the GOC. A-3 would_not
say how these contacts were carried out, but due to the time factor
it-is assumed they could only have been done by phone. A-3 claims
the contacts were as follows:

A. A high level civilian official of the GOC, with the
rank of Comandante probably in MINCONS, who is willing to collaborate
with the Rebel Army in exile, and willing to furnish their infiltrated
agents with official GOC vehicles to travel anywhere in the provinces
of Havana, Pinar del Rio, or Matanzas in order to carry out their
missions.

B. Some unnamed high level Cuban military officers.

A-3 claims that these officials are willing to listen to the Rebel Army
exiles, but do not intend to do anything positive with them unless they
demonstrate their power by eliminating AMTHUG-1, or carrying out
some type of pe of strong action that would prove they had strong outside
backing. AMLEO-3 stated that he would be more than willing to collab-
orate with KUBARK in furthering contact with these unnamed individuals
if KUBARK would support him in a future exfiltration to rescue his
family from Cuba. AMLEO-3 refused to provide any further information
relative to these supposed inside contacts of his. AMLEO-3 states
that RODRIGUEZ returned to the boat about 2330 hours on 10 May 1964,
and then he and LOPEZ boarded the boat and went out to sea for the
night. A-3 also stated that LOPEZ told him that at least eight local
fisherman dropped by to look at the boat while it remained at the reef,
and nothing was done to insure the cooperation of the fishermen nor
did LOPEZ attempt to hold them at the spot to prevent their informing
on the infiltration to local security authorities.

11 May 1964
10. After putting out to sea, RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ slept during
the night and awoke the next morning, 11 May, at about 1130 hours to
find themselves directly across from the city of Matanzas. They
returned to the Guanabo area about 2030 hours. (LOPEZ said the boat
would only do about 4 to 6 knots). They took the boat back close to
the original landing place, waited to see some light signals indi-
cating all was clear, and when they didn't see them they decided to
go in anyway and investigate. When approximately_20 yards off shore,
they were fired upon by automatic weapons and a spotlight came on
searching for them. The boat party was not hit by the fire and re-
treated to the open sea.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
11. The boat then travelled east for approximately two to three
miles down the coast from Guanabo, and they attempted to land on the
beach again. Due to large rocks and heavy surf they decided not to
attempt a landing and instead anchored the boat beyond the surf line
(about 30 yards out) and both RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ swam into the beach.
RODRIGUEZ went inland and caught a bus to Guanabo, and they went back
to the safehouse of Paulo MARTINEZ 06 At the safehouse he found the
pickup team of BLANCO and AMBIG-4, and some 28 people whom they had
acquired as passengers. These passengers were all relatives of BLANCO
and AMBIG-4, and BLANCO and AMBIG-4 told RODRIGUEZ they had been unable
to locate the homes of Jesus_GOMEZ_Calzadilla and AMLEO-3 and therefore
had not been able to contact these families. They then returned the
bona fides photos and messages to RODRIGUEZ to take back to AMLEO-3
and GOMEZ. (AMLEO-3 commented bitterly on this point stating that
AMBIG-4 and BLANCO probably went to their own homes first, and after
seeing the number of their relatives who wanted to come, never even
tried to find his home nor that of GOMEZ.) RODRIGUEZ, AMBIG-4, and
BLANCO agreed upon another exfiltration point to the east of Guanabo,
and arranged recognition signals. RODRIGUEZ then returned to the boat,
leaving AMBIG-4 and BLANCO to convoy the passengers in three cars to
the exfiltration point.
12. RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ arrived at the exfiltration point about
20 minutes after the appointed our of 2300, and halted the boat about
100 meters offshore.
They saw a light on top of the reef at which
point RODRIGUEZ told LOPEZ that the light was the proper signal,
(When asked about the recognition signals, LOPEZ stated that he did not
know what the exact signals were, but that they involved 2 or 3 lights
and an exchange of names. He maintains that RODRIGUEZ handled all
these details). They brought the boat right up to the reef at which
point they were fired upon from the top of the cliffs from the directio
of the highway. (AMLABEL-1 asked LOPEZ how they had planned to get
women and children down these steep cliffs. LOPEZ replied that the
difficulties-involved had not occurred to them. By the same token,
they had no extra food on board the boat to feed the families.)

13. RODRIGUEZ shouted to LOPEZ to jump overboard to use the
boat as protection against the rifle fire. LOPEZ states that RODRIGUE:
was hit as he jumped overboard. RODRIGUEZ could not swim because of
his shoulder wound. On RODRIGUEZ' command, LOPEZ (who by this time
had RODRIGUEZ around his neck) started to swim toward shore. LOPEZ
decided this avenue of escape was foolish, and turned back toward the
boat. LOPEZ pulled RODRIGUEZ aboard. He then claims that the rifle
(FAL) and machine gun fire was redirected, at this point, in toward
land rather than out to sea toward their boat. LOPEZ states that
this diversion was the only thing which saved them.

14. LOPEZ started the motor and was proceeding north when he
saw the signal lights of 6 or 7 small boats ringed in a semi-circle
in front of his boat. LOPEZ apprised RODRIGUEZ (laid out flat on the
deck) of this new development. Even though bleeding and barely con-
scious RODRIGUEZ asked LOPEZ if he could see the lights of Matanzas
City. LOPEZ said he could. RODRIGUEZ advised him to head toward
Matanzas hugging the coastline. The patrol craft (or fishing boats)
had since extinguished their lights. LOPEZ followed his advice and
several hours later arrived off Matanzas City having eluded the patrol
craft. RODRIGUEZ then told LOPEZ to turn the boat to the left until
the compass showed "N", straighten out and follow that course to Key
West. Three or four of the gas tanks had been pierced by the barrage,
and there was barely enough gas left to make it to Key West.
last remaining water tank was also shot up. They arrived at approxi-
mately 1730 hours at Sunset Harbor Marina, Stock Island, Key West,
Fla. on 12 May 1964.

AFTER ACTION REPORTS
16. After the abortive exfiltration attempt by the M/V ADA,
various relatives of people involved began to receive telephone calls
and telegrams from Cuba reporting on the arrest or safety of various
individuals. The following excerpts were taken from various BARR cable
and debriefings of Romelio LOPEZ Sosa and AMLEO-3:

A. On 13 May 1964, AMSWIRL-1 visited Tomas RODRIGUEZ
Fuentes, of 1021 Margaret Street, Key West, former Captain with the
National Police in Havana who had received a telegram from his daughte
Elsa OLIVERA, at 0920 hours 13 May 1964. (She was supposed to have con
out with BLANCO and AMBIG-4 in the exfiltration). The telegram stated
(English translation) "Congratulations, we are well, love to all,
embrace. Your daughter.", and supposedly indicated the daughter was
safe.

B. On 14 May 1964, AMSWIRL-1 was told by Daniel RODRIGUE
Santos that Valentin BLANCO, relative of Armando BLANCO Lorenzo, had
received three telegrams from Cuba: the first on 10 May stated
"Armando arrived all is well"; the second on 11 May stated, "Armando
departed, all is well"; and the third on 13 May stated, "Yesterday's
cable no good, Armando admitted or hospitalized", meaning Armando
BLANCO had been picked up by Cuban authorities.

c. On 14 May 1964, AMLEO-3 called the C/O and informed
him that the 14 year old son of Mario REMIS (see para 3 A above) had
called his father in Miami at 1130 hours that same date, and told him
he had been arrested along with his mother and some other people while
trying to leave Cuba, and that the police had let the children free,
but continued to hold the adults under arrest. Reportedly only
one car had been picked up near the exfiltration point, and the people
in the other two cars had supposedly escaped arrest for the time being
As of 23 May 1964, no other information has been reported to KUBARK
on the fate of BLANCO, AMBIG-4, or the passengers who were at the
exfiltration point.

GENERAL COMMENTS ON TRIP OF THE M/V ADA
17. As noted in paragraph 8 of reference J, various operational
inconsistencies still exist in the account submitted above re the
exfiltration trip of the M/V ADA to Cuba. WAVE is of the opinion
that some of these inconsistencies can be attributed to genuine con-
fusion of facts by the principal source of information, Rogelio LOPEZ
Sosa, (who did not see the infiltration team of BLANCO and AMBIG-4
again after their infiltration inland), and the withholding of facts
by AMLEO-3 who considers this activity was his own personal būsiness
and had nothing to do with KUBARK. Daniel RODRIGUEZ Santos is
probably more knowledgeable of exactly what occurred during the infil-
tration, but due to his illness AMSWIRL-1 was not able to interrogate
him in Key West, and reportedly RODRIGUEZ is still very ill and
KUBARK does not consider it worthwhile to attempt an interrogation
of him at this time. It is also believed that RODRIGUEZ will withhold
information he considers privileged, and it has been noted that
AMLEO-3's principal organizer of the expedition, Mario REMIS, has
been visiting RODRIGUEZ daily in Mount Sinai hospital in Miami, Fla.
Since the two infiltrees, BLANCO and AMBIG-4, are either under arrest
or in hiding it is doubtful that their inside activities relative to
AMLEO-3's family etc., will ever be completely clarified.'
18. As noted in paragraph 9 of reference J, AMLEO-3 continues
to look for methods whereby he may exfiltrate his family from Cuba,
and has reached the point where he is no longer rational in his
reasoning re the risk factors to himself or his family. AMLEO-3 is

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
definitely acting out of dosperation, and although he does not desire
to burn all his KUBARK bridges behind him, he feels that he must since
KUBARK will not permit him to undertake such activities while under our
control. WAVE's position on the matter has been fully stated in
paragraph 9 of reference J. On 22 May 1964 WAVE requested BARR to con-
tact AMSWIRL-1 and inform him that KUBARK was desirous of having him
insure that the M/V ADA was not permitted to carry out further family
rescue missions to Cuba at this time.
