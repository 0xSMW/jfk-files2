1. The briefing was held in a small luxurious government conference room on the afternoon of Friday 9 October 1964, lasting about 2 1/2 hours.  (Chief of state Colonel Peralta, Minister of Government Colonel Serrano and Intelligence Chief Colonel Porres attended for the Guatemalans.

TWO CIA OFFICERS WERE PRESENT

2. At the request of the SENIOR CIA OFFICER prefixed the operational briefing with a brief description of how the U. S. Intelligence community operates, of the role of CIA, of the need for compartmentation and security, and specifically of how the foregoing considerations make it imperative for (the Guatemalans) to adopt security precautions which will ensure that the information we provide and the joint operations we undertake are compartmented within the Guatemalen government (and, in fact, discussed by the Guatemalan government exclusively with our representatives in the fisia).

3. Following the introductory remarks outlined above, I briefed the group on the DGI structure, the DGI operational techniques, and specifically on DGI aims and operations in Guatemala. The (president)lent close attention throughout the briefing and examined the exhibits closely, including the DGI intelligence requirements for (Guatemala) and the (Salvadoran "Caso Zapato" file).

4. After the foregoing exposition, I explained our aims in exploiting the information

in this connection! asked for close cooperation and coordination of activities, promising that we shall do our utmost and making reference to our travel lists and watch list.

h. The effectiveness of his own actions against guerrillas in (Guatemala) and his determination to "meet violence with violence;"

i. Recognition of the importance of the information covered in the briefing and of its exploitation;

j. Reference to the case of the (Mexican courier) working for (Cuban intelligence) and now detained in (Guatemala).

k. Acceptance of security restrictions and his decision to hold the information to those present.

l. In replying to the remarks of Colonel Peralta, I said that we appreciate the cooperation of Guatemala in the OAS and that we shall be most interested in the exploitation of the possibilities in the present case. I added that the matter of using force against Cuba is a policy matter on which I was not competent to comment but that the decisions made by the United States Government are based on careful study of detailed information (including information on Soviet intentions and capabilities.

8. At the conclusion of the meeting, (Peralta) asked for a copy of the requirements (which he already had gone over closely) and took the copy with him to study further.

ANOTHER
5. With reference to (Dalton's) case, because of the developments and plans in (El Salvador), I explained briefly the status of the (DALTON card)and the possibility of his being transferred to Guatemala). (This was in line with the discussion that occurred in (El Salvador) which included our officer, the Crealdent and the President's intelligence advisor, Colonel MEDRANO). In that the Guatemalan government take no action unless requested by President RIVERA or Colonel MEDRANO and that, if (DALTON) is transferred, one of our people probably would talk to (DALTONs) in (Guatemala)).

3. The (Chief of State Peralta) made a rather impassioned speech in which he covered the following points:

a. His own long experience in the OAS, in Cuba and in Central America;

b. His early warnings about Castro--which were disregarded;

c. The extent to which Guatemala has lived up to its obligations in the OAS; to which it has cooperated in efforts against Castro; and to which it has looked toward U.S. leadership;

d. The failure of the U. S. to take aggressive action against Cuba and the need for taking a hard line, including the use of force in support of military activity by the free Cubans and the other American countries;

e. His appreciation that the Soviets will not be willing to risk a nuclear war over Cuba;

f. Condemnation of Mexico for her dealings with Cuba, for failure to abide by her obligations in the OAS, and for permitting the Castroites to operate out of Mexico against other American countries;

g. The need for action against Mexico;

DBA 31-1065

Copy to: I - INS, Miami, Florida (All 877 123)(RM)

Report of: EUGENE L. PAYNE
Dates: DEC-10-1962
Field Office File: 105-6466
Title: FELIPE VIDAL SANTIAGO
Character: INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

Synopsis: Subject, a Cuban refugee, entered the U. S. on 8/9/60, from Colombia. Subject defected from the CASTRO govern- ment while employed as Cuban Naval Attache in Caracas, Venezuela. Subject is a former graduate of the Cuban Naval Academy and in exile has been involved in considerable anti-CASTRO clandestine activity against Cuba. Subject has affiliated with various anti-CASTRO organizations in the Miami, Fla., area and in 11/62, was reported to be associated with an individual having contacts with a Guatemala government official.

DETAILS: PREDICATION

Investigation in this matter was based upon information from MM T-1, another government agency which conducts security and intelligence-type investigations, who advised on August 8, 1962, that information had been received from a sub-source of unknown reliability, who advised as follows:

FELIPE VIDAL, 2293 N. W. 7th Street, Miami, Florida, an individual who formerly held a responsible position in the Cuban Navy, had accompanied an individual identified as JACK CANNON, a United States citizen, on an anti-CASTRO clandestino trip to Cuba between October 18 and 23, 1961, in which they were purportedly transporting $80,000.00 worth of arms. The boat operated by CANNON, who also uses the name JACK SHEA, and the subject was sunk along the North Coast of Cuba and the arms were lost.

Although CANNON was allegedly engaged in anti- CASTRO activities, MM T-1's sub-source pointed out that after dealing with him in business and learning about his background, he suspected that CANNON was actually involved in clandestine missions for the CASTRO regime with ramifications relating to criminal activity in the Miami area.

BACKGROUND

A. Residence

According to the records of Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Miami, Florida, as made available on December 6, 1962, by CHARLES CHALLANDES, Investigator, subject resides at 2293 N. W. 7th Street, Miami, Florida.

B. Birth Data and Alien Status

On June 14, 1961, INS, Miami, Florida, made available to the Miami Office information relating to

political refugees entering the United States since January 1, 1959. Included in this list was FELIPE VIDAL SANTIAGO, born February 3, 1926, at Havana, Cuba.

On December 6, 1962, Investigator CHALLANDES, mentioned above, made available their file Number All 877 123 relating to the subject, which contained the following infor- mation:

VIDAL arrived in the United States on August 9, 1960, from Bogota, Colombia, and applied for a B-2 visa for four months to visit his refugee wife. He pointed out he was a Lieutenant in the Cuban Navy from 1944 to 1956. In 1958 he affiliated himself with FIDEL CASTRO and after January 1, 1959, he was appointed Chief of the Maritime Police by the CASTRO government. On October 16, 1959, he was appointed Naval Attache at Caracas, Venezuela. He defected on March 7, 1960, in Caracas because of the communist infiltration of the Cuban government.

On April 8, 1961, VIDAL applied for political asylum. VIDAL indicated that in the United States he would reside at 708 N. W. 23rd Street, Miami, Florida, and had in his possession a document identifying himself as the co- ordinator of the anti-CASTRO organization Movimiento de Liberacion Democratico Revolucionario.

On August 10, 1960, INS obtained a sworn signed statement from VIDAL in which he stated he was discharged from the Cuban Navy under the government of FULGENCIO BATISTA because of his opposition to BATISTA.

VIDAL indicated he never joined the July 26th revolutionary of FIDEL CASTRO, but was affiliated with all groups of the revolution. In October, 1957, VIDAL was co-ordinator of the Organizacion Accion Resistencia (The Clandestine Resistence Action Organization). He pointed out that in Havana, Cuba, he participated in dissemination of propaganda, sabotage, organized strikes, and meetings in jails, all on behalf of the CASTRO revolution.

VIDAL pointed out that in 1958 a pact was formed in Caracas naming MANUEL URRUTIA as President of the new government, but that CASTRO later usurped the presidency. After URRUTIA was overthrown, VIDAL became disenchanted and began to cooperate with anti-CASTRO organizations. He asked for foreign duty, and after noting continued CASTRO activities against the government of ROMULO BETANCOURT and the movement of Russian agents to Cuba, he removed his family from Cuba, went to Colombia, and defected.

VIDAL emphasized that he had never been a member of the Communist Party in Cuba.

On October 3, 1962, MM T-2, a Cuban refugee familiar with certain phases of anti-CASTRO activity in the Miami area and who has limited information regarding communist activities in Cuba, advised that captioned subject was personally known to him in Cuba, where he had the repu- tation of being an opportunist and extremely fond of drinking and carousing. He was a Captain in CASTRO's Navy in Cienfuegos, Cuba.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES SINCE DEFECTION FROM CASTRO REGIME

The December 7, 1960, issue of "La Prensa," a daily Spanish language newspaper published in New York, carried an article entitled, "Establish United Cuban Front in Miami." This article stated that the United Front of Liberation in the City of Miami was announced by members of the group, which included Commander FELIPE VIDAL SANTIAGO of the Movement of Democratic Revolutionary Liberation, among others.

On February 20, 1961, MM T-3, a Cuban familiar with certain Cuban activity in the Miami area, advised SANTIAGO VIDAL and another individual of an anti-CASTRO group are purchasing radio equipment.

On April 4, 1961, CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, former President of Cuba, advised an Agent of the FBI that a boat owned by FELIPE VIDAL SANTIAGO, former Cuban Naval Attache to Caracas, Venezuela, had been dispatched to the coast of Cuba. The boat had been gone approximately ten days and had not yet returned. PRIO advised the purpose of the trip was to bring out of Cuba a close friend of PRIO, identified as JULIO GARCERAN, former magistrate of the Supreme Court of Cuba. GARCERAN was to be brought to the South Florida area in VIDAL's boat.

The July 4, 1961, issue of the "Diario las Americas," a Spanish language newspaper published in Miami, carried an article entitled, "United Front for National Liberation,"

lating in effect that the Constitution of 1940 would be restored by the liberating army and unify 1 the Cuban anti-communist forces. The article bore the signature of Commander FELIPE VIDAL SANTIAGO on behalf of the "Democratic Recovery of Cuba."

The April 27, 1962, issue of the "Miami Herald," a daily newspaper published in Miami, carried an article pertaining to the training of exiles in the Miami area, Subject, on behalf of the United Liberation Front, was listed as one of the participants in this training.

On May 25, 1962, MM T-1 advised that subject would in all probability be included in the military comission of anti-CASTRO Cuban exiles which was being organized by Central American countries to cooperate in action against the CASTRO government.

On August 8, 1962, MM T-1, as previously indicated, advised that JACK CANNON, who claims he is engaged in anti- CASTRO activities and has made 43 clandestine trips to Cuba in various ships, transporting arms and documents and ex- filtrating people, advised his ship was sunk somewhere along the North Coast of Cuba, but was able to save himself in a small plastic boat with an outboard motor which was on board, and arrived in Cay Sals. He reportedly was ac- companied on the trip by FELIPE VIDAL, 2293 N. W. 7th Street, Miami, Florida, who formerly held a responsible position in the Cuban Navy during the CASTRO regime. On this trip, CANNON said they were transporting $80,000.00 worth of arms and these were reportedly lost when the boat sank.

According to the source of MM T-1, JACK CANNON, who's a United States citizen and former CASTRO guerrilla- man, is suspected of working for the Cuban government. He resides at 2020 N. E. 135th Street, North Miami, Florida, where he and his Cuban wife, MARIA SUAREZ, are tenants. The source of MM T-1 advised he had had some business relations with CANNON and upon obtaining some information about him, strongly suspects he is involved in some clandes- tine mission for the CASTRO regime, with ramifications of criminal offenses in Miami. He stated he suspects CANNON is the same man who was known in Cuba by the name of DUVAL and who was MORGAN's adjutant during the executions per- formed in Cuba.

MM T-1 advised that on August 27, 1962, FRANK FIORINI, an individual active in anti-CASTRO activity, had indicated that he had participated in discussions for the previous three days with the subject and other members connected with the JULIO CARCERAN group. FIORINI had discussed participation in activity relating to the pro- curement of crews for a number of B-26 planes, and it was decided that candidates for these crews were not to be members of the anti-CASTRO Cuban Revolutionary Council.

According to MM T-1, the pilots recruited were to be sent to unnamed Central American bases and targets were to be Guantanamo Naval Base and the City of Santiago de Cuba, or some target in that general vicinity. No specific date was set for this operation, but FIORINI was given the date of August 31, 1962, as a time limit to find crews. FIORINI stated he had offered his services to VIDAL, but was told he could not participate,

On October 22, 1962, MM T-4, who t-s been in- volved in Cuban volutionary activities fo. the past five years, advised that the subject was planning to depart that date for Cuba on a military mission. Ac- cording to MM T-4, VIDAL was accompanied by the American adventurer ROY HARGRAVES. VIDAL allegedly has 15 men in his group and recently visited New York.

On November 19, 1962, MM T-4 advised that VIDAL's friend, ROY HARGRAVES, is a friend of JOHN BONILLA, Consul General of Guatemala, and that both are mutual friends of an old Nicaraguan revolutionist. This Nicaraguan recently hired HARGRAVES to place a fire bomb in an unidentified boat. He is reported to have stated that the Nicaraguan government did not want to sponsor any action against CASTRO, but would confer with BONILLA, who has knowledge of the establishment of an Inter-American Brigade.

On October 29, 1962, MM T-4 advised that the subject was planning a mission to Cuba. The subject recently returned from Cuba, where he claimed to have been on a mission. VIDAL is reported to have said that when they were 35 miles off the Cuban coast, his boat was followed by a Cuban gunboat, and that when they were ten miles off the coast, another gunboat joined in the surveillance. At this point VIDAL returned to Miami. He was reportedly using a borrowed boat and the purpose of the mission was to drop an agent in the Matanzas Province of Cuba,

On November 13, 1962, MM T-4 advised that approxi- mately three weeks previously the subject had departed from

Vaca Key, Marathon, Florida, in a private boat on a trip to Cuba,

21 January 1965

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Yuriy Ivanovic NOSENKO

1. The DDP and Chief, SR met with Ambassador Thompson in his office to advise him of our plans to proceed to hostile interrogation in order to clarify the NOSENKO case. The DDP explained that this was we had reached a firm conclusion late last year that NOSENKO was a provocateur and that hostile interrogation was in order. we decided to review these conclusions with representatives of the FBI. After some considerable delay, a series of meetings was held with the FBI at the level of Deputy Director for Security, Mr. William C. Sullivan. The findings of the FBI, which agreed generally with our own views, were formulated in a letter to the Director signed by John Edgar Hoover. A copy of this memorandum was shown to Ambassador Thompson by the DDP with the comment that the FBI and ourselves do not have a common understanding on the case which was something both the DCI and the Director, FBI, agreed would be necessary.

2. DDP went on to say that we would hope to begin hostile interrogations in the near future but before we did, we wanted to discuss the case with Ambassador Thompson in light of the various contingencies which might arise during the course of these interrogations. DDP felt that it was preferable to advise Ambassador Thompson well in advance of our intentions so that if consultations with the State Department became necessary on a contingency basis, Ambassador Thompson would be in possession of the background. Ambassador Thompson first asked if we were sure that NOSENKO could not escape and turn himself into the Soviet Embassy. We told him that we had established him in a country house with a large security guard which we felt made escape improbable. Ambassador Thompson then asked if there was a possibility that NOSENKO might commit suicide. We said psychiatrists did not believe he was the type to do so and that our security surveillance was such that we were alert to this possibility and would try to prevent it. Ambassador Thompson also wondered if there had been any communications concerning NOSENKO from the

Soviet side. He replied there had been none since the confrontation last year following NOSENKO's arrival in this country. We then mentioned the attempts on several occasions by NOSENKO's wife and mother to contact him through the Embassy in Moscow but added that these attempts ceased in March 1964 and nothing has been heard from them since.

3. Ambassador Thompson then asked if NOSENKO had provided information which would discredit any American officials. We answered in the negative, pointing out that he had reported on former French and Canadian ambassadors. We later qualified the statement on Americans, pointing out that NOSENKO did provide information on a few Americans of lesser rank as well as private citizens.

4. The DDP then noted that after we reached a point of no return in our interrogations, we might decide that NOSENKO would have to be turned back. Ambassador Thompson expressed concern that the Soviets might use this action to discourage defections. We explained that when we came to the point that a turn-back appeared desirable, we would hope that a statement could be made by the U. S. Government which would establish NOSENKO as a provocateur. The DDP then described the AEJOYFUL case in brief terms to Ambassador Thompson, emphasizing the parallel planning and the possibility that a quadripartite statement by the governments might be considered. The DDP did note, however, that AEJOYFUL was in British hands and that they have the major responsibility even though we and other security and intelligence services had agreed on the handling of the case. The DDP then noted that in past cases where we had turned back people with intelligence backgrounds at their own request, the Soviets had not made publicity capital of these actions.

5. The earlier mention of our discussions with the FBI recalled to Ambassador Thompson some of the material on Soviet political issues which he has been receiving recently from the FBI. He commented that it was his very strong impression that the information was being fed to us by the Soviets. He said that it either consisted of information we already knew or that which the Soviets would not object to our having. He asked our views on this. The DDP commented that it was the opinion of several officers in the Clandestine Services that some of these FBI sources were under Soviet control whereas the FBI believed them to be genuine.

6. In summing up our position on the NOSENKO case for Ambassador Thompson, the DDP referred to the kinds of information the Soviets had given up through OSENKO. He made particular reference to the Johnson case and observed that if the Soviets were prepared to provide this kind of build-up to insure the success of NOSENKO's mission, it must then be very important to them. In conclusion, the DDP said that he would send a letter for the record to Mr. Hughes on the topic of NOSENKO to which Ambassador Thompson agreed.
