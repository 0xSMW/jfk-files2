SUBJECT
Operational/CYPOCE/AIRECALEN/FOX
WT Operator Candidate Inside Target Area.
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

Action Required: Request for Headquarters Review of Files - Para 5.

1. In the fall of 1960 AMIRE 1 (Peter J. DI CERVENO)
recruited in Havana a WT operator candidate, whose name he
cannot recall at this time. This candidate was spotted and
first contacted by AMPANIC-1, who passed the lead over to
AMIRE 1. AMPANIC-1 first contacted the candidate on the porch
of the old Mercedes Benz Agency at Palecon and Principe Streets,
and AMIRE 1 then contacted subject in the latter's apartment in
the fourth floor of a building located in the middle of the block on the East Side of Fenocal Avenue (Infanta) Between (Valle
and San Jose Streets. This building had a store in the first
floor, was painted a pinkish beige, and the apartments were
very small (one bedroom and bath, living-dining room combina-
tion and a small kitchen). Subject was at the time working in
a hardware store and living with his wife and a small child.
Subject was about 33 years old, 5'10 tall, 160 lbs., wore thick
glasses, light complexion, light hair, protruding facial features)

2. Subject had experience as a professional WT operator
and worked a clandestine WT set for the Organizacion Autentica
(OA) against the Batista regime. AMPANIC-1 was a member of the
(OA) and spotted subject through a leader of the (OA) for whom
Subject worked in the underground.

3. Subject was trained for a week or so by AMELEN-1 in a
safehouse located at 39 San Rafael Street which had been obtained
for that purpose by APTOX-1. APTOX-1 attended the training
sessions as a lock-out, but neither APTOX-1 nor AMELEN-1 knew
the identity and address of the trainee. Training included the
clandestine operation of a RS-1, the use of signal plans, the use
of pads in coding and decoding, and personal security. Training
was conducted in the fall of 1960 after recruitment of Subject
and with the approval of CO George D. SCOWCROFT, who was AMIRD-1's
CO at the time and to whom full reports were turned in on the

training and the identity of the candidate. Subject was never
activated and was kept on stand-by for possible use at a later
date. For that purpose Bona fides were established by AMIRE 1
and reported to his CO. Subject was not supplied with a WT set
and no signal plans nor pads were issued to him.

4. AIRE 1 recalls Subject was very secure in his clandestine
contacts and operations. Despite established bona fides, AMIRE 1
had considerable trouble in gaining Subject's confidence and
three preliminary contacts were necessary before getting down to
business. Subject was last contacted by AIRE-1 at Subject's
apartment described above, in January or February 1961. At
this time Subject was still willing and ready to work.

5. It is assumed that Headquarters files on the activities of
AMIRD-1, AMCLEN-1 or APTOX-1 will contain copies of the training
reports and information reported by AMIRE 1. We would appreciate
Headquarters assistance in ascertaining Subject's identity and
present whereabouts in order to determine if he could still be
used operationally inside target area. AMPANIC-1 has been
terminated by JMWAVE PA Branch because of weakness in his personal
security, and it is believed best not to contact him on this
matter if possible.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Contact Report, Meeting with AMWHIP-1

DATE : 21 May 1965, 1300-1430 hours

PLACE : National Airport

PRESENT Subject and DiUbaldo as Breitheim

1. On 20 May I phoned Subject and requested that he travel to Washington to discuss the background of his discussions with 
02 (UNSNAFU-19 from which stemmed the suggestion that A-1 supply a French-English-Spanish speaking secretary to 19's mission in Paris. The meeting was quite short for as it turned out, the discussion between Subject and 19 on the topic of secretaries, had taken place in March 1965, and had been little more than a casual sort of thing devoid of any specifics whatever and, in particular, devoid of any commitment by either party to proffer or to accept a profferred body. Nevertheless, Subject felt quite certain that slots would still be open in 19's mission and that a recommendation from him would suffice to effect favorable action by 19.

2. I sketched AMBUNNY's qualifications stressing the fact that she had gone to school in the U. S., had worked here, and had done a hitch as a social secretary for the American Ambassador in La Paz. Subject drew the obvious conclusions that it might be difficult to dummy up AMBUNNY's labenslauf adequately to prevent her from being "discovered" by the Cubans. At any rate, since she was our only candidate, Subject agreed to meet with her in New York so that together they could thresh out the pragmatics of the problem. The meeting was set for 22 May. Al Marin (alias) would participate in this meeting.

-2-

3. For the record, I should like to note that in the two and a half years since I had last seen Subject he had aged over 15 years. When I last saw him he was a round-faced, dark-haired, boyish person and has now been transformed into a very grey, very puffy, 50 year old man though I understand his chronological age is something short of 40. These observations ad nothing to do with anything except they might indicate that Subject is living under a great strain. I derived the impression, which coincides with that I obtained the first time I met with Subject, that he is constitutionally oblique in his approach to matters. He is a very difficult person to corner. I am firmly convinced that to date in this operation, if it may be called that, we have never come close to placing Subject in the corner and that it is high time we do so. I do not imply that he is a man of ill will, rather that instinctively he is a man who slides off problems until such time as he feels he has sufficient evidence or is in the right posture to solve them. I should think it would be our task to exploit these natural capacities while at the same time attempting to assure that Subjects not sliding away from us.
