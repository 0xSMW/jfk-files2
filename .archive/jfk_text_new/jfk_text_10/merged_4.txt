Award for Heroic Action or Acceptance of Hazard: Was act voluntary? Describe why act was outstanding, and if it was more than normally expected. Explain, why, and how. If an aerial or marine operation, describe type and position of craft, crew position of individual, and all unusual circumstances. Indicate results of the act.

Award for Achievement, Service, or Performance: State character of service during period for which recommended. What did the individual do that merits the award? Why was this outstanding when compared to others of like grade and experience in similar positions or circumstances? If appropriate, include production records and assistance rendered by other persons or units. What obstacles were encountered or overcome? Indicate results of achievement, service, or performance. Include reference to Fitness Reports, Letters of Commendation, or other documentation already on file which supports this recommendation.

From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord,
Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy, of the Technical Division,
Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with
various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the
Agency's Audio-cntermeasures Program. They conceived and developed
a unique techr in fluoroscopic scanning which is considered to be
a major breakthrough in the detection of clandestine microphones and
other devices targeted against the Agency. It gives the Agency for
the first time the capability to detect hidden technical listening de-
vices a capability for which the intelligence community has expended
large sums of money to develop in a variety of approaches. This tech--
nique will not only benefit the security of all Agency installations
at home and abroad, but will be of utmost benefit to other agencies
in the community. This technique was met with wide acclaim by the
intelligence community and the Technical Security Countermeasures
Committee.

In experimenting with the X-ray in combination with a fluoroscopic
screen, these men showed this combination had distinct advantages in
terms of time and effort over the considerably more expensive X-ray
film and processor. In further refinement of this technique, they
designed an innovation in the form of a fluoroscopic cloth which has
the distinct advantage of flexibility over the fluorescent screens
currently available on the commercial market.

Fection D Continued
James W. McCord, Jr.

To further enhance the use of this equipment, these
nen developed an inconspicuous, easily transportable package,
consisting of two attache cases which hold the x-ray fluoro-
scopic equipment, wall racks, and motor units. This makes it
possible for an audio-countermeasures team to enter offices,
residences, and safehouses without undue attention.

These men have shown great ingenuity and resourcefulness
in the application and development of this audio-countermeasure.
technique. Through their further efforts in package design they
contributed significantly to the future clandestine use of this
technique on a world-wide basis. This technique provides the
Agency for the first time a procedure through which large in-
terior wall surfaces, room furnishings, and objects can be
rapidly scanned in "real time" in the search for hostile tech-
nical penetrations. This capability will significantly enhance
the security of all Agency installations.

## Memorandum

**TO**: Files (BLS)
**DATE**: 29 January 1964

**FROM**: M. D. Stevens

**SUBJECT**: THE LEE HARVEY OSWALD CASE #351164

1.  According to a newspaper column of "Allen and Scott" in the Chicago American of 6 December 1963, on the OSWALD Case, Abram CHAYES, Legal Officer of the State Department, was one of two persons immediately responsible for OSWALD's being permitted to return to the United States from the Soviet Union in June 1962. The other individual named was Llewellyn THOMPSON, the then Ambassador to Russia. Another said to have been involved in the handling of OSWALD's case was Samuel WISE, Counsel of the American Embassy in Moscow.

2.  Abram CHAYES, #352234, who as of 16 February 1961 was described as "the new Counsel in State", was granted Security approval for liaison contact with J. Foster COLLINS (in the office of the Chief of the Covert Action Staff) on 6 March 1961. The request for CHAYES' clearance was a "Blanket" request to permit discussion with him of NSC 5412/2 matters on a need-to-know basis.

3.  In September 1961 there was a White House namecheck request on CHAYES' wife Antonia (Toni) Leigh CHAYES, nee: HANDLER.

4.  In March 1962, CHAYES was granted a renewal of his liaison contact clearance with C/CA on a continuing basis. This time his contact was Archibald ROOSEVELT, Jr.

5.  On 10 February 1962, HUMAN EVENTS reported as follows with reference to CHAYES:

    "SOFT ON COMMUNISM: Representative Francis E. Walter (R.-Pa.), Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, has scored the new State Department regulations on passports, claiming they would allow Reds denied passports to "rifle freely the confidential files of the FBI, the CIA and other investigative agencies." The man behind the new regulations, which Walter claims violate the Internal Security Act of 1950, is reportedly State's chief legal officer, Abram Chayes. Chayes, a Kennedy appointee, is an ex-Harvard professor who was Chester Bowles' top legal adviser when Bowles was Governor of Connecticut. Walter has introduced legislation to remedy the new passport regulations."

SECRET

6.  Samuel WISE, "Counsel in the American Embassy in Moscow" who is referred to above, may well be Samuel Griffin WISE Jr., #74574, SD & SSD, who apparently was once a contract employee on AEACTIVE. The State Department reviewed WISE's file on 2 June 1954; and as of September 1962 a Samuel G. WISE was Second Secretary of the American Embassy in Moscow. At that time WISE advised in a cable to the State Department that it appeared that Bruce Frederick DAVIS, #352267, who defected from the United States Army in Germany on 18 August 1960, had not expatriated himself. DAVIS' case is very similar to that of OSWALD; and he, like OSWALD, lived in the Soviet Union for two years after his defection and prior to making application for return to the United States.

7.  WISE was an applicant for CIA employment in early 1953 and was security approved subject to polygraph on 11 August 1953. He did not enter on duty and in September 1953 the office which had been interested in him was "no longer interested". On 13 November 1953, WISE was granted a CSA to permit his use as a contract employee on AEACTIVE in New York City. His CSA was cancelled on 24 March 1958.

8.  WISE was named as a friend of William Orville MUNSELL, #61693-DL, during an investigation of the latter for possible CIA employment in 1952. WISE, according to MUNSELL's landlady and social acquaintance in Washington, D.C. during the period of about a year which ended in April 1952, was the only person she knew by name with whom MUNSELL was friendly. According to the informant, WISE was a student at Columbia University whose address was 423 Furnald Hall. MUNSELL was Security disapproved for CIA employment in June 1952 because of his close association on a professional and social basis, while attending Denver University from 1946 to 1951, with persons of questionable loyality. In November 1954, MUNSELL was of interest to project FJALIVE with reference to assignment to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; however, the interested office withdrew their request on him, after Security advised of the derogatory information regarding him.

9.  WISE from 1951 to 1954 attended Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, New York, which was attacked by a Citizen's Group, which alleged Communist influence in the school system. He had several questionable associates in addition to MUNSELL.

Nov. 23 de 1962

La Habana, Noviembre 23 de 1962

Queridos Hnos:

Adjunto enviamos el Estado de Cuentas donde el 19 de Octubre hasta el 23 de No-
viembre. Le haremos algunas explicaciones:

1.- Cuando recibimos los $10,000.00, pagamos el mes de Septiembre (el 19 de Octubre), al
principio dimos la mitad de la ayuda correspondiente a Octubre.

2.- La Sra. de Montoya y Suit son las encargadas de repartir el dinero entre los Familiares
y presos de Jaruco y San Severino respectivamente. Próximamente enviaremos un informe
detallado de esta prisión y de cada giro.

3.- Al Abogado, M. Calas le habían dado 100.00 y faltaban $250.00. Es el encargado de de-
fender al grupo de Pinar del Río y Rafael, Mixtas y Crestes.

4.- Cuando veces tres hombres y $180.00 quiere decir $60.00 para cada uno.

5.- Mongo ha firmado varios vales porque se está encargando de arreglar y recoger los carros.

6.- El traspaso varia de precio según los papeles que se tengan. Casi todos tienen a los due-
ños presos o fuera del territorio Nacional, para no poderles hay que ir por trans.
No es verdaderamente un traspaso si no la inscripción para la nueva chapa y tiene que ser
personalmente.

7.- El cojín fué para la Sra. que vivía en la calle 6 que falleció y es donde duermen los
muchos cuando no tienen donde ir. Esta eames el lugar, pues tuvimos allí una reunión.

8.- El mes de Noviembre fue la ayuda familiar solamente de $20.00 pues no había más. Solo
cuando recibió mas, recibió 2.00, porque la Sra. tuvo un bebito muerto, nacido antes de tiem-
po y estaba ingresada delicada de salud.

9.- Malanga y Fernando reciben el dinero quincenalmente, por eso es que aparecen dos veces
en la lista.

10.- Ninguna familia recibe la cantidad de la madre de Julito, pero esto es provisional, ya q
que el padre está también preso y sin el firma Julia no puede cambiar cheques al sacar
dinero del banco.

11.- Juanoce era el encargado de Finanzas y se entregó $109.00 que era lo que tenía en caja.
Uno de los carros que estaba a su nombre lo tenía que entregar al gobierno porque se em-
barcaba y nos dio $500.00 por el. Aunquo nos tiene que dar más, ya que costo $2,000.00 
$2,500.00, no se han informado aún.

12.- Yo no soy responsable de Finanzas, sólo he aceptado guardar y repartir el dinero provi-
sionalmente hasta que se nombre a alguien definitivamente.

No tenemos que decirte la necesidad que hay de dinero. Ya Luis te habrá explicato acus
está el asunto de la carne, por ejemplo. Para ser hay que comprar en bolsa negra ; si no mori-
rirse de hambre. El pollo está ya a $2.50 la libra en pie, y todo por el estilo. Esto no quiere
decir que empecemos a cazar pollo y no picadillo, pero el asunto es que se puede conseguir uno
y no lo otro.

Te aseguramos que no salgastamos ni un centavo. Si quieres tener más datos de las deudas
saber que con mucho gusto te complaceremos. Hoy en día ni se consigue ni la gente tiene para co-
mer dulces, Acuérdate que ha habido un chote FUESTO y no hay muchas personas en los festi-
vos.

Espero nos escribas aunque sean dos líneas, ya que no se has maniado mas que recibidas con
los muchachos. Dice si ya eres padre, pues nos gusta estar al tanto de los acontecimientos de
nuestra GRAN FAMILIA.

Un abrazo para todas mis sobrinas en ST3.
