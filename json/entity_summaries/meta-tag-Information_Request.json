These requests originate from various government entities, including the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (Church Committee). The requests target organizations like the CIA and FBI, seeking documents and information related to specific individuals, operations, and potential abuses. The process of fulfilling these requests involved determining document release eligibility, redaction requirements, and review restrictions, spanning topics from CIA histories to investigations into figures like Martin Luther King, Jr.",
