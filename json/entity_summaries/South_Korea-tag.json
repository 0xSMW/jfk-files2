The documents reveal that South Korean officials expressed deep sorrow and took immediate steps to honor Kennedy, including flying flags at half-mast and conducting memorial rites in Seoul. High-ranking South Korean officials, including Chairman PAK and Prime Minister KIM (YO'NG CHO'L), traveled to Washington D.C. to attend Kennedy's funeral, with arrangements made for their security and meetings with U.S. officials. The South Korean Ambassador in Washington reported on the positive reactions to the South Korean President's visit to the U.S. following the assassination. Simultaneously, South Korea was preparing for its National Assembly General Elections, raising concerns about potential election violations and political stability. An NSA SIGINT Command Center OPSUM also noted a potential coup in South Korea around the time of the assassination.",
