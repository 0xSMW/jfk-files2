  "summary": "The documents highlight 'Intelligence' primarily in the context of gathering information, conducting covert operations, and assessing threats related to various geopolitical hotspots, particularly Cuba and Vietnam. Intelligence activities include collecting information on individuals, organizations, and events, often involving clandestine operations, surveillance, and the use of agents. The documents reveal intelligence efforts aimed at destabilizing the Cuban government (Operation MONGOOSE), monitoring Soviet and Cuban activities, and assessing political situations in countries like Haiti and Vietnam. The CIA, FBI, and NSA are frequently mentioned as key players in these intelligence operations. The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) is also noted for its role in reviewing and advising on intelligence matters. A recurring theme is the use of intelligence to inform policy decisions and to counter perceived threats from communist and anti-American elements.",

The documents reveal intelligence activities related to Cuba and the Soviet Union, which were key areas of concern during the Kennedy administration. The documents also show intelligence gathering on individuals who had contact with Lee Harvey Oswald. The documents also reveal intelligence gathering on reactions to the assassination from various countries.",
