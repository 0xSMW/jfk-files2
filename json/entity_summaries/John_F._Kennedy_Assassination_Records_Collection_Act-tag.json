  "summary": "The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act is referenced in documents pertaining to the Assassination Records Review Board's (ARRB) decisions regarding the release of HSCA (House Select Committee on Assassinations) staff payroll records. These documents are final determination notifications issued by the ARRB in December 1995. The notifications concern the postponement of releasing specific information, namely Social Security numbers, from the HSCA staff payroll records. This postponement was due to privacy concerns, balancing the public's interest in historical records with the need to protect personal information. The Act mandates the ARRB to review and determine the release of assassination-related documents, and these notifications reflect the ARRB's role in implementing the Act by weighing historical significance against privacy considerations.",
