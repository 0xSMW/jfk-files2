  "summary": "The Chief of Station, JMWAVE, served as the head of the CIA's Miami station, a crucial hub for covert operations against Cuba during the early to mid-1960s. This individual was responsible for overseeing a wide range of activities, including intelligence gathering, agent recruitment and management (e.g., AMFAUNA, AMSPELL, AMWORLD), propaganda efforts, and exfiltration attempts. The Chief of Station communicated regularly with CIA headquarters and other entities like Task Force W, providing progress reports, operational reviews, and requests for support. They also managed the financial and administrative aspects of JMWAVE's operations, including agent compensation and budget allocations. The documents reveal a focus on infiltrating agents into Cuba, gathering intelligence on anti-Castro groups, and influencing public opinion through media contacts.",
