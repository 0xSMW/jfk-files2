  "summary": "Visa requests appear in multiple contexts within the JFK assassination-related documents. One instance involves Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov, a figure suspected of involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald's visa request while Kostikov was stationed in Mexico City. Another document concerns a visa request for Silvia Anna, highlighting the urgency and potential logistical challenges in processing it between Mexico City and Havana. A third document details visa requests from Cubans seeking to discuss anti-Castro support, indicating the political sensitivities surrounding visa issuance during this period. These instances collectively suggest that visa requests were a point of interest and potential concern, particularly when involving individuals or groups with suspected connections to intelligence activities or political movements relevant to the Cold War context.",
