  "summary": "Key West appears in these documents primarily as a location associated with CIA operations and Cuban exile activities. It served as a departure point for the TEJANA vessel involved in Operation JEAN, a classified mission to infiltrate cargo and personnel into an unspecified location in February 1961. Additionally, Key West is mentioned in connection with U.S. aircraft exercises near Cuba in November 1963, following President Kennedy's death, indicating its strategic importance for monitoring Cuban military activities. The documents also suggest Key West's proximity to Miami, where Cuban exile groups like Cuban Power and MIRR were active, although Key West's direct involvement in these groups' activities is not explicitly stated.",
