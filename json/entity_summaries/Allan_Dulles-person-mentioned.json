  "summary": "Allan Dulles is mentioned in the context of NSA and Senate Select Committee investigations into the JFK assassination. While the documents do not directly detail Dulles's involvement, they arise from inquiries and reviews conducted by the NSA and Senate Select Committee concerning the Warren Commission's findings. The documents primarily focus on the NSA's role in providing information to the Warren Commission, reviewing exhibits, and investigating potential Cuban involvement. Mentions of Dulles appear indirectly, as the documents discuss the NSA's responses to queries about the Warren Commission, which Dulles was a part of. The documents also cover NSA's analysis of Cuban communications and military alerts following the assassination, and the agency's efforts to locate relevant information within its files. Russell August Langelle mentions his CIA career, which may indirectly connect to Dulles through the CIA's involvement in the JFK assassination context.",
