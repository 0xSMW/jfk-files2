  "summary": "The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC), also known as the Church Committee, was a U.S. Senate committee established in 1975 to investigate intelligence activities of the U.S. government. The documents indicate the SSC was actively investigating the FBI and CIA, including their involvement in questionable activities and projects like ZRRIFLE. The SSC requested and received information from these agencies, reviewed documents, and conducted inquiries into various intelligence operations. The documents highlight the SSC's focus on potential abuses of power and the need for oversight of intelligence agencies. The committee's work involved reviewing sensitive information, coordinating with agencies like the FBI and CIA, and addressing concerns about the declassification and release of information.",

  "significance": "While the documents provided do not directly link the SSC to the JFK assassination, the SSC's investigation into intelligence agencies and their activities could potentially uncover information relevant to the assassination, depending on the scope and findings of their inquiries into the FBI and CIA. The documents suggest the SSC was focused on investigating potential abuses of power and illegal activities by these agencies, which could indirectly relate to the JFK assassination if those activities were connected.",
