  "significance": "While the documents themselves do not directly mention the JFK assassination, the concept of 'Operational Use' is significant in the context of the JFK assassination because it relates to how the CIA might have utilized individuals and resources in covert operations. Understanding the CIA's policies and restrictions on operational use can provide insights into the types of activities the agency might have been involved in, and the potential involvement of non-staff personnel in events surrounding the assassination. The restrictions on certain categories of individuals also highlight the agency's concerns about potential conflicts of interest or security risks.",
