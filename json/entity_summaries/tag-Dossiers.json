The system allows for the identification, control, and filing of information on persons of interest, as well as generating lists of these personalities based on various categories. The documents do not explicitly link the 201 system or the dossiers to the JFK assassination, but they highlight a system for tracking individuals of interest, which could potentially include persons related to the assassination.",
