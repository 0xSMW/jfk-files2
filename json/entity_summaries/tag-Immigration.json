  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, immigration serves as a backdrop for understanding the movement and backgrounds of individuals who may have been of interest to intelligence agencies. The documents suggest that immigration status and travel history were considered relevant factors in assessing potential security risks or connections to foreign entities, which could be pertinent to investigations involving foreign influence or potential threats to national security. However, the documents do not directly link immigration to the JFK assassination.",
