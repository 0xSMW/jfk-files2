  "summary": "Chief of Station JMWAVE was the head of the CIA's JMWAVE station in Miami, Florida, a crucial hub for covert operations targeting Cuba during the early to mid-1960s. JMWAVE's activities encompassed a wide range of intelligence and operational tasks, including training and managing Cuban exile agents (e.g., AMFAUNA, AMSPELL, AMWORLD), gathering intelligence on Cuban military activities and Soviet presence, planning infiltration missions, and coordinating the shipment of supplies and communications. The station communicated regularly with CIA headquarters, providing updates, requesting resources, and seeking guidance on sensitive operational matters related to projects such as AMTRUNK and GYROSE. JMWAVE also monitored potential security breaches and managed relationships with media contacts. The station's activities spanned from 1961 to 1968, with a concentration in the early to mid-1960s.",
