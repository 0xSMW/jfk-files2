The documents also highlight concerns within the CIA regarding the release of information by the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), particularly concerning the potential exposure of undeclared officers, activities in France, and the existence of CIA stations in locations like Tokyo. The CIA was actively trying to manage the release of information to protect ongoing operations and relationships with foreign governments.",
