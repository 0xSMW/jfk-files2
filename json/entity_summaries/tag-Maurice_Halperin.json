He is connected to investigations into American Communists in Mexico. By 1962, he was residing in Cuba, as indicated by a Christmas card sent from him. His file was reviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA).",

His alleged ties to Soviet espionage and activities in Mexico, along with his association with individuals of interest, made him a subject of interest to the HSCA.",
