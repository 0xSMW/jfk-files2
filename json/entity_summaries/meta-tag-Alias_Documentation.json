  "summary": "Alias documentation, including the creation and management of false identities and supporting documents, was a critical aspect of CIA operations from the early 1960s to the late 1990s. These aliases, along with cryptonyms and pseudonyms, were used to protect the identities of CIA personnel, assets, and individuals involved in sensitive operations, particularly those related to Cuban activities and Project ZRRIFLE. The CIA used aliases for various operational purposes, including travel, recruitment, and maintaining cover, often utilizing forged documents. The release of alias documentation within the JFK assassination records was a point of contention between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), reflecting the CIA's concern over protecting covert actions, intelligence collection methods, and the identities of individuals involved in clandestine activities.",
