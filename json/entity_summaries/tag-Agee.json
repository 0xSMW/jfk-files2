  "summary": "The documents refer to an individual named Agee, who was involved with the Mexico City Station. Charlotte Z. Bustos-Videla was interviewed regarding her acquaintance with Agee, but she offered no additional information. Elsie L. Scaletti recalls Agee's limited involvement with Cuban operations at the Mexico City Station and recounts informing the new COS, John A. Probert, about Agee's resignation under a cloud. The documents also mention Agee in the context of David Phillips' manuscript, which was deemed undesirable due to disclosures of sources, methods, cover arrangements, and liaison relationships.",
