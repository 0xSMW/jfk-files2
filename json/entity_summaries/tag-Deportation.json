  "summary": "The documents highlight deportation as a significant action taken against individuals of interest to U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Specifically, Samuel M. Giancana was deported from Mexico in 1974, involving coordination between the FBI, CIA, and Mexican officials. Santo Trafficante Jr.'s potential deportation from Cuba was considered in 1959, with observations made regarding his activities and associates. Additionally, the handling of defectors, such as Boroslaw Borowies, involved immigration and resettlement issues, touching upon deportation-related concerns. These instances suggest that deportation was a tool used to manage individuals deemed problematic or connected to criminal activities, and in the case of defectors, to navigate complex international relations and security concerns.",

  "significance": "While the documents directly mention deportation in the context of individuals like Giancana and Trafficante, their potential roles in the JFK assassination are not explicitly detailed within these documents. The significance lies in the fact that these individuals, who were subjects of deportation proceedings, were also figures of interest in organized crime investigations, which have been linked to various JFK assassination conspiracy theories. The documents suggest that deportation was a tool used against individuals who may have been involved in activities that could have had implications for national security or criminal enterprises.",
