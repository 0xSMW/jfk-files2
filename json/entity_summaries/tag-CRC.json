  "summary": "The Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) was formed in 1961 under the guidance of the U.S. Government to unify Cuban exile groups. The CRC aimed to coordinate efforts against the Cuban government. The documents reveal that the CRC had internal issues and faced challenges in coordinating with the CIA. Dr. Miro, the head of the CRC, expressed frustration over the lack of support and coordination from the CIA, the independent operations of the Agency in Cuba, and the failure to resolve key issues such as providing arms, funds, and a unified plan of action for the underground resistance. The CRC was involved in various operations, including FI-CI activity, propaganda efforts, political action, paramilitary activities, training, and communications. The documents also mention financial obligations and personnel actions related to the CRC.",
