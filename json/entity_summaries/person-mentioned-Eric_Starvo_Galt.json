  "significance": "While the documents primarily relate to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., one document mentions investigations into the assassinations of both Martin Luther King Jr. and President John F. Kennedy, placing Eric Starvo Galt (James Earl Ray) tangentially within the broader context of assassination investigations during that period. However, the documents do not directly implicate Galt/Ray in the JFK assassination.",
