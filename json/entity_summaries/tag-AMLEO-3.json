  "summary": "AMLEO-3 refers to Jose Ricardo RABEL Nunez, an individual assessed by the CIA for potential dual loyalties to both the CIA and Fidel Castro. He was involved in the AMTRUNK Operation. In May 1964, AMLEO-3 sponsored an unsuccessful exfiltration attempt via M/V ADA to rescue his family from Cuba. In September 1965, his arrest was a subject of discussion involving Dick Philips from the State Department, with background information provided on Mitchell L. WER-BELL and the circumstances surrounding the arrest of AMLEO-3 and his associates. The documents suggest scrutiny of AMLEO-3's background and activities, particularly regarding his potential connections to Cuba and his involvement in covert operations.",
