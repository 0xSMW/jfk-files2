  "summary": "Salvador Allende was the President of Chile. The documents reference him primarily in the context of covert actions and political operations in Chile, particularly around the time of his overthrow. These operations include CIA support in Chile prior to his overthrow, psychological operations following his ouster aimed at managing the narrative around the Chilean Junta, and concerns about individuals' views on the circumstances of his removal from power. The documents suggest that the CIA was involved in activities related to Chile during Allende's presidency and after his removal.",
