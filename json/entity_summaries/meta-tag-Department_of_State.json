  "summary": "The Department of State (DOS), also referred to as the State Department, is a U.S. government entity deeply involved in foreign policy, national security, and intelligence matters. The documents reveal its coordination with agencies like the CIA, FBI, Department of Defense, and USIA on various issues, including efforts to counter Cuban subversion in Latin America, monitor Cuban exiles, and handle the return of Lee Harvey Oswald from the Soviet Union. The DOS provided official cover for CIA employees and participated in visa authorizations and diplomatic demarches. It also played a role in providing information to the Warren Commission and evaluating international situations, such as those in Southeast Asia. Some documents highlight instances where the DOS's actions or information conflicted with other agencies, necessitating clarification and coordination.",
