  "summary": "Henri Curiel is mentioned in the documents as providing support to Black Panther members in Paris. Specifically, he is reported to be assisting members, including George Edward Wright, who arrived from Algiers, by providing resources through his organization to obtain plastic surgery and false documentation for re-entry into the U.S. This activity is documented in a CIA message from July 1973. The other documents mention Black militants/hijackers moving from Algeria to France and Switzerland, and a memorandum details alleged connections between the CIA, Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation, and individuals linked to Soviet agents, but Curiel's direct involvement in these matters is not specified beyond his support for the Black Panthers in Paris.",
