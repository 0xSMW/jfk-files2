  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, there is no direct mention of Thomas H. Downing in the context of the JFK assassination or related investigations. The documents primarily consist of administrative records from the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) concerning the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) staff payroll. These records detail employee payroll authorizations, salary adjustments, and the postponement of Social Security numbers for privacy reasons. The documents cover various HSCA staff members and their employment details during the late 1970s, with subsequent reviews and notifications occurring in the 1990s. The focus is on administrative and personnel matters within the HSCA.",

  "significance": "Low. While Thomas H. Downing is mentioned in 43 documents, the summaries indicate that the documents primarily concern administrative matters related to HSCA payroll and privacy, with no direct connection to Downing's role or involvement in the JFK assassination investigation itself.",
