  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Walter P. Haltigan is a person of interest to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), as indicated by a memorandum detailing the HSCA's request for depositions and interviews of specific individuals within the CIA. The documents also address allegations that the CIA interviewed Lee Harvey Oswald upon his return from the Soviet Union and details the Agency's consistent denial of any contact with Oswald. The report examines the House Select Committee on Assassinations' (HSCA) investigation into whether the CIA routinely debriefed returning American defectors and reviews files of individuals who traveled to the USSR between 1958 and 1963. The documents suggest that Haltigan may have been a CIA officer or employee whose potential involvement or knowledge was relevant to the HSCA's investigation into the JFK assassination, specifically concerning the CIA's interactions with individuals who had contact with the Soviet Union. However, the precise nature of his role or knowledge is not explicitly detailed in these summaries.",
