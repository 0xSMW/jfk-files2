  "summary": "The documents provided mention the \"New Left\" in the context of FBI investigations and surveillance during the 1960s and 1970s. Specifically, the FBI sought authorization for telephone surveillances on organizations associated with the New Left, such as Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). These surveillances were justified based on alleged extremist activities and potential threats to national security. The documents also reference Cointelpro actions against various groups, including those associated with the New Left. The documents suggest that the FBI was actively monitoring and investigating groups associated with the New Left due to concerns about their political activities and potential for disruption.",
