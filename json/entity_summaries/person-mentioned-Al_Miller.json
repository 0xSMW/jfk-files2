Sentinella testified before the Senate Select Committee (SSC) on May 21, 1975, regarding investigations into Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison. His testimony covered topics such as electronic surveillance and potential communist influence related to these individuals and organizations. The documents consistently summarize his testimony before the SSC on the same date, focusing on the same subjects.",
