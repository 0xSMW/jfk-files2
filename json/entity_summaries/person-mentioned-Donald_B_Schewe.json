  "summary": "Donald B. Schewe is mentioned in a series of FBI documents from April and May 1975 related to the Senate Select Committee (SSC) investigation into intelligence activities. The documents primarily concern the FBI's response to the SSC's inquiries, including the provision of materials, monitoring of former agents and potential witnesses, and internal discussions regarding policies, procedures, and personnel. While the documents indicate Schewe's involvement in these internal FBI processes related to the SSC investigation, the specific nature of his role or responsibilities is not detailed. There is no direct mention of the JFK assassination in relation to Schewe within these documents; his involvement appears to be solely in the context of the later investigation into intelligence activities.",
