  "summary": "Surreptitious entry, in the context of these documents, refers to covert operations involving unauthorized access to premises, specifically mentioned in relation to a request from the CIA to surreptitiously enter the Chilean Embassy in Washington, D.C. This action is discussed within the broader context of inquiries about the FBI's legal attaches and CIA's technical developments shared with the FBI. The documents also touch upon the FBI's response to Senate Select Committee inquiries regarding former employees and Cointelpro activities, as well as CIA activities involving Robert Maheu and surveillance activities. The mention of surreptitious entry highlights concerns about potential abuses of power and violations of sovereignty by intelligence agencies.",

This context is important for understanding the broader environment in which the JFK assassination occurred and the potential for covert operations to be conducted without oversight.",
