Haltigan is a person of interest to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), as indicated by a memorandum detailing the HSCA's request for depositions and interviews of specific individuals within the CIA. The documents suggest that the HSCA was investigating potential CIA connections to Lee Harvey Oswald and the possibility of CIA involvement or knowledge related to Oswald's activities, including his time in the Soviet Union.
