These documents span from 1960 to 1968 and include details about his debriefing after a trip to Cuba, his bank account information for operational advances and salary payments, and amendments to his CIA contract, including compensation and termination settlements. He appears to have been involved in operational deployments and cover arrangements, potentially through proprietary companies. His debriefing memorandum suggests he had observations and suggestions regarding Fidel Castro and potential contacts of influence in Cuba.",
