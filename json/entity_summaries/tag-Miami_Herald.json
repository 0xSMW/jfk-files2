  "summary": "The Miami Herald is a newspaper that appears in several CIA documents related to JMWAVE operations. The documents reveal that the CIA, through JMWAVE, had a relationship with at least one journalist (AMCARBON-1) at the Miami Herald. This journalist provided operational support, intelligence, and served as a propaganda outlet for the CIA from December 1962 to March 1964. The CIA also monitored and responded to articles published in the Miami Herald concerning Cuban exile leadership, specifically regarding the replacement of Miro Cardona by Manuel Ray in May 1962, allegedly with U.S. backing. The CIA sought to discredit stories it deemed unfavorable and reassure individuals mentioned in the articles.",
