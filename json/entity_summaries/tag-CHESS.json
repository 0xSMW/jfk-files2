The term \"CHESS\" is not explicitly defined within these documents, but the context suggests it is likely a code name or operation related to intelligence collection and analysis of Soviet capabilities. The documents detail missions penetrating the Soviet Bloc air defense system, analysis of Soviet radar coverage and response strategies, and the effectiveness of their warning systems based on COMINT and ELINT data. One document also mentions a request from the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) for information on the U-2 Project, indicating a potential connection to historical investigations, although the direct relevance to the JFK assassination is not explicitly stated in these documents.",
