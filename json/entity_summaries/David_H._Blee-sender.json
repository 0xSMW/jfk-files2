These letters detail Kostikov's activities, including his assignment in Mexico City, his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald's visa request, and suspected involvement with Central American communist parties. Blee also authored a memorandum dated October 24, 1975, discussing CIA's interactions with the FBI regarding the James Earl Ray case, emphasizing that CIA actions were undertaken at the FBI's request and detailing efforts to gather information on Ray's aliases and whereabouts through overseas liaison services.
