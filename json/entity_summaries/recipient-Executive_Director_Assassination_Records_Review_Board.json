  "summary": "The Executive Director of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) is the recipient of several memoranda from the CIA regarding the release of information related to the JFK assassination. These documents highlight the CIA's concerns about releasing certain types of information, including the identities of human intelligence sources, details about the Warrenton Training Center (WTC), alias documentation, accommodation addresses, and information about the CIA's commercial cover program. The CIA sought to protect national security, intelligence operations, and diplomatic relations by proposing substitutions for true names, postponing the release of certain records, and answering questions about the cover program. The ARRB's role is to review and decide on the release of these records, balancing transparency with potential risks.",
