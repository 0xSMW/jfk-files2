  "significance": "The Califano Papers are significant in the JFK context as they provide insight into the U.S. government's concerns and actions regarding Cuban subversion in Latin America during the early 1960s. While the documents themselves do not directly mention the JFK assassination, they illuminate the political climate and the U.S. government's focus on Cuba, which is relevant given the various theories linking Cuba to the assassination.",
