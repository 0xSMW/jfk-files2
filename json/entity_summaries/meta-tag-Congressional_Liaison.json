  "summary": "The Congressional Liaison, primarily through the CIA's Office of Legislative Counsel, is responsible for managing the CIA's interactions with the U.S. Congress, including both the House and Senate. This involves responding to inquiries from congressional committees and individual members, arranging briefings, and facilitating access to information, often sensitive in nature. A significant aspect of this role, as highlighted in the documents, pertains to managing congressional requests and access related to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigation into the JFK assassination. The Office of Legislative Counsel navigated these requests while safeguarding classified information and protecting the identities of agency personnel, demonstrating the crucial role of the Congressional Liaison in maintaining transparency while protecting sensitive intelligence matters.",
