  "summary": "OXCART is mentioned in the context of intelligence activities reviewed by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). Specifically, it appears in the minutes from a June 1963 meeting, indicating it was an active program or project at that time. The documents suggest OXCART was related to advanced intelligence collection capabilities and was significant enough to warrant updates to the PFIAB. While the documents do not explicitly detail the nature of OXCART, its inclusion in discussions involving CIA operations and advanced intelligence suggests it was a significant intelligence-gathering asset or program. The documents do not directly link OXCART to the JFK assassination, but its presence in discussions about intelligence activities during the period is notable.",
