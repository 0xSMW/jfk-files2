  "summary": "The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) was a committee formed to investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The CIA provided materials to the HSCA for review at CIA headquarters. The HSCA investigated allegations of CIA involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald, including claims that Oswald was a CIA agent in Tokyo and that the CIA interviewed him upon his return from the Soviet Union. The CIA consistently denied any contact with Oswald. The HSCA also examined whether the CIA routinely debriefed returning American defectors, reviewing files of individuals who traveled to the USSR between 1958 and 1963. The HSCA's investigation spanned from September 1976 to June 1978, involving meetings, requests for information, and correspondence between the HSCA and the CIA.",
