  "summary": "The documents reference various military activities, primarily focusing on Cuban military movements and alerts in the context of the Cold War and events surrounding President Kennedy's assassination. These activities include tracked tank movements, ship arrivals from the USSR, naval alerts, and the fleeing of Cuban naval officers. Furthermore, military units in Latin American countries were placed on alert following a subversive operation in Venezuela. The activities of Cuban exile groups, such as the MRR led by Manuel Artime, involving training camps and raids on Cuba, also fall under this category. These activities reflect the heightened state of alert and tension during this period.",
