These documents detail her employment history, including her position, annual salary, and gross pay for various accounting periods. The Assassination Records Review Board also issued a notification regarding the postponed release of her Social Security number from HSCA staff payroll records, indicating the existence of payroll authorization forms detailing her employment history with the Select Committee on Assassinations.

  "significance": "Jacqueline Hess's significance lies in her employment with the HSCA, the committee tasked with investigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. While the documents do not specify her exact role within the committee, her presence on payroll records and certification reports indicates she was a staff member involved in the committee's operations. The withholding of her Social Security number by the Assassination Records Review Board suggests that her employment records were considered sensitive or potentially relevant to the investigation.",
