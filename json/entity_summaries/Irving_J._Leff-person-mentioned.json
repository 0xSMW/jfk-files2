  "summary": "Irving J. Leff is mentioned in several FBI teletypes from late 1962 related to the activities of John Rosselli in Los Angeles. He appears to be an associate of Rosselli, as he is mentioned in connection with Rosselli's presence at the Friar-s Club and in meetings. The documents suggest that Leff was part of Rosselli's social circle during this period. There is no direct indication in these documents that Leff was involved in the JFK assassination, but his association with Rosselli, who has been linked to organized crime and potential involvement in plots against Fidel Castro, places him within a network of individuals who have been of interest to investigators.",
