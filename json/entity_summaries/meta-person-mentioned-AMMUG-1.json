  "summary": "AMMUG-1, also known as AMMUG/1, was a CIA agent active in Mexico City between 1964 and 1966. In 1964, the CIA sought a safehouse for AMMUG-1 in Mexico City, ultimately choosing an apartment despite concerns about its location. Later documents detail AMMUG/1's cover employment with the Inter-University Committee for Political and Social Action (ICPSA), including issues related to taxes and his WOFACT future. AMMUG/1's attempt to purchase a house was deferred. He was also unable to identify Manuel ESTEVEZ Perez when queried, leading to a suggestion to provide a photograph for identification in Barcelona.",
