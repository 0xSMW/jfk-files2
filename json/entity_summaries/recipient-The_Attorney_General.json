  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, the Attorney General is mentioned as the recipient of information regarding the FBI's response to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC).

The Attorney General's role appears to be one of oversight or awareness regarding the FBI's interactions with the Senate Committee.

  "significance": "The Attorney General's significance in the JFK context, based solely on these documents, is indirect. The documents focus on the FBI's response to the SSC's requests for information related to Martin Luther King, Jr., and the SCLC. The Attorney General's role appears to be that of an informed party regarding the FBI's activities and responses to the Senate Committee, rather than a direct actor in events related to the JFK assassination. Without additional context, it's difficult to ascertain a more specific significance.",
