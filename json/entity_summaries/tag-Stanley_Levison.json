  "summary": "Stanley Levison was a key figure investigated by the FBI due to his close association with Martin Luther King Jr. and alleged ties to the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). The FBI's interest in Levison stemmed from concerns about potential communist influence within the Civil Rights Movement, particularly through King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Multiple documents summarize testimonies and FBI investigations focusing on Levison's alleged secret CPUSA membership and his relationship with King. The FBI provided information to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) regarding Levison's connections, including materials from informants and electronic surveillance. The investigations into Levison occurred primarily between 1962 and 1975, as detailed in the documents provided to the SSC.",
