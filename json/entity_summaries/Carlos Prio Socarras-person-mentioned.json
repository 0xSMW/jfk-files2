  "summary": "Carlos Prio Socarras was a Cuban politician and former President of Cuba. The CIA conducted a financial investigation into him, focusing on his bank accounts, currency exchanges, and suspected foreign investments, with concerns about potential political activities against the Batista regime in Cuba. He appears in documents related to anti-Castro activities and investigations into suspected Castro agents. While the documents do not directly link him to the JFK assassination, his involvement in Cuban politics and potential opposition to the Castro regime place him within the broader context of Cuban-related activities that were of interest to U.S. intelligence agencies during that period.",

While not directly implicated in the assassination, his position as a former Cuban president and his potential opposition to Castro place him within the network of individuals and groups whose activities were of interest to U.S. intelligence agencies during the time of the assassination.",
