  "summary": "Ghana, under President Kwame Nkrumah, appears in these documents primarily in the context of President Kennedy's assassination and related events. Ghana sent condolences and representation to Kennedy's funeral, with the Ghanaian Embassy advising Accra to send a high-prestige delegation to strengthen relations. The documents also mention an African student protest in Moscow following the alleged killing of a Ghanaian student, which was suggested to be used to highlight racist attitudes and Soviet subversion in Africa. There is also a message relaying Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy's appreciation to Kwame Nkrumah for his message of condolence and representation at President Kennedy's funeral, as conveyed through Kwesi Armah.",
