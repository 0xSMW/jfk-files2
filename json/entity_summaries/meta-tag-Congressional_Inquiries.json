  "summary": "Congressional Inquiries, particularly those conducted by committees like the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) and the Church Committee in the mid-1970s, involved extensive scrutiny of intelligence agencies such as the FBI, CIA, and NSA. These inquiries focused on sensitive topics including covert actions, assassinations, the Phoenix program, the Warren Commission, the CIA's budget, the Watergate scandal, COINTELPRO, and the use of media and academics. The documents reveal efforts by intelligence agencies to manage information disclosure, coordinate responses, and address concerns raised by Congress regarding oversight, accountability, and potential legislative reforms.",
