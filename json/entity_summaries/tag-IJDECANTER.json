  "summary": "IJDECANTER is a cryptonym that the CIA sought to protect from release in JFK assassination records. The CIA argued that disclosing IJDECANTER would benefit Russian counterintelligence and damage U.S. intelligence interests. The ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board) was involved in discussions with the CIA regarding the release of information related to the JFK assassination, including the handling of cryptonyms like IJDECANTER. The protection of IJDECANTER was part of a broader effort to manage the release of sensitive information, including pseudonyms, file numbers, and employee names, while balancing transparency with national security concerns.",
