  "summary": "John B. Hotis is identified as being involved in the FBI's interactions with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) in 1975, particularly concerning the FBI's domestic intelligence investigations. His role appears to be related to providing legal counsel or advice, specifically regarding the FBI's responses to the SSC's requests for documents and information. These requests included materials related to Martin Luther King, Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and alleged Communist ties involving Stanley Levison. The documents suggest Hotis was involved in discussions surrounding potential legislative actions, oversight mechanisms, and reforms concerning the FBI's authority and activities.",
