  "summary": "The documents reflect a consistent concern for protecting classified and sensitive information by the CIA, NSA, and other government entities, spanning from the 1950s to the late 1990s. This includes maintaining secrecy around intelligence operations, sources, and methods, particularly in the context of the JFK assassination records, covert operations, and interactions with congressional committees and foreign intelligence services. Secrecy Agreements were used to manage the risk of disclosure, and classifications such as 'Top Secret' and markings like 'NOFORN' were applied to restrict access to sensitive information. The protection of this information was balanced against the need for transparency and cooperation with oversight bodies, while also preventing unauthorized disclosures by former employees and managing internal document handling procedures.",
