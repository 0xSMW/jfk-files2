However, the documents provide insight into CIA operations, anti-Castro activities, and political unrest during the Cold War era, which are relevant to the broader historical context surrounding the assassination. The arrests of individuals involved in these activities could potentially have indirect connections to the events and investigations related to the JFK assassination.",
