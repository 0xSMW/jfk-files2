  "significance": "While the documents do not explicitly link these investigations to the JFK assassination, the presence of these types of investigations within the broader collection of documents related to the assassination suggests that individuals with potential connections to the DOD or government service were being scrutinized during this period. The significance lies in the potential for these investigations to uncover information relevant to the assassination or related events, or to identify individuals who may have played a role in the events surrounding the assassination.",
