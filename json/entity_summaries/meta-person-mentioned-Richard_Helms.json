  "summary": "Richard Helms was a central figure within the CIA, eventually serving as its Director, and is mentioned in 104 documents related to CIA activities, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s. He was involved in sensitive matters including covert actions discussed by the PFIAB Covert Action Panel in 1964, such as activities in Chile, Vietnam, and Cuba (including Operation MONGOOSE and potential assassination plots against Fidel Castro). Helms also appears in connection with internal CIA investigations, such as the E. Howard Hunt investigation and the Yurily Ivanovich Nosenko case, as well as the JFK assassination records, including discussions with the Warren Commission and the declassification of documents. His awareness of CIA mail opening projects is also noted. His activities were scrutinized by committees like the Rockefeller Commission and the Church Committee.",
