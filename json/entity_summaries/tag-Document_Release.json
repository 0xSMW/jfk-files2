  "summary": "Document Release, as a tag, encompasses various aspects of making documents public, particularly within the context of investigations and historical inquiries such as the JFK assassination records. The documents highlight the processes involved in determining which information can be released, the challenges in balancing transparency with national security or privacy concerns, and the coordination required with other agencies, both domestic and international. This includes navigating FOIA requests, addressing concerns from foreign intelligence services (like the British SIS), and managing the notification of individuals whose names appear in potentially releasable documents. The documents also reveal the existence of internal discussions and meetings concerning the management and potential impact of document releases.",
