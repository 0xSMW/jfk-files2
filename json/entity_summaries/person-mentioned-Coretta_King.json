  "summary": "Coretta Scott King was the wife of Martin Luther King Jr. and a prominent civil rights activist in her own right. The documents indicate her connection to the Australian Vietnam Moratorium Campaign in 1970, where the CIA sought information from the FBI regarding her intention to participate. While the documents primarily focus on investigations into Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison, Coretta King's name appears in the context of monitoring individuals involved in anti-war activities. The documents suggest that the FBI and CIA were interested in tracking her activities and associations during this period.",

The documents highlight the government's interest in monitoring individuals associated with civil rights and anti-war activism, suggesting a broader surveillance effort during that era.",
