  "summary": "Manolo Ray (also known as Manuel Ray) was a prominent Cuban exile leader and head of the People's Revolutionary Movement (MRP). He advocated for internal resistance within Cuba, supported by funds and trained exiles, as the preferred method to overthrow Fidel Castro, opposing a direct U.S. invasion. Documents suggest he replaced Miro Cardona as the leader of Cuban exiles, potentially with U.S. backing, sparking controversy within the Cuban community. CIA documents from 1960 to 1978 detail interactions with Ray, assessments of his anti-Castro activities, and his relationships with other exile figures and organizations.",
