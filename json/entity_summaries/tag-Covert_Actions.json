  "summary": "The documents reference \"covert actions\" primarily in the context of ongoing discussions between the CIA and the ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board) regarding the declassification and release of JFK assassination-related records. The CIA is concerned with protecting sensitive information related to these covert actions, particularly unacknowledged ones, and is negotiating with the ARRB to find compromises that allow for the release of information while safeguarding agency equities and operational details. The documents do not specify the nature of these covert actions, but their sensitivity is highlighted by the CIA's efforts to protect them during the declassification process. The ARRB is pushing for transparency and the release of relevant information, leading to negotiations and proposed compromises.",
