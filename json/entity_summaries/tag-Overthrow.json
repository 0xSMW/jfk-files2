The documents highlight the involvement of the CIA (KUBARK) in some of these activities.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the \"Overthrow\" tag is significant because it highlights the CIA's involvement in regime change operations and plots against foreign leaders. While none of the documents directly mention JFK or his assassination, they provide context for understanding the political climate and the types of covert operations the CIA was involved in during that era. This context may be relevant for understanding potential motivations or connections to other events surrounding the assassination.",
