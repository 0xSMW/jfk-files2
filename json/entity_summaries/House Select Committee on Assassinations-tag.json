Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The documents reveal the HSCA's interactions with various government agencies, particularly the CIA, including requests for information, interviews with personnel, and access to classified files. The CIA provided guidelines for cooperation with the HSCA, emphasizing the protection of sources and operational security. The documents also include payroll records of HSCA staff, indicating the committee's operational timeline and personnel. The HSCA's investigation involved reviewing documents related to individuals and organizations potentially connected to the assassinations, such as Virginius Frank Coe, Permindex Corporation, and individuals with ties to Soviet intelligence. The committee's work also involved addressing concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive information and the need to balance transparency with national security interests.",
