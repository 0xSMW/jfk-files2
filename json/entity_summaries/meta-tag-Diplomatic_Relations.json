  "summary": "Following President Kennedy's assassination, diplomatic relations played a crucial role in managing international reactions and potential shifts in foreign policy. Numerous countries conveyed condolences and dispatched representatives to the funeral, adhering to diplomatic protocols. The documents reveal diplomatic communications from various heads of state and instructions to ambassadors. Diplomatic efforts were also focused on navigating potential tensions and shifts in relations with countries like Cuba, Cambodia, and South Vietnam. Assessments of the Johnson administration by foreign governments and discussions surrounding the Warren Commission's findings further underscore the importance of diplomatic activity during this period.",
