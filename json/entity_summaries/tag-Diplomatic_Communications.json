  "summary": "Diplomatic communications, as a tag, refers to the exchange of information and messages between nations, particularly relevant in the context of the JFK assassination due to the Cold War tensions and the involvement of countries like Cuba, Mexico, and Poland. These communications provide insights into the reactions, concerns, and interpretations of various nations following Kennedy's death. Specifically, the documents highlight Cuban military alerts, Cuban diplomatic reactions, and Polish intelligence assessments of UN proceedings honoring Kennedy, including interpretations of Stevenson's comments and concerns about future U.S. foreign policy. The timeline is concentrated around the immediate aftermath of the assassination (November-December 1963) and later investigations (1998). A notable pattern is the focus on interpreting the political implications and potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy following Kennedy's death, as perceived by other nations.",
