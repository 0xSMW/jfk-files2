The documents also suggest a period of political instability and election preparations in South Korea concurrent with the assassination, raising potential concerns about the country's internal affairs during this sensitive time. The presence of South Korean officials at the funeral and their interactions with U.S. leaders highlight the diplomatic relationship between the two countries.",
