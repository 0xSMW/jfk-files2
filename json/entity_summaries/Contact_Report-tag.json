  "summary": "Contact Reports are a recurring document type detailing interactions between CIA personnel (case officers) and various individuals, including foreign officials, assets, and potential sources of information. These reports cover a wide range of topics, from intelligence gathering on Soviet and Cuban activities during the Cold War to assessing individuals' views on terrorism and conspiracy theories. They often involve operational guidance, security measures, and the discussion of sensitive information. The reports also document attempts to gather intelligence through various contacts and operations, including surveillance of Soviet officials and discussions with assets about travel opportunities for intelligence gathering. The timeline spans from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, reflecting ongoing intelligence activities across different geopolitical contexts. A notable pattern is the use of codenames for individuals and operations, as well as the focus on gathering information related to foreign intelligence activities and potential security threats.",
