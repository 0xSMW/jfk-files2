  "summary": "J. C. King was the Chief of the Western Hemisphere (WH) Division of the CIA. A memorandum from J.C. King to the Deputy Director (Plans) requests approval for the revised Related Mission Directive for Mexico, which outlines objectives related to countering communism and maintaining friendly relations with the Mexican government. The documents suggest that J.C. King was involved in overseeing and approving covert operations and directives in the Western Hemisphere, particularly in Mexico and Cuba, during the Cold War era. These operations included telephone tapping, supporting anti-communist movements, and potentially involvement in assassination plots against Fidel Castro. The timeline of involvement spans from at least 1961 to 1968, based on the document dates.",
