  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Mr. Tolson, sometimes referred to as Tolson or Mr. Tolson, is not explicitly mentioned in the context of FBI investigations, surveillance, and intelligence activities. The documents focus on individuals involved in organized crime, such as John Roselli, Gabriel Mannarino, Santo Trafficante Jr., Sam Giancana, and William Alexander Parzow, as well as FBI procedures, CIA liaison activities, gambling operations, mail interception programs, and responses to Senate Select Committee inquiries. Therefore, it is impossible to determine Mr. Tolson's role, connections, or timeline of involvement based solely on these documents.",
