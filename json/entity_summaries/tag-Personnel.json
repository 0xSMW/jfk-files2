The documents also reveal potential connections between CIA personnel and individuals or organizations of interest to the JFK investigation, such as Lee Harvey Oswald and Cuban officials. The discussions about cover stories and security measures raise questions about the extent to which the CIA may have been involved in concealing information related to the assassination.",
