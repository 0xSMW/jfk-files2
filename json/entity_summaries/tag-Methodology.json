  "summary": "The documents highlight \"Methodology\" primarily in the context of CIA counterintelligence practices, media manipulation, and the verification of historical records related to the JFK assassination investigation. The Senate Select Committee hearings in 1976 (documents dated March 10, March 25, January 22, and March 9) extensively discuss CIA methodologies concerning the use of academics, media, and grantees, including restrictions and prohibitions on certain practices. The interview with Donald Deneslya touches on CIA activities and information related to Lee Harvey Oswald. A specific report (document ID 104-10227-10003) focuses on the methodology for verifying transcriptions of a 1962 tape involving Nosenko, indicating a concern for accuracy in historical records. Yuri Nosenko's testimony before the HSCA also contributes to the understanding of investigative methodologies used in the JFK assassination case.",
