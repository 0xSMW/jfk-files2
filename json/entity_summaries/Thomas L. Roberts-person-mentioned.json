  "summary": "Thomas L. Roberts is identified as a person connected to Herbert Itkin, a CIA informant. He is described as a \"negro lawyer\" and a deep cover agent for the CIA in Dakar. The documents suggest that Roberts's connection to Itkin was of interest to the FBI, as they requested additional information on him in relation to Itkin's case. The documents do not specify the exact nature of Roberts's involvement with Itkin or the CIA, but his identification as a deep cover agent indicates a significant role within the agency.",

  "significance": "Thomas L. Roberts's significance in the JFK assassination context is indirect. He is mentioned in documents related to Herbert Itkin, whose claims of CIA involvement and possible connections to Allen Dulles were being investigated. Roberts's identification as a deep cover CIA agent in Dakar suggests a potential link between Itkin's activities and the CIA, which was a subject of scrutiny in the context of the JFK assassination investigations.",
