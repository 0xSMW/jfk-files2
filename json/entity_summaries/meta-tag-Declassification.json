  "summary": "Declassification, particularly within the context of the JFK assassination records, involves the systematic review and release of classified documents to the public, largely spurred by the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. This process necessitates balancing transparency with the protection of sensitive information, such as intelligence sources, methods (including COMINT), and ongoing operations. Various agencies like the CIA, FBI, and Department of Justice, along with the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), participate in this effort. Internal debates and challenges arise concerning the potential compromise of covert operations, personnel, and relationships with foreign intelligence agencies, sometimes leading to sanitization requests or delayed releases. The management of classified information also includes handling requests for declassification, justifying classifications (such as those related to Operation MHCHAOS), and addressing concerns from Congress and foreign governments like Australia.",
