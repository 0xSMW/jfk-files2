He is mentioned in the context of Senate Select Committee hearings in March 1976, which discussed topics such as restrictions on the CIA's operational use of academics and grantees, the covert use of media and academics by the CIA, and the DCI's responsibilities and coordination of intelligence activities. The documents do not explicitly state his role in the JFK assassination context, but his involvement in security clearances and Senate Select Committee hearings related to intelligence activities suggests a role within governmental operations and intelligence oversight during that period.",
