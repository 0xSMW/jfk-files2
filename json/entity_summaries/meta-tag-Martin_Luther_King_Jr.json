  "summary": "Martin Luther King Jr., a significant civil rights leader, appears in these documents primarily in the context of investigations surrounding his assassination in 1968. The FBI conducted surveillance on King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), scrutinizing potential communist ties, particularly those involving Stanley Levison. Congressional committees, including the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) and the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), sought information from the FBI and CIA regarding King and his associates. Mentions also include potential suspects in his assassination, media coverage of his death, and his posthumous recognition, such as his association with the World Peace Council. His name also appears in indices searches and station traces, indicating routine checks and connections to other individuals.",
