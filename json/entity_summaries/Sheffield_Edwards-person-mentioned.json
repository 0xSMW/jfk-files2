  "significance": "Sheffield Edwards' significance in the JFK context stems from his potential involvement in CIA plots against Fidel Castro, which were investigated by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the Rockefeller Commission. The documents suggest a possible connection between the CIA's activities against Castro and the events surrounding the JFK assassination, as the Warren Commission was criticized for not being fully informed about these plots. Edwards' role in these activities makes him a relevant figure in understanding the potential motivations and actors involved in the assassination.",
