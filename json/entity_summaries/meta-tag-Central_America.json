  "summary": "Central America, also referred to as Latin America and the Caribbean, was a region of significant interest to the CIA, particularly during the Cold War era. The documents reveal the CIA's focus on countering Cuban influence and the spread of communism, monitoring political activities, and potentially influencing events through various operations. These operations involved intelligence gathering, anti-communist propaganda dissemination (through organizations like INCA), and efforts to control travel, curb propaganda, and prevent the movement of guerrillas and arms. Specific areas of concern included potential illegal arms shipments, anti-Castro activities, and political instability in countries like Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The CIA's Miami Station played a role in intelligence collection and anti-Castro operations in the Caribbean.",
