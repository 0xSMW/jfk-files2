  "summary": "The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) is a significant entity within the documents, primarily due to the FBI's extensive investigations into the organization and its leader, Martin Luther King Jr. These investigations, which focused on alleged communist ties and associations with individuals like Stanley Levison, were a key focus of the FBI's activities. The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) later requested and received materials from the FBI regarding these investigations. The documents also mention Hosea Williams in connection to claims regarding the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.",
