  "summary": "Victor L. Trinkala is a person of interest due to his connection with Richard C. Nagell and his underage enlistment in the U.S. Army. In 1969, an anonymous tip suggested Trinkala, en route to Vietnam, was contacted by a \"Soviet Agent\" due to his conscientious objector status, potentially for anti-U.S. propaganda. Trinkala sought discharge from the Army, claiming he was underage at enlistment, with his records incorrectly stating his birthdate as November 28, 1950, when it was actually November 28, 1951. He was interviewed in February 1970 regarding his character and loyalty, during which he was considered reluctant and evasive. Trinkala stated that Richard Nagell helped him get discharged.",

Nagell, whose activities and associations were scrutinized in connection to the assassination. The investigation into Trinkala's underage enlistment and discharge, potentially influenced by Nagell, raises questions about Nagell's motives and potential involvement in broader activities.",
