The agent's cover employment was with the Inter-University Committee for Political and Social Action (ICPSA). Documents discuss AMMUG/1's cover employment, attempts to purchase a house, and credit checks. There is also a mention of AMMUG/1 being unable to identify Manuel ESTEVEZ Perez from a query. An operation involving AMMUG/1 in Central America and the Caribbean is referenced, with target analysis and operational leads being outlined. Decisions regarding AMMUG/1's home purchase were deferred pending decisions on their WOFACT future, with a request from Langosch in Frankfurt mentioned.",
