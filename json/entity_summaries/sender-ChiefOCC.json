  "summary": "The Chief/Office of Covert Communications (OCC) within the CIA played a key role in complying with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.  The OCC was responsible for coordinating with various CIA stations (Paris, Bonn, Mexico City, Caracas, San Jose) to contact former employees residing abroad. The purpose of these communications was to inform these individuals that their names appeared in JFK assassination records and that these records might be publicly released. The OCC provided guidance to these former employees on how to respond if they had concerns about the potential disclosure of their names. The cables indicate a coordinated effort in the mid-1990s (specifically 1995 and 1997) to address the requirements of the Act and manage the potential impact on former CIA personnel.",
