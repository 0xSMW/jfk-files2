  "summary": "Accommodation addresses, as referenced in these documents, are temporary or discreet locations used by agents for mail handling and lodging, often under aliases, to maintain operational security. These addresses were crucial for agents operating in sensitive locations such as Mexico City, Brazil, and potentially Cuba, especially during the REDSOX operation and related activities around 1960-1961. The documents highlight the logistical challenges of securing these addresses, including the use of PO Boxes and the urgency in establishing them for agents being dispatched to Cuba. The need for accommodation addresses underscores the clandestine nature of the operations and the efforts to conceal the identities and movements of involved personnel.",
