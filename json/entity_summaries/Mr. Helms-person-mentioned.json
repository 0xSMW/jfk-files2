  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Mr. Helms is a person of interest due to his position within the CIA. While the documents do not explicitly detail his role in the JFK assassination, they suggest he held a high-level position within the CIA, as indicated by Howard Osborn's testimony that Mr. Helms was aware of the New York mail openings. The documents also mention Mr. Ober's requests for documentation related to the creation of the Special Counterintelligence Operation in mid-1967, which may indirectly involve Mr. Helms if he was in a leadership role at that time. The timeline of his involvement is not fully clear from these documents, but the references span from mid-1967 to the mid-1970s during the Rockefeller Commission hearings.",
