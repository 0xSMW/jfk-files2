  "significance": "Based on the documents provided, Sullivan's significance in the JFK assassination context is indirect. He is not explicitly linked to the assassination itself, but rather to the broader intelligence and law enforcement landscape of the time. His role in managing FBI-CIA relations and overseeing domestic intelligence operations places him in a position to have been aware of relevant information, though the documents do not directly implicate him in any specific actions related to the assassination.",
