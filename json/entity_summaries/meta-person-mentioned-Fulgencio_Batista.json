  "summary": "Fulgencio Batista, the former President of Cuba, is mentioned in the context of the political climate surrounding the Cuban Revolution and its aftermath. His ouster by Fidel Castro created a power vacuum and fueled anti-Castro movements, involving Cuban exiles who were supported by the CIA and engaged in potential assassination plots. While no direct link to the JFK assassination is established, Batista's role in the Cuban Revolution indirectly connects to the broader context through the activities of these exiles and their relationships with US intelligence agencies. Some documents also focus on CIA operations involving individuals connected to anti-Castro activities, highlighting concerns about their loyalties and security risks.",
