  "summary": "Hugh C. McDonald is associated with World Associates, Inc., and is the subject of a CIA case file (Case 52872). The CIA assessed McDonald's voice identification system and considered utilizing him for intelligence gathering during a planned world tour. The documents detail security clearances related to McDonald and his company. One document explores the possibility that Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Soviet scientist, might be the 'unidentified man' photographed entering and departing the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City in October 1963, and explores potential connections between MOSKALEV and an individual known as 'Saul' who claimed involvement in the Kennedy assassination. Another document discusses an Identi-kit project and a magazine article that incorrectly stated the U.S. Intelligence underwrote the development, prompting an investigation into potential disclosure of classified information.",
