  "summary": "The documents mention Libya in the context of CIA activities and intelligence gathering. One document from 1970 references GSFEW/1 personnel in Libya and technical matters related to radio systems. The other three documents from 1998 summarize contacts with intelligence source FCSTANDARD/32 in Addis Ababa, where discussions included Sudan, Libya, and observations about individuals and security practices. Libya appears as a topic of interest within broader intelligence operations in the region, suggesting it was an area of focus for the CIA during these periods. The documents do not directly link Libya to the JFK assassination.",
