  "summary": "The documents highlight investigations into alleged Communist influence, particularly within the civil rights movement and in connection to individuals like Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison. The FBI, as indicated by the testimony of Alan G. Sentinella, conducted surveillance and investigations to determine the extent of this influence, focusing on potential connections and exploitation by foreign entities. The documents span from 1968 to 1975, with a concentration on Sentinella's 1975 testimony before the Senate Select Committee (SSC). A notable pattern is the repeated mention of electronic surveillance and the attempt to link civil rights figures and organizations to communist elements.",
