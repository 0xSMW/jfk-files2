  "summary": "The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was established to oversee the declassification and release of government records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, as mandated by the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The ARRB worked to make assassination-related records available to the public, balancing the need for transparency with concerns about national security, personal privacy, and the protection of intelligence sources and methods. A significant portion of their work involved reviewing HSCA (House Select Committee on Assassinations) staff payroll records, often postponing the release of Social Security numbers to protect personal privacy. They interacted with various government agencies, including the CIA, to review documents, address concerns about sensitive information, and negotiate the release of records. The ARRB also engaged in international cooperation, such as seeking access to records held by the BKGB (Belarusian KGB) related to Lee Harvey Oswald's time in Minsk. The ARRB's activities spanned from the mid-1990s to the late 1990s, focusing on identifying, reviewing, and releasing JFK assassination records to the public.",
