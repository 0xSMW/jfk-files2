  "summary": "NWBOLTON is an entity of interest in the JFK assassination context, with multiple documents referencing them. The documents suggest that NWBOLTON was suspected by some, including LPAVERT, of involvement in President Kennedy's assassination. There are concerns about the potential public disclosure of covert affiliations of former NWBOLTON employees due to the Assassination Records Review Board's document release. A person claiming former association with NWBOLTON, Robert Plumlee, alleged he sabotaged a Denver Magazine article related to the assassination trail. Additionally, NWBOLTON is linked to a Rio <JFK> conference suspected of being an anti-NWBOLTON propaganda effort by the Cubans. The timeline of involvement spans from at least 1995 to 1996, based on the document dates.",
