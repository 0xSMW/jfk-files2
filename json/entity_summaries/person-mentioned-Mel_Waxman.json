  "summary": "Mel Waxman was an employee of the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). His name appears in several payroll and certification reports from 1977 and 1978, indicating his employment during the committee's investigation into the JFK assassination. The documents list his position and salary during these periods. A 1995 document mentions the Assassination Records Review Board's decision to postpone the release of HSCA staff payroll records, redacting Social Security numbers, and includes payroll authorization forms for Mel Waxman. This suggests that his employment records were subject to review and privacy considerations even years after the HSCA's work concluded.",
