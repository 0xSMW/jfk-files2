  "summary": "Howard Hunt is mentioned in three documents. One document references a telephone call involving Sturgis discussing Hunt along with other individuals like Barber, Knowless, Bill Johnson, Carlos Prio, Carlos Marcello, and Marita Lorenz, and their connections to the CIA, Cuba, and the Bay of Pigs. Another document is a summary report about Charles William Wiley's background, recruitment, activities, and termination with the CIA. The third document involves a report from the Director of Finance to the Inspector General regarding a search for unaccounted payments to Howard Hunt, finding no large unrecorded payments but noting unusual financial procedures. The documents suggest Hunt had connections to individuals involved with the CIA and Cuban affairs, and there were financial inquiries related to him.",
