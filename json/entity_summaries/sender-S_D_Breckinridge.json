  "summary": "S. D. Breckinridge is identified as a sender of a memorandum dated September 22, 1978. In this memorandum, Breckinridge requests Ray Reardon to provide photographs of Agency employees with the surname Bishop who were employed in the 1960s. The purpose of this request was to aid witnesses in identifying a person named Morris Bishop. While the documents do not explicitly detail Breckinridge's role or significance in the JFK assassination context, the request for photographs suggests an investigative or identification process related to individuals potentially connected to the assassination or related events. The other documents in the collection relate to George Joannides and the CIA's handling of the Yuriy Nosenko case, as well as the House Select Committee on Assassinations' (HSCA) request for access to the Hart Report, but do not directly involve Breckinridge.",
