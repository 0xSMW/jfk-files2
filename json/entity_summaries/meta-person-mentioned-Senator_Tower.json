  "summary": "Senator John G. Tower, often referred to as Senator Tower or simply Tower, was a member of the Senate Select Committee (SSC), also known as the Church Committee, which investigated intelligence activities in the mid-1970s. His role primarily involved overseeing and investigating potential abuses of power by intelligence agencies such as the CIA and FBI. He participated in briefings regarding warrantless electronic surveillances and surreptitious entries conducted by the CIA, as well as the FBI's interactions with the SSC, including the provision of information related to intelligence activities and individuals like Martin Luther King, Jr. The documents suggest the SSC, including Tower, reviewed and investigated intelligence matters, including FBI operations and potential compromises.",
