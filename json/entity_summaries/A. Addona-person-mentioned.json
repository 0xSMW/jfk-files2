  "summary": "A. Addona appears as an intermediary in the routing of memoranda regarding the classification of document EX 3600. Specifically, memoranda from P. Haefner (or J. Haffner) to J.D. Lavery of OGC were routed 'via A. Addona'. The documents all pertain to the classification of EX 3600 due to its connection to Operation MHCHAOS and the inclusion of information from sensitive sources and classified FBI reports. Addona's role seems to be administrative, facilitating the flow of information between Haefner/Haffner and Lavery.",
