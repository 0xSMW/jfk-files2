  "significance": "The GRU's significance in the JFK context is indirect, based on the documents provided. The documents suggest the CIA was actively monitoring suspected GRU operatives and investigating Soviet defectors. The documents do not directly link the GRU to the JFK assassination, but rather highlight the agency's counterintelligence efforts against Soviet intelligence during the Cold War.",
