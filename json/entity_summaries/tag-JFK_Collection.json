  "summary": "The JFK Collection is a collection of documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The documents in this set primarily concern the review and potential declassification of information within the collection by the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB). A key concern revolves around protecting the identities of human intelligence sources and sensitive foreign government information, particularly Australian liaison documents. The CIA is shown to be actively involved in the review process, proposing substitutions and advocating for the postponement of the release of certain documents to safeguard individuals and intelligence operations. The documents highlight the balancing act between transparency mandated by the JFK Act and the need to protect ongoing intelligence activities and international relations.",
