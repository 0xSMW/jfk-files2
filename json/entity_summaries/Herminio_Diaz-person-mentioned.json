  "summary": "Herminio Diaz is mentioned in connection with anti-Castro activities and potential drug trafficking. A 1973 cable discusses station traces on him, focusing on his involvement in anti-Castro activities, potential connections to drug trafficking, and exile group affiliations. Another cable from 1973 reports that drug trafficker Alfredo Ordonez Gonzalez met with drug traffickers Evelio Duque and Herminio or Ermenegildo Diaz in Costa Rica. The cable requests traces on Duque and Diaz, and specifies the information is not to be shared with the DEA at that time. A 1967 FBI report on David Yaras mentions Luis Posada Carriles, a former CIA employee, but does not directly connect him to Herminio Diaz.",
