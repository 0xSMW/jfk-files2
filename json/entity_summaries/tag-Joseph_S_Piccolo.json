  "summary": "Joseph S. Piccolo was a CIA employee who resigned on 4 October 1961, as indicated by a cover debriefing memo outlining instructions for maintaining cover regarding his employment and travel history. His official personnel folder contains information about his career, including promotions, reassignments, and a notice of an official disability claim file. A notification indicates the cancellation of his military cover backstop, effective 11 June 1963, requiring the return of all military documentation. In 1968, a request was made for a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) overseas evaluation for Piccolo, who was an Operations Officer, to be reassigned from Managua, Nicaragua, to JMCOBRA. The documents suggest a career within the CIA involving overseas assignments and cover operations.",
