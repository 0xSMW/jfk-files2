  "summary": "The U.S. Government is referenced in several contexts within these documents. It engaged in contractual agreements for confidential information and services, as seen in the contract with Raymond H. Gerende in 1955. The government also played a role in guiding and financing the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) starting in 1961, aiming to unify Cuban exile groups, though this relationship later faced disappointment from the exiles regarding U.S. policy towards Cuba. Additionally, the U.S. Government is mentioned in connection with threats of exposure by Nagell, who made demands and threatened to reveal information if his demands were not met, appearing at U.S. consulates in Zurich and Barcelona.",
