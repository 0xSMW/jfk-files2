  "summary": "The documents mention passports in various contexts related to individuals and their movements, particularly concerning Cuba and Guatemala. In one instance, the FBI investigated individuals possibly traveling to Cuba, checking their records and movements. Another document details the arrest and expulsion of ANUPAS-1 in Guatemala, who possessed multiple U.S. passports and Coxie propaganda. CIA projects in Mexico City involved passport renewals for agents. Additionally, a receipt acknowledges the transfer of authentication materials, including passports, for Ernesto Jesus GARCIA Guzman, noting the return of his Cuban documents. The recurring theme is the use of passports in international travel and intelligence operations, often linked to Cold War tensions and concerns about individuals' affiliations and movements.",
