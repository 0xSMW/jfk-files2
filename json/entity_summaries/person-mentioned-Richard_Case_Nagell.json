  "summary": "Richard Case Nagell is mentioned in several CIA cables and a memorandum. He is portrayed as someone who threatened to expose his contacts with an organization referred to as 'WOFIRM' if promises made by US officials were not honored. He is described as a 'fabricator and mental case' who caused trouble for Swiss and U.S. consulates, particularly in Zurich, where he claimed a document intended for American military authorities in Berlin was stolen. A memorandum outlines procedures for handling Office of Security files reviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) regarding Nagell, ensuring sensitive information remains protected. His name also appears in Dick Russell's book 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'.",
