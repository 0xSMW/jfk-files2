  "summary": "Military records, in the context of the JFK assassination documents, encompass official documentation related to individuals' service in the armed forces. These records are significant because they provide background information on individuals connected to the assassination, potentially revealing details about their training, assignments, and personal history. The documents highlight the importance of military records in investigations, as seen in the review of Lawrence Huber Florer's USAF file and the inclusion of Lee Harvey Oswald's military records among other personal documents provided by the Social Security Administration. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) also sought to declassify military records related to U.S. policy toward Cuba, indicating a broader interest in military involvement and policy during the period surrounding the assassination.",
