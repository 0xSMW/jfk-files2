These notifications primarily address the postponement of releasing Social Security numbers from HSCA staff payroll records to protect personal privacy. The documents indicate a consistent pattern of the ARRB making final determinations to postpone the release of sensitive personal information, specifically Social Security numbers, from HSCA payroll records. These determinations are documented in notifications accompanying payroll records and authorization forms for HSCA staff members like Wendy S. Collins and Cynthia S. Cooper.",
