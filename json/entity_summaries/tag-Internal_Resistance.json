  "summary": "The concept of 'Internal Resistance' in the provided documents primarily refers to efforts within Cuba to oppose and potentially overthrow the Castro regime, as opposed to external invasions or actions by exile groups alone. Manolo Ray, an exile leader of the People's Revolutionary Movement (MRP), consistently advocated for internal resistance, emphasizing the need for financial support and trained exiles to aid those within Cuba rather than a direct U.S. invasion. The Cuba Project progress report also mentions monitoring internal conditions within Cuba. The documents suggest that internal resistance was considered a viable, and in some cases preferred, strategy for affecting change in Cuba during the early 1960s.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the focus on internal resistance reflects the broader strategies being considered and implemented by the U.S. government and Cuban exile groups to destabilize or overthrow the Castro regime. While the documents do not directly link internal resistance to the assassination, they provide insight into the political climate and the various factions involved in anti-Castro activities, which are relevant to understanding potential motives and actors related to the assassination.",
