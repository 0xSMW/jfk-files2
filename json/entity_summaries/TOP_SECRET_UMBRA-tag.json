  "summary": "TOP SECRET UMBRA is a classification marking used on intelligence reports, primarily from the National Security Agency (NSA), related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. These reports detail global reactions, potential involvement of foreign entities, and internal assessments following the assassination. The documents cover a range of topics, including reactions from various countries (Cuba, Poland, Iran, Thailand, Morocco, Syria, Norway, Mexico, Haiti, Indonesia, Ghana, South Korea, Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, Argentina, Hungary), potential conspiracy theories (Zionist involvement, Russian and Cuban involvement), and the impact on U.S. foreign policy. The reports span from November 1963 to 1977, with the bulk of the documents concentrated in the immediate aftermath of the assassination. A notable pattern is the focus on collecting and analyzing international reactions and assessing potential threats or policy shifts in the wake of Kennedy's death.",
