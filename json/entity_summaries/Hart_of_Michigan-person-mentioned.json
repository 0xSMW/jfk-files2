  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive summary about \"Hart of Michigan\" or their role/significance in the JFK assassination context. The documents mention Senate Select Committee hearings and discussions on topics such as CIA restrictions, FBI intelligence activities, and testimony from individuals like Richard Goodwin and Director Clarence M. Kelley. However, none of the summaries explicitly mention \"Hart of Michigan\" or provide any information about their identity, role, connections, timeline of involvement, or patterns across the documents. Therefore, any attempt to create a summary would be speculative and not based on the provided information.",
