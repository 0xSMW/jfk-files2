  "summary": "Santiago Alvarez Rodriguez was a person of interest to the FBI, particularly in relation to Cuban revolutionary matters and potential anti-Castro activities. An FBI report from 1962 details efforts to gather information on him, including attempts to interview individuals like Orlando Piedra and Roberto Fernandez Miranda. In 1961, the FBI Miami office closed its case on him due to his inactivity, but noted the CIA's continued interest in his son and yacht. He was also allegedly involved with the 'Esbirros' scandal sheet. He appears in a 1967 FBI report detailing the activities of Manuel Artime and the MRR, a Cuban exile group, though the specific nature of his involvement isn't detailed in the summary.",
