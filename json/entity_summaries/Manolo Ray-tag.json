  "summary": "Manolo Ray was an exile leader of the People's Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo - MRP). He opposed a U.S. invasion of Cuba, advocating instead for internal resistance supported by a broad base within Cuba. He believed that funds and trained exiles were more crucial than a direct invasion to overthrow Castro. His statements were relayed by the British Service to the CIA. One document mentions a meeting between an ODACID officer and IOEN, an \"engineering consultant\", who inquired about Natolo Ray's training efforts in Costa Rica, raising suspicions about IOEN's potential involvement with KUBARK or other entities. The documents indicate that Ray's statements and activities were of interest to the CIA and other intelligence agencies during the early 1960s.",
