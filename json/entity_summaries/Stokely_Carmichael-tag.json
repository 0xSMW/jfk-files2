  "summary": "Stokely Carmichael, a prominent figure in the Civil Rights Movement, is mentioned in three documents. These documents primarily relate to investigations and information gathering by government agencies like the FBI and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. While the documents do not directly connect Carmichael to the JFK assassination, they place him within the context of surveillance and intelligence operations during the 1960s and 1970s. The documents suggest that Carmichael was a person of interest to these agencies, likely due to his activism and involvement in organizations perceived as potentially subversive or connected to international movements.",
