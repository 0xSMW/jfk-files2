The assessment of the Johnson Administration's policies, for example, could shed light on shifts in US foreign policy following Kennedy's death. Similarly, assessments of individuals with potential ties to intelligence agencies, such as Nosenko, are crucial for evaluating the credibility of information related to the assassination and potential conspiracies.",
