  "summary": "Zurich, acting as a sender of cables, is primarily associated with the Richard Case Nagell situation in early 1969. The cables originate from Zurich and discuss Nagell's threats to expose the US government if his demands were not met. These threats involved revealing contacts with an organization referred to as WOFIRM. Nagell disappeared from Zurich after making these threats, later resurfacing at the US Consulate in Barcelona where he continued to make similar threats. The cables indicate a concern within the Zurich office regarding Nagell's potential actions and the need for guidance from higher authorities, specifically Bern, on how to handle the situation.",
