  "summary": "The documents reference 'insurgency' in various contexts. One document mentions an insurgent group called the Cuban Revolutionary Junta active inside Cuba in 1971. Another document from 1963 broadly covers various topics, including 'insurgency' as part of the Cuban internal situation. A third document from 1968 discusses LIRING-3's activities related to the insurgency movement in Guatemala and efforts to manage the perception of this insurgency among Cuban entities. The documents suggest that 'insurgency' is a recurring theme in the context of Cuban and Guatemalan affairs during the Cold War era.",

The connection is indirect, as the documents highlight the political instability and subversive activities occurring in the region during the time period relevant to the assassination.",
