  "summary": "The Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) was a pro-Castro organization active in the early 1960s, advocating for normalized relations with Cuba. The FPCC drew significant interest from U.S. intelligence agencies like the FBI and CIA, with the CIA even considering planting articles to discredit the organization. This interest stemmed from concerns about the FPCC's potential connections to communist activities and the Cuban government. Lee Harvey Oswald's involvement with the FPCC, particularly his activities in New Orleans and interactions with individuals like Carlos Bringuier, made the organization a focal point in investigations related to the JFK assassination. Other individuals connected to the FPCC include Richard Thomas Gibson (also known as \"Sugar\"), Michael Stratton, and Court Wood.",
