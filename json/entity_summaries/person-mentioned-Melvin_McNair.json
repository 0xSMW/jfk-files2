  "summary": "Melvin McNair was a Delta Airlines hijacker in Algiers, as reported in a CIA cable dated October 2, 1972. He provided information regarding William Holder's role in the Black Panther Party (BPP) and the strained relationship between Eldridge Cleaver and other BPP members. Other documents mention American Black militants/hijackers moving between Algeria, France, and Switzerland, with intentions to return to the U.S. for revolutionary activities. These individuals, including George Edward Wright, received support in Paris from Henri Curiel's organization to obtain plastic surgery and false documentation for re-entry into the U.S. Melvin McNair's involvement appears to be primarily within the context of Black Panther Party activities and hijacking incidents during the early 1970s.",
