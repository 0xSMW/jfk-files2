  "summary": "The documents provided do not explicitly define or describe \"Cover Protection\" as an entity. Instead, they pertain to the CIA's process of complying with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The documents focus on the process of informing former employees, residing in various locations such as Costa Rica, Germany, Caracas, and Hong Kong, that their names appear in JFK assassination records and advising them on the potential public release of this information. The CIA stations were requested to assist in contacting these individuals and providing guidance on how to request postponement of public disclosure if warranted. The documents highlight the CIA's efforts to balance transparency under the Act with the protection of individuals' identities.",
