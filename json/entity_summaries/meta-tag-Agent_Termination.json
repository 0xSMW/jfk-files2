  "summary": "The documents pertain to various forms of agent termination, including retirement, resignation, and contract termination, primarily within the CIA and, to a lesser extent, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). These terminations are documented through personnel records, payroll records, contracts, and other administrative documents spanning from the 1940s to the 1990s. Reasons for termination range from voluntary retirement with commendations and security briefings, to resignations due to career changes or potential security compromises, to involuntary terminations due to budgetary constraints, security breaches, or the completion of objectives. A key concern is the handling of sensitive information and potential security risks associated with terminated agents and projects, including the management of alias documents and resettlement assistance.",
