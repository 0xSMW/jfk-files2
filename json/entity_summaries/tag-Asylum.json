  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, the term \"Asylum\" appears to be a tag used to categorize documents related to individuals seeking refuge or defection, primarily from communist regimes like Cuba. The documents highlight instances of Cuban defectors providing intelligence, potential political instability leading to individuals seeking asylum, and the broader context of anti-communist activities. The documents do not directly link \"Asylum\" to the JFK assassination, but rather use it as a descriptor for situations involving individuals fleeing their home countries due to political or ideological reasons.",
