  "summary": "The Special Affairs Staff (SAS) was a component of the CIA involved in various covert operations during the early 1960s. Documents indicate their involvement in providing cover for CIA agents, as seen in the request for military cover for Ross Crozier. They also had a support component (SAS/Support) that handled logistical aspects such as providing alias documentation for employees. The documents suggest SAS was active in planning and executing operations in various locations, including the Southeastern United States, Latin America, and Rome. One document mentions the AMLASH operation, a CIA effort to organize a military coup against Fidel Castro, although the specific role of SAS in that operation is not detailed in these documents. The timeline of SAS's involvement spans from at least May 1963 to October 1963, based on the dates of the documents provided.",
