  "summary": "CORU (Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations) was an organization of Cuban exiles. The documents indicate CORU's involvement in various activities, including a meeting in the Dominican Republic in June 1976, and potential connections to the death of Orlando Letelier. One document mentions an attack on a Cuban Embassy attache's house in Lima, Peru, and references coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations. CORU is also linked to individuals like Rolando Otero Hernandez, who coordinated between exiles in Miami and Santiago, Chile, and Luis Posada Carriles, who was involved in terrorist plotting by Cuban exiles.",

  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, CORU's significance in the JFK context is not explicitly stated. However, the organization's involvement in anti-Castro activities and connections to individuals implicated in terrorist plots suggest a potential indirect link to the broader context of US-Cuban relations and related covert operations during that era. Further research would be needed to establish any direct connection to the JFK assassination.",
