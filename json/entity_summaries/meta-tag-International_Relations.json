  "summary": "The documents reveal that \"International Relations\" is a significant tag within the JFK assassination context, encompassing US foreign policy, global reactions to Kennedy's death, and the geopolitical landscape of the era. The documents cover US policy towards countries like Cuba, Vietnam, and the Soviet Union, as well as the impact of the assassination on CIA operations and potential shifts in foreign policy under the Johnson administration. Concerns about foreign government scrutiny, the attendance of world leaders at Kennedy's funeral, and the complex interplay between domestic politics, international relations, and intelligence operations are also highlighted. The Cold War context, including Chinese Communist relations and Bloc activities, is also relevant. Academic expertise, such as that of Richard Walker from the University of South Carolina, is also noted.",
