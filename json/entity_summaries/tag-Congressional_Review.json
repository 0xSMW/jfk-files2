The documents reveal that the Senate Select Committee specifically inquired about the NSA's involvement with the Warren Commission, including a review of exhibits for secret writing and information about Cuban military alerts after the assassination. This highlights the congressional interest in understanding the intelligence community's role and actions related to the JFK assassination and its aftermath.",
