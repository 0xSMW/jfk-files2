The British Service is mentioned as the source of statements made by Manolo Ray, a Cuban exile leader, regarding the People's Revolutionary Movement (MRP) and his opposition to a U.S. invasion of Cuba. The documents suggest that the British Service was actively monitoring and reporting on the activities and opinions of key figures within the Cuban exile community, providing insights into their plans and perspectives.",
