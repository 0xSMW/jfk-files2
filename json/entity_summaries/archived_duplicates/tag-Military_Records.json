  "summary": "Military records, in the context of the JFK assassination investigation, encompass official documentation related to individuals' service in the armed forces. These records are significant because they provide background information, service history, and potential connections to events or individuals relevant to the assassination. The documents highlight the importance of military records in understanding the backgrounds and activities of individuals like Lawrence Huber Florer and Lee Harvey Oswald. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) also sought to declassify military records related to U.S. policy toward Cuba, indicating a broader interest in military involvement and related decision-making during the period surrounding the assassination.",
