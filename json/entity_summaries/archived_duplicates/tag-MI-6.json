  "summary": "MI-6, British Intelligence, appears in these documents primarily in the context of information sharing with U.S. intelligence agencies like the CIA and FBI. Their role involves providing information related to individuals and events of interest to U.S. investigations, including potential provocateurs in Cuba, claims related to Lee Harvey Oswald, and unauthorized travel to Cuba. The documents span from 1961 to 1964, indicating a period of active information exchange. A notable pattern is MI-6's role as an information source, often relaying intelligence gathered from their own sources, such as British newspapermen or observations from their London post.",
