  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, William Sullivan is not directly mentioned. However, the documents heavily feature Alan G. Sentinella's testimony before the Senate Select Committee (SSC) regarding investigations into Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison. These investigations involved electronic surveillance and potential communist influence. The documents also mention John Rosselli's activities and associations, as well as the CIA's Office of Security activities, including electronic and physical surveillance. The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) meeting minutes discuss audiosurveillance and other intelligence matters. While Sullivan is not directly named, the context of these documents suggests a potential connection to intelligence activities and investigations during the relevant period.",

The documents focus more on investigations related to Martin Luther King Jr., the SCLC, Stanley Levison, and general intelligence activities. Without further information, it's difficult to establish a direct link to the JFK assassination.",
