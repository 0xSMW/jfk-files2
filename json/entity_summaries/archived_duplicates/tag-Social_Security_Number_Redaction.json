  "summary": "The redaction of Social Security numbers appears across several payroll-related documents from the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). These documents include payroll authorization forms, memoranda, and final determination notifications. The redaction is likely done to protect the privacy of HSCA staff members such as Charlotte Green, Kenneth S. McHargh, Barbara Jean Robinson, Edwin J. Lopez, Barbara L. Mosley, Oliver J. Champion, and Judith R. Burford. The documents span from 1977 to 1978, indicating a consistent practice of redacting this information during that period. The presence of 'Final Determination Notifications' suggests a formal review process regarding the redaction of Social Security numbers, possibly mandated by the Assassination Records Review Board.",
