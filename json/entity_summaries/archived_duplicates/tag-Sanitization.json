  "summary": "In the context of the JFK assassination records, 'sanitization' refers to the process of redacting or removing sensitive information from documents before their release to the public. This process aims to balance transparency with the protection of classified intelligence sources, methods, and privacy concerns. The CIA engaged in sanitization efforts while reviewing and releasing JFK assassination records, as seen in meetings with the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) and discussions regarding FOIA requests. Sanitization decisions involved considerations of crypts, project names, sensitive foreign documents, and the protection of sources and methods related to Lee Harvey Oswald case files. The documents highlight the CIA's efforts to comply with transparency mandates while safeguarding national security interests.",

In the JFK context, it highlights the challenges faced by agencies like the CIA in releasing historical records while safeguarding intelligence sources, methods, and national security interests. The process of sanitization and the decisions surrounding it were subject to scrutiny by the ARRB and other oversight bodies.",
