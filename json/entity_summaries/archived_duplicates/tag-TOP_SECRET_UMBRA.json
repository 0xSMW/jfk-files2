  "summary": "TOP SECRET UMBRA is a classification marking used on intelligence reports, primarily from the National Security Agency (NSA), related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. These reports detail global reactions, potential conspiracies, and security measures taken by various countries following the assassination in November 1963. The documents cover a range of topics, including foreign government condolences, concerns about potential policy shifts in the U.S., speculation about the involvement of various groups (e.g., Zionists, Cubans, Soviets), and the impact of Kennedy's death on international relations and disarmament talks. The reports span from the immediate aftermath of the assassination in late 1963 into 1964, with some later documents referencing inquiries by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) in the 1970s. A notable pattern is the focus on Cuban reactions and potential involvement, as well as the monitoring of diplomatic communications to gauge global sentiment and potential threats.",
