  "summary": "The National Security Council (NSC) is a key entity involved in US foreign policy and national security matters. In the context of these documents, the NSC appears as a central point for deliberations and decision-making related to sensitive issues such as potential assassinations of foreign leaders (Trujillo, Castro, Lumumba) and US policy towards Cuba. The documents suggest the NSC played a role in overseeing covert actions and managing the containment of communism during the Cold War. The NSC also served as a point of contact for other government agencies, such as the FBI, regarding the release of sensitive documents to congressional committees investigating these matters.",
