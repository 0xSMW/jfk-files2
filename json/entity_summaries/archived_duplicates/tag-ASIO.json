  "summary": "The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) is mentioned in several documents primarily concerning the declassification of Warren Commission document CD-971. Sir Charles Spry of ASIO recommended against declassification due to concerns about an investigation into anonymous telephone calls to the Canberra Embassy before and after President Kennedy's assassination. ASIO's involvement also extends to a request from Australian Justice A.R. Moffitt, delivered via ASIO representative Leslie V. Jarvis, for information on Herbert Itkin, a former CIA and FBI employee, in connection to an inquiry into organized crime in New South Wales. The documents indicate ASIO's role in liaising between Australian and US intelligence agencies regarding matters related to the JFK assassination investigation and subsequent inquiries.",
