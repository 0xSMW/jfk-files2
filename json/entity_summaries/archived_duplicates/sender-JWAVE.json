  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, JWAVE's significance lies in its involvement in covert operations related to Cuba and Cuban exiles. The monitoring of Cuban exile leadership and the exfiltration of assets from Cuba suggest a deep engagement in anti-Castro activities, which are relevant given the potential motives and actors involved in the assassination. The connection to individuals and events in Miami, a hub for anti-Castro activities, further underscores JWAVE's potential relevance to understanding the broader context surrounding the assassination.",
