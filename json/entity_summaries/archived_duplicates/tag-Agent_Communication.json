  "summary": "Agent communication, as a tag, encompasses the various methods and instances of contact between intelligence agents and their handlers or other relevant parties. The documents highlight several aspects of this communication, including the relaying of information about supplies and shipments (JMWAVE cable), intelligence gathering and potential military preparations in Cuba (NYJAT TYPIC AXKHAN-2 COMMO TARROT), contact information for specific agents like Rolando CUBELA Secades (AM/LASH), and operational details regarding agent activities and planned retrievals (Classified Message). These communications often involve code names, addresses, and specific instructions related to ongoing operations. The documents span from November to December 1963, indicating a concentrated period of activity. A notable pattern is the use of cables and classified messages to transmit sensitive information, reflecting the clandestine nature of these operations.",
