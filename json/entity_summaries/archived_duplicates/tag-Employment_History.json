  "summary": "The documents tagged with \"Employment History\" primarily consist of payroll records, personnel files, and agent reports related to individuals connected to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), the CIA, and other organizations. These records detail individuals' employment history, salary, positions held, and performance. The documents also include personal history statements, resumes, and biographic profiles. A recurring theme is the postponement of Social Security numbers from HSCA staff payroll records to protect personal privacy. Agent reports often focus on verifying employment details of individuals of interest, such as Robert Scheer and Manuel Marti, as part of investigations or pre-inductee screenings. The documents provide insights into the backgrounds and affiliations of individuals involved in or investigated by these organizations.",

  "significance": "In the JFK assassination context, employment history is significant for understanding the backgrounds, affiliations, and potential biases of individuals involved in the investigation or those who may have had relevant information. These records can reveal connections between individuals and organizations, uncover potential conflicts of interest, and provide context for assessing the credibility and motivations of witnesses and investigators. The documents also highlight the efforts to protect personal information, such as Social Security numbers, while still providing access to relevant historical records.",
