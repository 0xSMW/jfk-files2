  "significance": "The significance of 'File' in the JFK context is indirect. The documents suggest a review of CIA activities, including potential assassination attempts and covert operations, some of which relate to Cuba. E. Howard Hunt's denial of involvement in the JFK assassination is also mentioned. The 'File' appears to be part of a broader investigation or review of CIA activities, some of which may have tangential connections to the JFK assassination.",
