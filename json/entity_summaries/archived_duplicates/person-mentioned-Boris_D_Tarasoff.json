  "summary": "Boris D. Tarasoff was a CIA employee, specifically with the FDD/00 division, as indicated by a travel briefing sheet from 1960. His official personnel file contains memos, personnel action requests, and notices related to his employment, including retirement and reassignments. In 1960, he was authorized to travel to Mexico City for 90 days to replace a station employee on home leave. A memo from 1975 directs the removal of credit blocks for several individuals, including Tarasoff. There is also a memorandum detailing a meeting to discuss the potential security risks associated with Anna Tarasoff's father's planned visit to the Russian Embassy to obtain a visa, including the decision not to brief him on his daughter's CIA employment and to provide her with an army cover. A notable pattern is his involvement in overseas operations and security concerns related to his and his family's connections.",
