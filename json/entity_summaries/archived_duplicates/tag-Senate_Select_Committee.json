  "summary": "The Senate Select Committee, often referred to as the Church Committee (after its chairman, Senator Frank Church), was a U.S. Senate committee established in 1975 to investigate intelligence activities conducted by various government agencies, including the FBI and CIA. The committee's work involved reviewing domestic intelligence investigations, COINTELPRO activities, and potential abuses of power. The documents reveal the FBI's extensive interactions with the SSC, including providing documents, testimonies, and responding to inquiries related to investigations into Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Stanley Levison, and other intelligence matters. The committee also examined the authority of Congress to release classified data and considered legislative actions to reform and oversee intelligence agencies. A notable pattern across the documents is the FBI's concern over informant confidentiality, potential breaches of security, and the sensitivity of information shared with the committee.",

The committee sought information from various agencies regarding the assassination and related events, aiming to understand the extent of intelligence community knowledge and actions prior to and following President Kennedy's death. The committee's inquiries included the NSA's role in analyzing documents and messages related to Oswald and Cuban reactions to the assassination.",
