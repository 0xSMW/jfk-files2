  "summary": "Nikita Khrushchev, the former Premier of the Soviet Union, is mentioned in the context of the JFK assassination documents, primarily in relation to Soviet-Cuban relations and Cold War tensions. While not directly implicated in the assassination itself, his leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the broader geopolitical climate of the time are relevant. The documents suggest that the U.S. government was closely monitoring Soviet activities and interactions with Cuba, particularly concerning figures like Nikolay Sergeyevich Leonov and Fidel Castro. The overall context implies that the Cold War rivalry and the potential for Soviet involvement in Cuba were significant concerns during the Kennedy administration.",
