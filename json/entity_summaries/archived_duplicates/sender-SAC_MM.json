The documents indicate the Miami SAC was involved in gathering and disseminating intelligence related to anti-Castro activities, potential assassination plots against Cuban leaders, and monitoring individuals of interest. The office communicated with the Director of the FBI and other agencies like the CIA and United States Customs Office. The documents span from 1958 to 1967, showing a sustained focus on Cuban-related intelligence matters. A notable pattern is the relaying of information from Cuban double agents and CIA sources, as well as coordinating with other law enforcement agencies.",
