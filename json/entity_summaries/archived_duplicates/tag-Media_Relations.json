  "summary": "The documents highlight the CIA's interactions with media outlets and journalists, particularly concerning operational support, intelligence gathering, and propaganda dissemination. JMWAVE, a CIA station, had a relationship with AMCARBON-1 of The Miami Herald, using him for operational support, intelligence, and as a propaganda outlet. Newsweek's coverage of the CIA also prompted internal guidance on how to handle inquiries, emphasizing the protection of sensitive information. The documents also mention Robert J. KORENGOLD, a Newsweek correspondent, and a new story on Lee Harvey Oswald and the CIA in Japan, indicating the media's interest in the CIA's activities and potential connections to significant events.",
