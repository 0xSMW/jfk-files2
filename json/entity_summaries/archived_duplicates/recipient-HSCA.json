  "summary": "The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) was a committee of the United States House of Representatives established in 1976 to investigate the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. The documents provided show the HSCA actively investigating aspects related to the JFK assassination. This includes requesting information from the NSA regarding Cuban communications during March and April 1962, interviewing individuals like Sgt. Lewis Wesley Leber regarding potential connections to the assassination, and receiving reports from forensic pathology panels. The timeline of involvement spans from at least November 1977 to July 1978, as indicated by journal entries and document dates. A notable pattern is the committee's focus on gathering information from various sources, including government agencies and individuals, to comprehensively investigate the circumstances surrounding the assassination.",
