The documents indicate that the NSA responded to a request from Blakey for Cuban communications related to specific individuals and entities. However, a thorough search yielded negative results due to the destruction of raw traffic data and the lack of product files. The documents also mention HSCA staff payroll records and the Assassination Records Review Board's final determination to postpone in part the release of HSCA staff payroll records, specifically redacting Social Security numbers to protect personal privacy.",
