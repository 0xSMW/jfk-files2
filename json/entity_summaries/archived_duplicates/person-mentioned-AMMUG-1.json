  "summary": "AMMUG-1 appears to be an individual for whom the CIA was attempting to secure a safehouse in Mexico City in May 1964. A specific apartment was initially rejected due to its proximity to KUBARK (CIA) staffers and agent assets, but another apartment was later chosen as a safehouse despite concerns about the address being well-known. The documents suggest that AMMUG-1 was important enough to warrant the allocation of resources for secure housing. Other documents mention operations in Mexico and El Salvador, but it is unclear if they are related to AMMUG-1.",
