Kennedy. These documents encompass a wide range of responses from various countries, including Bulgaria, Iran, France, Syria, Burma, Morocco, Norway, Ghana, Tanganyika (Tanzania), Cuba, South Korea, Finland, Hungary, Tunisia, El Salvador, and the Soviet Union.

The timeline of involvement is primarily concentrated in the period immediately following Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, extending into December 1963. A notable pattern is the widespread expression of grief and shock across different nations, as well as the use of the event as a point of political commentary or comparison.",
