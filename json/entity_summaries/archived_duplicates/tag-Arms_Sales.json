The involvement of individuals like WerBell, with alleged CIA ties and connections to Cuban exiles, raises questions about potential links between arms trafficking, covert operations, and the broader political climate surrounding the assassination. The mention of Soviet representatives in connection with arms sales to Cuba further underscores the geopolitical complexities of the era.",
