  "summary": "Richard Helms was a central figure in the CIA during the period relevant to the JFK assassination and its subsequent investigations. He served as Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and was involved in various foreign policy issues, intelligence operations, and personnel matters. Several documents show Helms corresponding with Sir Charles Spry regarding the declassification of Warren Commission documents, specifically CD-971 and CD-071, assuring Spry that the CIA had no current plans to declassify them based on Spry's recommendations. Helms is also mentioned in connection to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) request for information on individuals and entities of interest, including himself. His name appears in relation to investigations into other CIA personnel, such as William Harvey and James McCord, Jr., and in the context of CIA activities in Mexico aimed at countering Communist influence. He is also mentioned in connection to Yurily Ivanovich Nosenko, a Soviet KGB officer who defected and was confined by the CIA.",
