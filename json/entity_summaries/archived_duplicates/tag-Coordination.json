  "summary": "The documents highlight coordination in various operational contexts. One document discusses Sam Halpern's experience with coordination with the DDI (Deputy Director of Intelligence) during Operation Mongoose, contrasting it with the Bay of Pigs operation. Another document details coordination between DCSI USCOB Berlin and DPSI USAREUR Heidelberg, along with West Berlin police, to apprehend possible US Army deserters, emphasizing the need for swift action and discretion. The third document focuses on coordination between Kammer (likely CIA) and Mr. McCORD of SRS regarding the operational use of Michael Weimer Stratton for propaganda within the US, raising the possibility of FBI involvement. The documents collectively illustrate the importance of coordination in intelligence operations, law enforcement, and propaganda efforts.",
