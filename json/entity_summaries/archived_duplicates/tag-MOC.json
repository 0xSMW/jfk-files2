  "summary": "MOC stands for Memorandum of Oral Commitment. The documents indicate that MOCs were used by the CIA to formalize agreements with individuals, often related to operational activities. These commitments covered terms of engagement, compensation, and specific operational duties. The documents highlight the use of MOCs in the context of covert operations, particularly those involving individuals in Latin America and maritime operations. The documents show that MOCs were amended when changes occurred, such as salary raises, indicating a formal process for managing these agreements. The timeline spans from 1961 to 1965, showing the use of MOCs during this period. A notable pattern is the use of MOCs in the context of JMWAVE operations, suggesting a standard practice within that base.",
