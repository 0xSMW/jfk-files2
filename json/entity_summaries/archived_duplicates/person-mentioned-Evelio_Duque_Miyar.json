  "summary": "Evelio Duque Miyar was a Cuban anti-communist who had past interactions with the CIA. The CIA provided assistance to him at one point but later terminated the relationship due to disagreements over operational control. He was involved in anti-Castro activities and may have had connections to drug trafficking and exile groups. In 1978, he opened a confectionery store across from the consulate in Guayaquil. The Guayaquil station requested traces on him, noting his potential involvement in Cuban operations in the Miami area during the early 1960s. HQ was requested to conduct traces on him, as he was a Cuban subject with a 201 file.",
