  "summary": "Phillip Agee is mentioned in the context of CIA activities in Mexico City. Specifically, his book is referenced in a CIA memorandum requesting reconsideration of certain releases of security classified HSCA testimony of John Scelso. The CIA was concerned about releasing information related to a political action program in Mexico City and liaison with Mexican police, and how Agee's book might relate to that information. The documents do not provide extensive details about Agee's direct involvement in the JFK assassination context, but rather his book is a point of reference in discussions about CIA operations and information disclosure.",

  "significance": "Phillip Agee's significance in the JFK context is indirect. His book is mentioned as a potential source of information related to CIA activities in Mexico City, which were of interest to the HSCA in their investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald's activities and the CIA's knowledge of him before the assassination. The documents suggest that the CIA was concerned about the potential impact of releasing information that might be connected to Agee's published work.",
