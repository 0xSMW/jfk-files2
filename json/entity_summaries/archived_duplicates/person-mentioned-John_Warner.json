  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, there is insufficient information to provide a comprehensive summary about John Warner's role or significance. The documents mention various topics such as congressional reviews of intelligence activities, Rockefeller Commission files, notes for Mr. McCone, materials related to Allen Dulles and the Warren Commission, and Cuban exiles involved with the DEA. However, none of these summaries explicitly detail John Warner's involvement, role, or connections to the JFK assassination or related events. Therefore, it's impossible to determine his significance or timeline of involvement based solely on these document summaries.",
