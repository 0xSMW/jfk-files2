  "summary": "Jimmy Carter is mentioned in these documents primarily in the context of a potential security threat during his visit to Venezuela in 1978. A CIA situation report details concerns about leftist groups, Cuban exiles, and international terrorists potentially posing a risk during his visit. He is also mentioned in documents related to Sergyj Czornonoh's claims about Lee Harvey Oswald, though Carter's direct involvement in that context is not specified. The documents do not suggest any direct involvement of Jimmy Carter in the JFK assassination or related investigations, but rather his name appears in documents covering a range of topics during his presidency.",
