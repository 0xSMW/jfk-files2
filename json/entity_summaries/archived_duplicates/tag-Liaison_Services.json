  "summary": "Liaison services refer to collaborative relationships between intelligence agencies, often involving the sharing of information and coordination of activities. In the context of these documents, liaison services are mentioned in relation to surveillance operations and intelligence sharing. Specifically, the documents highlight instances where the CIA considered alerting or sharing information with allied intelligence agencies (referred to as 'liaison services') regarding Soviet KGB activities and identified Cuban intelligence officers. The documents suggest that these services played a role in broader intelligence efforts, particularly in monitoring and countering Soviet and Cuban intelligence operations during the Cold War era. The documents also show that the CIA was cautious about revealing certain information to liaison services, indicating a degree of selectivity in what was shared.",
