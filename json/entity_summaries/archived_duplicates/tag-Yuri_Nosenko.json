  "summary": "Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko was a KGB defector who provided information to the FBI and CIA. The documents reveal scrutiny surrounding his bona fides, with the FBI comparing CIA assessments of Nosenko's credibility against information from other defectors and finding deficiencies. Nosenko was interviewed by the FBI in 1964 regarding various cases, including American tourists and priests in Moscow, potential KGB recruitments, and Soviet intelligence operations. He testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1978, providing insights into Lee Harvey Oswald's time in the Soviet Union and the KGB's alleged lack of interest in him. The documents highlight ongoing investigations and debates regarding the veracity and completeness of Nosenko's information, particularly in relation to the JFK assassination.",
