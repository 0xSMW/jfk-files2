  "summary": "Evelio Duque Miyar was a Cuban anti-communist who had past interactions with the CIA. The CIA provided him with assistance at one point but later terminated the relationship due to disagreements over operational control. In 1978, he opened a confectionery store across from the U.S. consulate in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The Guayaquil station requested traces on him, as he may have been involved in Cuban operations in the Miami area during the early 1960s. The station reported having no operational interest in him at the time.",
