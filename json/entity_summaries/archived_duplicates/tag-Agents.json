  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the mention of agents is significant because it highlights the CIA's use of covert operatives and their potential involvement in events surrounding the assassination. The documents suggest that agents were involved in various clandestine activities, including intelligence gathering and potentially more sensitive operations. The reference to the HSCA and interviews with agents indicates that the committee was interested in exploring the potential role of CIA agents in the assassination. However, the documents do not provide direct evidence of agent involvement in the assassination itself.",
