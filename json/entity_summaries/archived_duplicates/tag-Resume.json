  "summary": "The documents reference resumes of individuals connected to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and one individual seeking employment due to the Cuban political situation. These resumes are part of HSCA staff payroll records and personal data files. Specifically, the resumes belong to Joseph Kiel, Sheryl Lynn Bonifer, and Claire L. Brown, who were all employed by the HSCA. Additionally, there is a resume for Emilio A. Rodriguez, created in 1959, unrelated to the HSCA. The Assassination Records Review Board reviewed these documents and made determinations regarding the release of personal information, such as Social Security numbers, often postponing their release to protect personal privacy. The resumes provide insights into the qualifications and backgrounds of individuals involved in the HSCA's investigation.",
