  "summary": "Manuel Ray was a Cuban exile leader who played a significant role in anti-Castro activities. The documents indicate that he replaced Miro Cardona as the leader of Cuban exiles, allegedly with the backing of the United States, as reported in a Miami Herald article in 1962. CIA documents discuss this event and the resulting furor within the Cuban community, including plans to discredit the story and reassure Miro Cardona. A collection of documents from 1960 to 1978 focuses on Ray, covering CIA's interactions with him, assessments of his anti-Castro activities, and his relationships with other Cuban exile figures and organizations.",

  "significance": "The documents suggest that Manuel Ray was a key figure in the Cuban exile community and had connections to the CIA. His role as a leader of anti-Castro activities and his alleged replacement of Miro Cardona with U.S. backing are points of interest. The documents do not directly link him to the JFK assassination, but his involvement in the Cuban exile movement places him within the broader context of individuals and groups potentially involved or investigated in connection to the assassination.",
