  "summary": "Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko was a Soviet KGB officer who defected to the United States in 1964. Following his defection, the CIA subjected him to intense scrutiny and confinement to determine the veracity of his claims and whether he was a genuine defector or a plant by the KGB. The investigation involved interviews, polygraph tests, and analysis of his background, KGB career, and motivations. The documents reveal concerns about his bona fides and the possibility that he was dispatched by the KGB. Discussions with the Department of Justice and legal justifications for his confinement are also documented. The House Select Committee on Assassinations reviewed materials related to Nosenko's case.",
