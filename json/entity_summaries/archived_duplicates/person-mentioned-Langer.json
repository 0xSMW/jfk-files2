  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, it's difficult to ascertain the specific identity or role of \"Langer\" within the context of the JFK assassination or related intelligence matters. The documents primarily consist of meeting minutes and agendas from the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) between 1962 and 1964. While these meetings covered a range of intelligence activities, including discussions on Cuba, Soviet activities, and covert operations, the documents do not provide enough context to determine who \"Langer\" is or their specific involvement. Without additional information, it's impossible to provide a comprehensive summary of Langer's role or significance.",
