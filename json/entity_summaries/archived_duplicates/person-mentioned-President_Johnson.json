  "summary": "President Lyndon B. Johnson is mentioned in several documents related to the JFK assassination and its aftermath. Following President Kennedy's assassination, Johnson assumed the presidency, which had immediate implications for U.S. foreign policy and relations with countries like Cuba and France. Some documents reflect concerns about the potential for a stolen Warren Commission document being used to prejudice Johnson. The Cuban government, under Fidel Castro, reportedly adjusted its policy to avoid irritating Johnson, hoping for improved relations. The documents also reveal that President Johnson's administration continued Kennedy's foreign policies, impacting relations with France. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) also interacted with the Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) Library in their efforts to locate and declassify relevant materials. Overall, the documents portray Johnson as a central figure in the immediate aftermath of the assassination, whose actions and policies were closely observed and analyzed by various entities, including foreign governments and intelligence agencies.",
