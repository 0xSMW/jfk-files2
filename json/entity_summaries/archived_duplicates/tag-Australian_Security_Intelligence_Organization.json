  "summary": "The Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) is mentioned in the context of the declassification of Warren Commission documents related to the JFK assassination. Specifically, Sir Charles Spry of ASIO provided recommendations regarding the declassification of documents CD-971 and CD-071. In the case of CD-971, which pertains to an investigation of anonymous telephone calls to the Canberra Embassy before and after President Kennedy's assassination, Spry initially recommended against declassification. Richard Helms of the CIA acknowledged and respected Spry's recommendation, assuring him that the CIA had no current plans to declassify the document. The documents suggest a collaborative relationship between ASIO and the CIA regarding the handling of sensitive information related to the JFK assassination investigation.",
