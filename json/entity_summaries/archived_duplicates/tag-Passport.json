While the documents do not directly link passports to the assassination, they highlight the use of passports in activities that could be related to intelligence gathering, clandestine operations, or the movement of individuals of interest. The documents suggest that passports were a tool used to facilitate travel and conceal identities, which could be relevant to understanding the movements and activities of individuals potentially connected to the assassination.",
