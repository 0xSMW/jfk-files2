  "summary": "Commercial cover refers to the use of commercial entities or employment as a disguise or means of support for intelligence operations. The documents indicate that commercial cover was used to facilitate intelligence gathering and operational activities. For example, ICAP Iberia, S.A. was considered for exploitation by the Madrid Station, and Lykes Steamship Company provided cover for CIA employees. Additionally, the possibility of recruiting Oleg M. Nechiporenko under commercial cover was explored. These instances highlight the CIA's use of commercial entities to mask the true nature of their activities and personnel.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, commercial cover is relevant as it represents a method by which intelligence agencies could potentially conceal their involvement in various activities, including those related to individuals or organizations connected to the assassination. The use of commercial entities provides a layer of deniability and makes it more difficult to trace the true nature of operations.",
