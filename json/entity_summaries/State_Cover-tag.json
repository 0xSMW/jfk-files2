  "summary": "State Cover refers to the practice of CIA employees operating under the guise of being State Department employees. The JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was investigating the CIA's use of State Cover, leading to concerns within the CIA about the potential damage to operations and relationships with liaison services if this practice was officially acknowledged. The CIA sought assessments from various stations (Moscow, Paris, Mexico City, Buenos Aires) regarding the potential fallout from releasing documents confirming the use of State Department cover. The ARRB meetings in November 1997 and January 1998 discussed the release of information related to CIA employees under State cover. The CIA was particularly concerned about security risks to station officers, potential exploitation by hostile intelligence services, and the impact on ongoing operations if the use of State Cover was revealed.",
