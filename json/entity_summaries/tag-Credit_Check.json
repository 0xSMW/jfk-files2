  "summary": "Credit checks were used by the CIA for various purposes, including vetting potential agents and providing cover for operations. One document mentions a search for credit records of Manuel Marti, which yielded negative results from two credit agencies in New York City. Another document outlines a proposal to change the policy for processing potential REDSKIN agents, which included using a nonofficial cover for A&E assessments and credit checks on staff members. A third document discusses employment cover and credit checks for AMMUG/1, who used the Inter-University Committee for Political and Social Action (IUCPSA) as a cover and was attempting to purchase a house. The documents highlight the CIA's use of credit checks as a tool for verifying information, assessing risk, and maintaining operational security.",
