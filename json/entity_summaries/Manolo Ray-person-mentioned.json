  "summary": "Manolo Ray was a Cuban exile leader, specifically associated with the Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP), also known as the People's Revolutionary Movement. The documents indicate that Ray was active in the early 1960s, particularly around 1961. He opposed a U.S. invasion of Cuba, advocating instead for internal resistance supported by a broad base within Cuba. He sought funds and trained exiles to support this internal resistance. The documents also mention his statements being relayed through British intelligence services. There is a reference to \"Natolo Ray's training efforts in Costa Rica\", which may or may not be the same person, but it is mentioned in the context of potential KUBARK involvement. The documents also reference discussions about covert operations related to Cuba, including the use of exile groups, which may involve Ray's organization.",

  "significance": "Manolo Ray's significance in the JFK assassination context is indirect. The documents suggest he was a key figure in anti-Castro activities and exile groups, which were of interest to the CIA. While the documents do not directly link him to the assassination, his involvement in these groups places him within the broader network of individuals and organizations involved in covert operations against Cuba, some of whom have been subjects of speculation and investigation related to the assassination.",
