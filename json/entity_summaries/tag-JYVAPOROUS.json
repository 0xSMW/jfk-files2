The Records Review Board sought access to JYVAPOROUS, who responded positively to an embassy note. JYVAPOROUS/1 visited headquarters in July 1993, where discussions included Lee Harvey Oswald files and potential joint operations. In 1995, Minsk sought guidance on whether to question JYVAPOROUS about sharing Oswald files with Norman Mailer, reflecting US government concerns. The documents indicate a sustained interest in JYVAPOROUS as a potential source of information regarding Oswald's time in Minsk and the availability of relevant records.",
