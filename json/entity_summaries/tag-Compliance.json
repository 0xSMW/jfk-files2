  "summary": "In the context of the JFK assassination records, \"Compliance\" refers to the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) adherence to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) played a crucial role in overseeing and requesting information from the CIA to ensure compliance with the Act. The documents highlight the ARRB's efforts to locate, review, and declassify relevant materials, as well as interactions with the CIA regarding search completeness and access to CIA files. The timeline spans from 1995 to 1997, reflecting the period when the ARRB actively sought information and records from the CIA. A notable pattern across the documents is the repeated requests from the ARRB for additional information, records, and compliance statements from the CIA, indicating ongoing scrutiny and efforts to ensure full compliance with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act.",
