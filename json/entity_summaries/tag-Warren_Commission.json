  "summary": "The Warren Commission, officially known as the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, was established to investigate the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963. The documents reveal the CIA's interactions with the Warren Commission, including providing information on Lee Harvey Oswald's activities, particularly his time in the Soviet Union and contacts with the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City. The CIA also addressed questions and concerns raised by the Commission and critics regarding Oswald's background and potential connections. Some documents discuss the declassification of Warren Commission documents and the concerns raised by foreign intelligence agencies, such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), regarding the release of certain information. The documents also highlight the NSA's role in providing information to the Warren Commission and later to congressional committees investigating the assassination. Overall, the documents illustrate the complex relationship between the Warren Commission and various government agencies, particularly the CIA and NSA, in the investigation of President Kennedy's assassination.",
