  "summary": "Rolando Masferrer Rojas was a Cuban exile involved in activities against both Haiti and Cuba during the mid-1960s. The documents suggest that he was a significant figure in anti-Castro efforts, with potential CIA connections. There are indications of plots against Haiti and Cuba, and internal discussions within the CIA regarding the legal implications of indicting Masferrer due to his claims of U.S. government backing. The documents span from 1964 to 1966, highlighting a period of intense activity. A notable pattern is the recurring theme of Masferrer's involvement in covert operations and the legal and ethical considerations surrounding his actions.",
