  "summary": "Helsinki is mentioned in the context of Lee Harvey Oswald's stay in October 1959, specifically his contact with the Soviet Consulate there. CIA records and memos discuss the timeline of Oswald's visit and the inquiries made by the Warren Commission. Additionally, Helsinki is referenced as a transit point for a source (AELADLE) in May 1961 who was later interrogated by the KGB in Moscow about contacts with the KGB Legal Residency in Helsinki. The documents suggest that Helsinki was a location of interest for intelligence activities and a point of contact between individuals and Soviet entities during the Cold War period relevant to the JFK assassination investigation.",
