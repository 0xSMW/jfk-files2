  "significance": "Sukarno's significance in the JFK assassination context is primarily related to the fact that he ordered Indonesian police officials to travel to the U.S. to investigate the assassination. This suggests an interest or concern on his part regarding the event. However, the documents do not provide any direct evidence linking Sukarno to the assassination itself. His connections to individuals like William Leonard Oltmans, who testified about George de Mohrenschildt's link to Lee Harvey Oswald, could be considered tangentially relevant.",
