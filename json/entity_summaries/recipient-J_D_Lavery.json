  "summary": "J. D. Lavery is identified as the recipient of multiple memoranda concerning the classification of a document labeled EX 3600. These memoranda, all dated April 7, 1977, were routed through A. Addona and originated from P. Haefner (or J. Haffner in one instance). The subject of these memos, EX 3600, is classified due to its connection to Operation MHCHAOS and the inclusion of information from sensitive sources, classified FBI reports, and sensitive methods. Lavery's role appears to be within the Office of General Counsel (OGC), as indicated in one memo, suggesting a legal or advisory capacity regarding document classification and potential FOIA exemptions.",

  "significance": "J. D. Lavery's significance in the JFK assassination context is indirect. The documents suggest Lavery was involved in decisions regarding the classification of documents related to Operation MHCHAOS, which itself has connections to CIA activities during the JFK era. The classification of EX 3600 and its link to MHCHAOS indicates Lavery's role in controlling access to information potentially relevant to understanding the historical context surrounding the assassination.",
