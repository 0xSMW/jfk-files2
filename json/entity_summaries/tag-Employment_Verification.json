  "summary": "Employment verification appears in the documents as a process of confirming an individual's work history, often involving checking payroll records, contacting previous employers, or reviewing identification forms. In the context of these documents, employment verification is used to establish the background and activities of individuals like I. Charles Mathews and Manuel Marti. The documents include payroll records for Mathews from his time with the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), and verification of Marti's employment history at Mutual Insurance Advisory Association and Polly Perry Stores. These verifications are likely conducted to assess the individuals' backgrounds and potential connections relevant to investigations or inquiries, possibly related to the JFK assassination.",
