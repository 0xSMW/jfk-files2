  "summary": "Richard Gibson is identified as a person of interest in the context of the JFK assassination records. He is mentioned in connection to Lee Harvey Oswald's (LHO) activities, associations, and potential liaison with the CIA. Gibson is also linked to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). A CIA message from 1964 reports on the magazine 'Revolution' denouncing Gibson, a former secretary of the 'Fair Play for Cuba Committee,' for allegedly infiltrating the international revolutionary movement. Later documents from 1998 refer to him as a CIA asset and discuss the protection of information related to him (and LITAMIL-9) during the ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board) review process. The documents suggest that the CIA was concerned about protecting information related to Gibson and his activities.",
