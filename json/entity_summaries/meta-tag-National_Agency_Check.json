  "summary": "National Agency Checks (NACs), also referred to as background checks or security checks, are investigations conducted by U.S. government agencies like the CIA, Department of Defense (DOD), and U.S. Army to assess an individual's suitability for employment, security clearances, or other sensitive positions. These checks involve gathering information about a person's personal history, including residences, employment, education, foreign connections, and potential vulnerabilities. The process includes querying local law enforcement agencies (Local Agency Check) and other relevant sources for information. These checks were initiated for various reasons, including employment suitability, security clearances, name changes, affiliations with specific organizations, or requests from other agencies. Individuals like Manuel Marti, Edward Kaczmarczyk, Robert Scheer, and David Reed Fromer were subjected to NACs, with some refusing to complete certain forms. The checks aimed to uncover any existing records, derogatory information, or associations that might be relevant to investigations, ensuring compliance with updated requirements and mitigating risks associated with classified information or agency connections.",
