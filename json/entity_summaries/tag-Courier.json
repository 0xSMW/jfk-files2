  "summary": "The documents identify 'courier' as a role individuals played in transmitting materials, often related to intelligence operations. Ismael Rodriguez, a comptroller for Cubana Airlines, was used by the CIA as a courier for transmitting material between the U.S. and Cuba. In another instance, AMTOAD-1 attempted to use AMLACE-1's wife as a courier for anti-Castro reports from Havana. The documents highlight the use of couriers in clandestine activities, specifically in the context of U.S.-Cuba relations and intelligence gathering. The timeline spans from 1958 to 1962, indicating the use of couriers during the pre-Bay of Pigs era and the early years of the Kennedy administration. A notable pattern is the association of couriers with the CIA and anti-Castro activities.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the use of couriers highlights the clandestine operations and intelligence networks active during the period leading up to the assassination. While the documents do not directly link couriers to the assassination, they illustrate the environment of covert activities and information transfer that existed, which could be relevant in understanding the broader context of the events surrounding the assassination.",
