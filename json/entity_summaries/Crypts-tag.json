  "summary": "The term \"Crypts\" in these documents refers to cryptographic systems or codes used by the CIA. The documents highlight concerns about the potential release of classified information that could compromise these crypts. Specifically, the documents show the CIA's apprehension about releasing information related to overseas stations and the need to protect sensitive relationships and ongoing projects. The Copenhagen station cables emphasize the need to delete crypts from documents related to Lee Harvey Oswald before release, indicating a concern that revealing these crypts could expose sensitive intelligence methods or sources. The ARRB meeting results also mention CIA requests concerning crypts, suggesting ongoing negotiations and decisions regarding the declassification and release of information related to these cryptographic systems.",

  "significance": "In the JFK assassination context, the significance of \"Crypts\" lies in the potential exposure of CIA's intelligence gathering methods and sources if these cryptographic systems were to be revealed. The documents suggest that protecting these crypts was a priority for the CIA, as their compromise could have significant repercussions for ongoing operations and relationships with foreign entities. The redaction or deletion of crypts from documents related to Lee Harvey Oswald indicates a specific concern about the potential link between these cryptographic systems and the events surrounding the assassination.",
