  "summary": "Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto was a Mexican diplomat suspected by the CIA of having ties to the Soviet Union and involvement in financing Communist activities. In 1961, the CIA sought permission from the FBI to share information about him with German authorities (Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz - BFV). However, the FBI responded that their files did not support the claim that Espinosa y Prieto knowingly financed communist activities and advised against including this allegation in the summary provided to the BFV. The documents suggest a period of scrutiny around Espinosa y Prieto in the early 1960s regarding potential connections to communist activities.",
