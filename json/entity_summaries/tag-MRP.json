  "summary": "The Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP), or People's Revolutionary Movement, was a Cuban exile organization active in the early 1960s. Led by Manolo Ray, the MRP advocated for internal resistance against the Castro regime in Cuba, rather than a direct U.S. invasion. Documents indicate the CIA monitored the MRP's activities, including planned uprisings and Ray's statements regarding the organization's goals and opposition to a U.S. invasion. The MRP sought funds and trained exiles to support their internal resistance efforts. The CIA also explored options to penetrate and disrupt anti-Castro groups, including the MRP.",

  "significance": "The MRP's significance in the JFK assassination context is indirect. The documents primarily relate to the CIA's monitoring and potential disruption of anti-Castro groups, including the MRP, in the early 1960s. While these activities reflect the broader context of U.S.-Cuban relations and anti-Castro efforts during that period, the provided documents do not directly link the MRP to the JFK assassination.",
