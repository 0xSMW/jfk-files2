  "summary": "The documents refer to safe houses in the context of CIA operations. One document mentions SR safe houses being used for training and assessment of REDSKIN agent candidates outside of Washington, D.C. This suggests that safe houses were secure locations used for sensitive activities such as agent training and debriefing. Another document mentions the handling of a Soviet defector, implying the use of safe houses for temporary accommodation or secure transit during defection operations. The third document does not explicitly mention safe houses, but details a meeting between individuals discussing various operations and contacts, which could indirectly relate to the use of safe houses for clandestine meetings or operational planning. The documents suggest that safe houses were a standard component of CIA operations during the Cold War era, providing secure locations for various activities.",

The use of safe houses for clandestine activities highlights the agency's capacity for covert operations, which is relevant to understanding the broader context of the JFK assassination and potential CIA involvement.",
