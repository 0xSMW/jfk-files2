  "summary": "The documents mention Ambassador YOST in the context of Cambodian-U.S. relations following President Kennedy's assassination. Specifically, Cambodia demanded apologies from American ambassadors, including YOST, for statements made about Cambodia. This demand was part of a larger set of conditions Cambodia set for resolving a dispute with the U.S. through Philippine mediation. The documents also highlight Washington's concern over a Cambodian broadcast that appeared to celebrate the deaths of perceived enemies, possibly including President Kennedy, which led to diplomatic actions. Cambodia later clarified that while they mourned Kennedy's death, their joy stemmed from liberation from threats posed by Ngo Dinh Diem and Sarit Thanarat.",
