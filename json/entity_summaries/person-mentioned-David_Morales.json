  "summary": "David Morales is identified as a person for whom alias documents were transferred within the CIA. A 1973 memorandum details the transfer of his alias documents, including identification cards and a Mexican passport, from Foreign Resources (FR) Plans Chief Robert Baker to WH/Security. While the documents don't explicitly state Morales' role in the JFK assassination, the context of these documents, which are related to the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) and the release of JFK assassination-related records, suggests that information about Morales is considered relevant to the JFK assassination investigation. The documents highlight the CIA's concern over releasing alias documentation, indicating a potential sensitivity surrounding Morales' activities and identity.",

  "significance": "The significance of David Morales in the JFK context stems from the CIA's handling of his alias documentation and the ARRB's interest in these records. The CIA's reluctance to release alias documentation in general, and specifically the existence of alias documents for Morales, suggests a potential connection to covert operations or sensitive activities that the CIA wished to keep secret. The documents imply that information about Morales is relevant to understanding events surrounding the JFK assassination.",
