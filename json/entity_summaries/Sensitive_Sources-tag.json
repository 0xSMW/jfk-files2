  "summary": "The term \"Sensitive Sources\" appears in the context of classifying document EX 3600, which is related to Operation MHCHAOS. The classification is justified because the document contains information obtained from sensitive sources and methods, as well as classified FBI reports. The documents indicate that the use of these sensitive sources is a key reason for maintaining the confidentiality of the information. The classification is deemed necessary to protect the sources and methods used to acquire the information.",
