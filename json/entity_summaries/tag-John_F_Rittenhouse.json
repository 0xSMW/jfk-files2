  "summary": "John F. Rittenhouse was associated with the CIA's Overseas Branch (OPC). In late 1950, there were plans to change his status from OPC Staff Employee to OPC Staff Agent and assign him to Mexico City as a GS-13 Intelligence Officer under State Department deep cover. This assignment was under security concurrence. However, shortly after, his security clearance was canceled, and he was reclassified as a semi-covert employee integrated into a department. The documents suggest a change in plans regarding Rittenhouse's role and assignment within the CIA during this period.",
