  "summary": "The documents reveal terrorism as a significant concern, particularly in the context of Cuban exiles, Viet Cong activities, and potential threats to U.S. interests. Several documents highlight the activities of Cuban exiles like Orlando Bosch, who is linked to bombings and anti-Castro operations. The documents also mention potential terrorist threats during President Carter's visit to Venezuela and Viet Cong plans to increase terrorist activities targeting Americans in Saigon. There are also allegations of Castro's involvement in financing terrorist acts. The documents span from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, indicating a sustained concern about terrorism across different geopolitical contexts. A notable pattern is the focus on Cuban exile groups and their activities, as well as the potential for these activities to impact U.S. foreign policy and security.",

  "significance": "While not directly linked to the JFK assassination in most documents, terrorism appears as a backdrop against which U.S. foreign policy and intelligence operations were conducted. One document references Georgi Enerovich Mamedov's views on the Kennedy assassination and mob activities, suggesting a tangential connection. The broader context of Cuban exile activities and anti-Castro sentiment, which are linked to terrorism in these documents, are relevant to understanding potential motives and actors involved in the JFK assassination.",
