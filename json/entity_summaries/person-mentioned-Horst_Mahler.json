  "summary": "Horst Mahler is mentioned in three documents. The documents do not provide specific details about Horst Mahler's role or activities related to the JFK assassination. The documents are dated 1967 and 1970. One document discusses possible US Army deserters in West Berlin, while the other two concern a CIA watch list of individuals who might pose a security threat to the President during a European trip. The documents suggest that Horst Mahler was on a CIA watch list in 1970, possibly due to concerns about security threats during a presidential trip to Europe. The documents do not provide enough information to determine the exact nature of the threat or Mahler's involvement.",
