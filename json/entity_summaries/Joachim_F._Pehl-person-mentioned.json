  "summary": "Joachim F. Pehl, also known as Joachim S. Beer, is the step-son of Henry S. Beer. Agent reports from March 1971 detail derogatory information found on Joachim, including reports of a fire and disturbing the peace while he served in the US Army Berlin Brigade. Local agency checks revealed similar derogatory information from the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO) regarding these incidents. A cable from BLN STA 66th MI GP, also from March 1971, indicates that LAC's and MAC's checks on Joachim were mostly negative or non-derogatory, except for the disturbing the peace incident. The cable also details Joachim Raf. Beer's background as a former labor service employee and his immigration processing.",
