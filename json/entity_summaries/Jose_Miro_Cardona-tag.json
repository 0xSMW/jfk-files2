He is mentioned in the context of the Cuban Revolutionary Council, where his potential resignation reflected growing frustration among Cuban exiles regarding U.S. policy towards Cuba. Cardona was also involved in communications and planning related to anti-Castro actions, as evidenced by his connection to Miguel Ydigoras-Fuentes and Carlos Alejos regarding activities against Fidel Castro. His role suggests a central figure in coordinating and potentially leading efforts to undermine the Castro regime, reflecting the intense political climate and covert operations surrounding Cuba during the early 1960s.",
