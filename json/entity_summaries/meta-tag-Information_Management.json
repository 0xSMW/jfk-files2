  "summary": "Information Management within the CIA, encompassing file and records management and indexing, is crucial for organizing, tracking, and controlling access to information related to its operations and individuals of interest. The CIA's practices, including the '201 system,' involve creating and maintaining dossiers, assigning codes, and generating lists for tracking individuals. These systems and procedures are essential for operational security, accountability, and compliance with information requests, particularly those related to the JFK assassination. The emphasis is on standardized procedures, secure storage, and controlled access to sensitive information, with ongoing efforts to refine these practices from the early 1960s through the late 1990s.",
