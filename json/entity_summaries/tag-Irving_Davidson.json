He acted as a conduit for communications between the Haitian government and U.S. entities, including the U.S. government.

He was also involved in arms deals and casino ventures. The timeline of his involvement spans from at least 1958 to 1963, with a concentration of activity in December 1963, coinciding with the JFK assassination.",

The documents suggest he was involved in sensitive diplomatic communications and potentially other activities that could be of interest in understanding the broader geopolitical landscape surrounding the event. His connections to Duvalier's government, known for its controversial practices, and his involvement in arms deals, raise questions about potential connections to other actors or events related to the assassination.",
