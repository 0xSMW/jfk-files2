  "summary": "The documents highlight the significance of files held by various organizations, particularly the CIA, in the context of the JFK assassination investigation. These files contain information on individuals, entities, and events related to the assassination, and were actively sought after by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The files include details on individuals of interest, such as Luis Posada Carriles, George DeMohrenschildt, and Lee Harvey Oswald, as well as organizations like the International Rescue Committee and the Wackenhut Corporation. The timeline spans from the 1960s (Oswald's time in the Soviet Union) to the late 1970s (HSCA investigations) and even the 1990s (concerns about access to Oswald's files). A notable pattern is the HSCA's persistent requests for access to CIA files to investigate potential connections and gather information relevant to the assassination.",
