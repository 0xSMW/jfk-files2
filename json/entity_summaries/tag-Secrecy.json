  "summary": "The documents highlight the CIA's consistent efforts to maintain secrecy regarding its operations, personnel, and relationships, particularly in the context of the JFK assassination records and other sensitive activities. This includes protecting the identities of human intelligence sources, concealing CIA involvement in operations like the Glomar Explorer and activities involving weapons caches in Austria, and using cover organizations to mask the agency's role. The emphasis on secrecy stems from concerns about personal safety, the integrity of ongoing operations, and the protection of relationships with individuals and organizations providing cover. The documents span from 1955 to 1996, indicating a long-standing practice of prioritizing secrecy within the CIA.",
