  "summary": "The documents suggest that 'Washington (EUR/BNL)' was a recipient of intelligence reports from Brussels concerning the 'Flemish Order of Militants' (VMO). The documents indicate that Washington sought information on the VMO, specifically regarding potential connections between the VMO and American citizens. However, NITRUST, a liaison contact, was reluctant to share information with the House Committee on Assassinations due to concerns about the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and potential leaks. Ultimately, NIGALE declined to prepare a report for the House Committee due to a lack of information on VMO-American citizen contacts between 1968 and 1970. The documents highlight a request for information and subsequent difficulties in obtaining it, suggesting Washington's interest in the VMO within the context of the JFK assassination investigation.",
