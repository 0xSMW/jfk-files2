  "summary": "Jack Ruby is identified as the individual who killed Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President John F. Kennedy. The Warren Commission concluded that Ruby acted alone, possibly driven by personal motivations and mental instability. CIA documents indicate that the agency had information on Ruby, and the Warren Commission sought information from the CIA regarding him. Samuel Ruby, likely a relative, sent his tax returns to the HSCA. The documents consistently portray Jack Ruby as a key figure directly connected to the aftermath of President Kennedy's assassination due to his killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.",
