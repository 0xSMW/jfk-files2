  "summary": "Sir Charles C. F. Spry is the recipient of multiple letters from Richard Helms, the Director of Central Intelligence, all dated November 26, 1968. These letters concern the potential declassification of Warren Commission documents, specifically CD-971 and CD-071. Helms assures Spry that the CIA has no current plans to declassify these documents, citing Spry's recommendation against their release and the absence of public pressure for their declassification. This suggests that Spry held a position that allowed him to influence the CIA's decision regarding the declassification of sensitive information related to the Warren Commission report.",
