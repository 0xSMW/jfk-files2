  "summary": "Economic warfare, as depicted in the provided documents, refers to a component of the CIA's covert operations against Cuba, particularly during the early 1960s. These operations aimed to destabilize the Cuban regime under Fidel Castro through economic pressure, alongside intelligence gathering, psychological warfare, and potential support for internal resistance. The plans involved isolating and discrediting the Castro regime by maintaining economic and political pressures. These actions were part of a broader strategy to undermine the Cuban government and were detailed in operational plans and memoranda within the Cuba Project. The timeline of involvement is primarily focused on the period following the Cuban Missile Crisis, specifically around late 1962, as the CIA adjusted its strategies in the post-crisis environment.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, while these documents do not directly link economic warfare to the assassination itself, they highlight the intense focus and resources dedicated to destabilizing the Cuban government during the Kennedy administration. This context is relevant because theories surrounding the assassination often involve potential motives from parties affected by U.S. policies towards Cuba, including the Cuban government itself or anti-Castro exiles. The economic warfare efforts contribute to understanding the complex web of relationships and tensions surrounding Cuba at the time.",
