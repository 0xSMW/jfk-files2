  "summary": "Bell is mentioned in the context of CIA activities related to anti-Castro Cuban groups and individuals. The documents suggest Bell was involved in facilitating logistical support for agents being dispatched to Cuba in early 1961. Specifically, a classified message from Mexico City to Bell requests a fifth PO Box and advises on efforts to obtain three more, indicating a role in providing accommodation addresses for agents operating in the Mexico area. The documents do not provide a full name or further details about Bell's specific role or connections beyond this logistical support.",
