  "summary": "Sukarno was the President of Indonesia during the period covered by these documents. His significance within the JFK assassination context is indirect but notable. He ordered Indonesian police officials to the U.S. to investigate the assassination of President Kennedy. He is also mentioned in connection to Dutch journalist William Leonard Oltmans, who allegedly had intimate relationships with Indonesians, including Sukarno. Additionally, Sukarno was the target of a CIA project (HARPSTAR) aimed at influencing him through a female asset. A propaganda film intended to discredit Sukarno was also mentioned in the testimony of Samuel Halpern. The documents suggest that Sukarno was a figure of interest to the CIA, both as a target for influence operations and in the context of international political events during the Kennedy era.",
