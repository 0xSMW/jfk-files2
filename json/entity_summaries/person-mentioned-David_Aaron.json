One document from September 29, 1975, lists him as a staff personnel certified by the Staff Director/Senate Select Committee as meeting security clearance requirements up to TOP SECRET, including those briefed under DCID 1/14. He is also mentioned in transcripts from Senate Select Committee hearings in March 1976. These hearings discuss proposed restrictions on the CIA's operational use of academics and grantees, as well as the covert use of media and academics by the CIA. The documents suggest that David Aaron was involved in governmental operations related to intelligence activities and held a high-level security clearance.",
