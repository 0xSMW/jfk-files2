  "summary": "AMWHIP-1 is a tag associated with individuals involved in covert CIA operations, particularly during the 1963-1966 period. AMWHIP-1 appears to have been a long-time CIA asset with ties to the Perumen regime. Activities included supporting operations in Rome, facilitating contacts, and assessing individuals for operational placement. Specific instances include involvement with the KUBARK program, travel to Europe (Paris, Geneva, Rome), and connections to the AMLASH operation involving Rolando CUBELA Secades. AMWHIP-1 was also involved in addressing concerns and finding solutions to integrate individuals with potentially problematic backgrounds into sensitive operations, such as the placement of AMBUNNY-1 with UNSNAFU-19 in Paris.",
