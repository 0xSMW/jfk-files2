  "summary": "Washington_(EURBNL), representing elements of the U.S. government including the intelligence community and the House of Representatives, sought intelligence from Brussels regarding the Flemish Order of Militants (VMO) between 1968 and 1970. This interest appears connected to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigation into the JFK assassination, specifically concerning potential links between the VMO and American citizens. However, European intelligence sources, such as NITRUST and NIGALE, were hesitant to share information due to concerns about potential leaks and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), ultimately leading to a reluctance to prepare a report for the House of Representatives Committee.",
