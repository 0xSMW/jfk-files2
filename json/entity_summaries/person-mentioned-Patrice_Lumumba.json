  "summary": "Patrice Lumumba was the first Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The documents reveal that the CIA explored the possibility of assassinating Lumumba in the early 1960s. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSCIA) investigated the CIA's involvement in plots to assassinate foreign leaders, including Lumumba. The documents include testimonies, reports, and index cards detailing the CIA's activities, potential methods, and individuals involved in the Lumumba assassination plan. The reports suggest that the CIA considered using lethal biological agents and that the plans may have been authorized at high levels within the US government, possibly by President Eisenhower. The documents highlight the CIA's covert actions and the extent of authorization for these operations.",
