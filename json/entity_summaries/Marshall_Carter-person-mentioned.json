  "summary": "Marshall Carter appears in three documents. In a January 30, 1964, meeting of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), Carter was present, as indicated by the minutes. The second document, dated September 25, 1964, is an FBI memorandum regarding the attack on the Spanish vessel Sierra Aranzazu by the Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR), an anti-Castro exile group receiving U.S. backing. While Carter is not directly mentioned in the summary, the document's context suggests potential involvement of individuals connected to intelligence activities. The third document, dated April 8, 1998, outlines pending ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board) issues for an EXDIR (Executive Director) information brief, covering topics such as covert actions, alias documentation, organizational materials, Mexico City tapes, a CIA penetration of the Cuban Embassy (LITAMIL-9), and a CIA asset named Richard Gibson. Again, Carter is not directly mentioned, but the document's subject matter relates to topics the ARRB was investigating, which could potentially involve individuals connected to intelligence activities.",
