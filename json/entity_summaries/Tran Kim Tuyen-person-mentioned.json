By mid-March 1963, opposition groups were seeking American support to overthrow the Diem regime. In July 1963, Tuyen's group was reportedly planning a coup d'état against President Diem and the Ngô Đình Nhu brothers, scheduled shortly after July 20, 1963. The documents suggest Tuyen was involved in plotting against the Diem regime and exploring intelligence operations in Southeast Asia.",
