  "summary": "Index Searches, specifically Index Search and 201 Consolidation Requests, are procedures used to locate and consolidate information on individuals, surnames, or topics within the CIA's indexing system. These requests involve searching for records and files pertaining to a specific subject and, if found, consolidating the information into a single file or updating an existing one. The documents provided show index searches being conducted for individuals like Howard Davis, surnames like Vanderbilt, and figures connected to the JFK assassination such as James Earl Ray, Guy Bannister, and Victor Dominado Espinosa-Hernandez. These searches often involve various files and record centers, including INS reports and State Department telexes. The documents highlight the CIA's systematic approach to gathering and organizing information, particularly in the context of investigations or intelligence gathering.",
