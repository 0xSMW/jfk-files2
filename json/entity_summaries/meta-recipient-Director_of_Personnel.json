  "summary": "The Director of Personnel, also referred to as the Office of Personnel, served as a central recipient and point of contact for various CIA personnel-related actions and records from 1951 to 1979. This office managed a wide range of personnel matters, including security clearances (e.g., Myroslaw Andrew Maksymiec), reassignments, promotions, commendations, resignations, leaves of absence, retirements (e.g., James S. Woods, David E. Murphy), fitness reports (e.g., George Joannides), and alias identification cards (e.g., Harold F. Safley). The office processed actions for employees stationed both domestically and internationally, including locations like Mexico City, Bangkok, and Paris, indicating a significant role in the administrative management of CIA staff throughout this period. While no direct involvement in the JFK assassination is indicated, the office's management of personnel files, including those of individuals with tangential connections (e.g., George Joannides's work with the HSCA), suggests a potential indirect link.",
