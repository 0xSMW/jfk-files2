  "summary": "Intelligence briefings appear in the documents as a means of conveying important information to key decision-makers. They are mentioned in the context of the Vietnam Task Force in 1961, where intelligence briefings were part of the discussions. In 1964, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) received intelligence briefings on various global hotspots. Also in 1964, a briefing for President Rivera in El Salvador was planned, highlighting the importance of managing leads and ensuring appropriate credit for the Intel Service Chief. The documents suggest that intelligence briefings were a standard practice for informing leaders about critical situations and developments, but the documents do not directly link intelligence briefings to the JFK assassination.",
