  "summary": "AMLASH refers to Rolando Cubela Secades, a Cuban doctor and former revolutionary who became a CIA asset. The AMLASH operation was a CIA effort aimed at organizing a military coup against Fidel Castro. Documents indicate that the CIA was actively involved in managing AMLASH, including facilitating contact with other agents, granting visas to his family, and relaying information through secure channels. The operation spanned from at least 1963 to the late 1960s, with continued monitoring of AMLASH and his family into the 1980s. Concerns about the security of the operation and potential exposure to Cuban intelligence are also evident. AMLASH was also connected to Operation Mongoose, which aimed to remove Castro from power.",

The Church Committee investigated the CIA's interrogation of Tepedino regarding AMLASH and his connections, suggesting a potential link, although the exact nature of his involvement remains unclear from these documents alone.",
