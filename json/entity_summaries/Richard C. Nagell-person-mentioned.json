  "summary": "Richard C. Nagell is mentioned in connection to the case of Victor L. Trinkala, an underage soldier who sought discharge from the U.S. Army. The documents suggest Nagell may have intervened to prevent Trinkala's deployment to Vietnam, possibly due to Trinkala's status as a conscientious objector. One agent report mentions an anonymous caller alleging Trinkala was contacted by a \"Soviet Agent.\" Trinkala himself stated he had limited contact with Nagell but believed Nagell helped him get discharged. An agent report details a local agency check regarding a Post Office Box registered to Nagell. Another report details an interview with Harfez Muneer regarding Nagell's connections to Trinkala's separation from military service.",
