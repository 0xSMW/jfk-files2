  "summary": "Yurily Ivanovich Nosenko was a KGB officer who defected to the United States in 1964. His defection and subsequent handling by the CIA were subjects of considerable scrutiny, investigation, and debate, including concerns about whether he was a genuine defector or a KGB plant. The CIA subjected him to interviews, polygraph tests, graphological analysis, psychological testing, and psychiatric evaluations to assess his bona fides. He was involuntarily confined by the CIA for approximately three years before being employed as a consultant and later becoming a U.S. citizen. Nosenko testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) regarding Lee Harvey Oswald's time in the Soviet Union and the KGB's alleged lack of interest in him. The documents also reveal scrutiny surrounding the veracity and completeness of Nosenko's information, particularly in relation to the JFK assassination, and mention potential interrogation regarding the Wallenberg case.",
