  "summary": "Evelio Duque Miyar, also known as Evelio Duque, is a Cuban citizen and anti-communist who arrived in Quito, Ecuador, in 1966. He is of interest due to his past interactions with the CIA, who initially provided assistance but later terminated the relationship. There are indications of his involvement in anti-Castro activities and potential connections to drug trafficking, including a meeting with Alfredo Ordonez Gonzalez in Central America. In 1978, he operated a confectionery store in Guayaquil, Ecuador, across from the U.S. consulate, leading to further scrutiny regarding possible Cuban operations in Miami during the early 1960s.",
