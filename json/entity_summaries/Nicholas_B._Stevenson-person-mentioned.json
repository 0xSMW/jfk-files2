  "summary": "Nicholas B. Stevenson was a Sergeant in the USAF whose interview became relevant to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigation into the JFK assassination. The HSCA interviewed Stevenson regarding allegations made by David F. Christensen, focusing on Stevenson's recollections of events at USA-55, Kirknewton, Scotland. His interview was reviewed by Julia Wetzel from the NSA, who recommended portions of the report be classified due to sensitive communications intelligence. The documents suggest Stevenson had information related to a facility able to collect the Lisbon-Tangier link, which was deemed sensitive enough to warrant classification.",
