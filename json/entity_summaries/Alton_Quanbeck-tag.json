  "summary": "Alton Quanbeck is mentioned in a series of documents related to the Senate Select Committee's inquiries to the NSA concerning the Warren Commission in 1976. While the documents detail the NSA's responses to the committee's queries regarding their involvement in the Warren Commission's investigation of the JFK assassination, the specific role or actions of Alton Quanbeck are not explicitly detailed. The documents primarily focus on the NSA's limited role, including reviewing exhibits for secret writing, providing information on Cuban military alerts after the assassination, and the overall lack of relevant findings related to the assassination. Therefore, without further context, it's difficult to ascertain Quanbeck's direct involvement or significance based solely on these documents.",
