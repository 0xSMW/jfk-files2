One document requests the station's assistance in contacting a former employee residing in Bangkok to inform them about the potential release of their name in JFK assassination-related documents. The other two documents do not mention the JFK assassination. One concerns Patrick PO HLA and his potential discussions with Melbourne Station, and the other summarizes contact reports with MPTROIKA-7.",
