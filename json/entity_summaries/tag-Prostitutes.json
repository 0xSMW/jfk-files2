  "summary": "The documents mention \"Prostitutes\" primarily in the context of a CIA cable (157-10004-10280) reporting allegations that Robert Maheu violated the Mann Act by procuring prostitutes for a foreign leader during a state visit in 1956. The other two documents (104-10106-10312 and 104-10418-10202) are about Yurily Ivanovich Nosenko, a Soviet KGB officer who defected in 1964 and was confined by the CIA for approximately three years, but they do not mention prostitutes. The connection of prostitutes to the JFK assassination context is not explicitly stated in these documents, but the mention of Robert Maheu, who had connections to the CIA and Howard Hughes, suggests a potential link to broader intelligence activities during that era.",

  "significance": "The significance of prostitutes in the JFK context, based on these documents, is indirect. The mention of Robert Maheu's alleged activities involving prostitutes suggests a potential connection to broader intelligence operations and questionable activities during that period. However, the direct relevance to the JFK assassination is not explicitly detailed in these documents.",
