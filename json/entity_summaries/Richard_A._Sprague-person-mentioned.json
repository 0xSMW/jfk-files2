  "summary": "Richard A. Sprague is mentioned in the context of payroll records from the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). Document 180-10070-10160 specifically mentions his employment with the HSCA, detailing his payroll authorizations, salary adjustments, and a memorandum regarding payroll certifications. While the majority of the documents focus on payroll records of other HSCA staff and administrative processes like the Assassination Records Review Board's (ARRB) final determination notifications regarding the postponement of Social Security numbers for privacy reasons, Sprague's inclusion indicates he was an employee or contractor of the HSCA. The documents do not provide specific details about his role or responsibilities within the HSCA, only that he was compensated for his services.",
