  "summary": "Robert A. Maheu was a key figure in sensitive CIA operations from the early 1950s through the 1970s. With a background as an FBI agent, personnel relations executive, and private investigator, he was recruited by the CIA's Office of Security and became involved in various covert activities. These included attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro, providing services to King Hussein of Jordan, and involvement in projects like HARPSTAR, which aimed to influence foreign leaders. Maheu's activities, often ethically questionable, involved organized crime, wiretapping, and staging films. His work drew the attention of Senate Subcommittees and was investigated by INTERTEL on behalf of the Hughes Tool Company, and the FBI investigated telephone calls from his office.",
