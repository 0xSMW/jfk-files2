  "summary": "The Lisbon-Tangier link refers to a communications link or facility capable of collecting communications between Lisbon and Tangier. Its significance arises in the context of a report reviewed by Julia Wetzel from the NSA for the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The report, concerning an interview with Sgt. Nicholas B. Stevenson, USAF, mentioned this facility. Due to the sensitive nature of communications intelligence, portions of the report were recommended for classification as \"CONFIDENTIAL, HANDLE VIA COMINT CHANNELS ONLY,\" indicating the importance of maintaining secrecy around the capabilities and operations related to this link. The documents suggest the HSCA was interested in this link as part of their investigation.",
