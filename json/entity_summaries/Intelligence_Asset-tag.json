Another document details Manuel Machado Llosas, a Cuban exile and CIA agent in Mexico, who is used for intelligence and political action. A third document provides operational information about an intelligence asset with the cryptonym CREBORY/1, covering aspects such as recruitment, motivation, cover, and security. The documents highlight the CIA's active recruitment and utilization of individuals with specific backgrounds and connections for intelligence operations.",
