He is also indirectly referenced in notes relating to Book V of the Church Committee report, specifically regarding the CIA's interrogation of Tepedino concerning the AMLASH operation and Rolando Cubela's (AMLASH) connections, and the handling of AMLASH's name in the context of the JFK assassination investigation. While Angleton's direct involvement in the JFK assassination is not explicitly stated, the documents suggest his role in CIA operations and counterintelligence activities that are relevant to understanding the broader context of the assassination investigation.",
