  "summary": "Mao Tse-tung, a prominent figure in communist ideology, is mentioned in the context of combating communist subversion and activities, particularly in Latin America. The documents do not directly link Mao to the JFK assassination but rather portray him as a symbol of communist influence and revolutionary movements that the U.S. government, including the CIA, was actively working to counter during the Cold War era. His name appears in documents detailing efforts to curb Cuban subversion and Castro-Communist influence, indicating that his ideology and the movements inspired by it were seen as a threat to U.S. interests in the region. The documents span from 1961 to 1975, reflecting a sustained period of concern over communist expansion.",
