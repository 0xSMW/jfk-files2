  "summary": "The documents provided do not directly implicate William C. Sullivan in the JFK assassination. Instead, they focus on the FBI's response to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) requests for materials related to Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Sullivan's role, as suggested by the documents, appears to be related to internal FBI operations and responses to external inquiries from the Senate Select Committee. The documents indicate that the FBI was tasked with locating and providing specific materials requested by the SSC, and Sullivan's involvement likely pertains to the management or oversight of this process. One document mentions an interview conducted by the Senate Select Committee (SSC) with former Assistant Director Ivan Conrad, which may suggest Sullivan's involvement in FBI investigations.",
