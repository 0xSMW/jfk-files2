  "summary": "J. D. Lavery is identified as the recipient of several memoranda concerning the classification of a document labeled EX 3600. These memoranda, all dated April 7, 1977, originate from P. Haefner and J. Haffner, and are routed via A. Addona. The core subject revolves around justifying the classification of EX 3600, primarily due to its connection to Operation MHCHAOS and the inclusion of information derived from sensitive sources, classified FBI reports, and sensitive methods. The documents suggest a need for a FOIA exemption for EX 3600. Lavery's role appears to be in the Office of General Counsel (OGC), based on one of the memos.",
