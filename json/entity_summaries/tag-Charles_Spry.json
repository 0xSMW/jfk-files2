In these letters, Helms acknowledges Spry's recommendation against declassifying these documents and assures him that the CIA currently has no plans to release them, citing the absence of public pressure and Spry's reasoning for keeping them private. This suggests Spry held a position where his opinion on declassification matters was considered significant by the CIA.",
