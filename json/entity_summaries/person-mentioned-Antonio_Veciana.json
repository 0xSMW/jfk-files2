  "summary": "Antonio Veciana was a Cuban exile who is mentioned in several documents related to investigations into the JFK assassination. The documents reveal that both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) requested information about him from the NSA. A 1962 NSA report discusses plans for the execution of Antonio Veciana and Geronimo Estevez, referencing another plan called PO ALPHA. The SSCI specifically requested and reviewed an NSA product on Veciana, leading to a broader request for all Cuban material from 1961-1965. The documents suggest Veciana was of interest to intelligence agencies and committees investigating potential Cuban involvement in the JFK assassination.",
