  "summary": "California appears in the documents primarily as the location where local agency checks were conducted on individuals such as David Reed Fromer and Robert Scheer. These checks, performed by law enforcement agencies within California, aimed to uncover any existing records related to these individuals. Robert Scheer was also interviewed in Oakland, California. The documents suggest that California's law enforcement agencies were involved in routine background checks as part of investigations, though the specific purpose of these investigations in relation to the JFK assassination is not explicitly stated in these documents. One document mentions a payment to Edvard G. Tichborn, but it does not specify where the payment originated or where Tichborn was located, so its connection to California is tenuous.",
