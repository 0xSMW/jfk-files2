The documents do not explicitly state his profession or background, but his position on the Presidential Board suggests he was a prominent figure within the organization. There is no direct mention of his involvement or significance in the JFK assassination context within these documents. One document references FOIA requests, classification reviews, and related correspondence, but does not mention Goodlett.",
