  "summary": "Electronic surveillance, encompassing audio and telephone monitoring through wiretaps and other technical means, was a significant tool employed by the FBI and CIA, particularly during the Cold War era and the 1960s-70s. These activities, sometimes warrantless, targeted individuals and organizations suspected of espionage, communist activities, racketeering, or posing threats to national security. Targets included individuals like Martin Luther King Jr., Cuban exile leaders such as Manuel Artime, and groups like the Black Panther Party and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Surveillance operations extended to foreign locations, including Mexico City, and involved collaboration with foreign governments. The Senate Select Committee (SSC) investigated these activities, raising concerns about potential abuses and the scope of domestic surveillance.",
