  "summary": "The Department of Defense (DoD) is a U.S. government agency that plays a role in actions designed to counter Cuban subversion in Latin America during the early 1960s. The DoD collaborated with other agencies like the Department of State, the CIA, and the USIA in these efforts. Their activities included controlling travel to and from Cuba, monitoring and disrupting the clandestine movement of guerrillas and arms, controlling the transfer of funds, and strengthening counterinsurgency capabilities in Latin America. The DoD's involvement is documented in reports from the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban Affairs (ICCA) during 1963 and 1964. Additionally, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) corresponded with the Department of Defense regarding U.S. counterintelligence and security programs.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the Department of Defense's involvement in counter-subversion efforts against Cuba is significant because these activities reflect the broader political and security concerns of the U.S. government regarding Cuba and communism in the early 1960s. These efforts are part of the backdrop of tensions and covert operations that existed during this period, which are sometimes considered as potential motives or contributing factors in the assassination.",
