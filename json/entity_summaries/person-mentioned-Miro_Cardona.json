  "summary": "Dr. MIRO Cardona was a key figure involved in anti-Castro activities in 1961. The documents detail meetings with him where he discussed plans for anti-Castro propaganda, underground activities, and a potential commando raid in Cuba. He requested U.S. support, including arms, and proposed establishing a government on Cuban soil with U.S. military assistance. The meetings occurred around October 6, 1961, and were documented in memoranda dated October 10, 1961. A notable pattern across the documents is the consistent focus on Cardona's proposals for aggressive actions against the Castro regime and his reliance on U.S. support for these operations.",
