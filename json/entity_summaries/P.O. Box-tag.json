  "summary": "The documents reference P.O. boxes in two distinct contexts. One is a P.O. box in Coral Gables, Florida, associated with the identifier \"GRACE HOLMES.\" This P.O. box is mentioned in classified messages sent to multiple CIA stations. The other is P.O. Box 4433 at Brookland Station in Washington, D.C., established under the alias Diego S. Mardones for Officer Gilbert Richmond. The Coral Gables P.O. box appears in messages from December 1963, while the Washington D.C. P.O. box is documented in a 1972 memo. The pattern suggests the use of P.O. boxes for covert communications and operations by the CIA.",
