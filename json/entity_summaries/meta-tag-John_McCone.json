  "summary": "John McCone served as the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) during a critical period encompassing the lead-up to and aftermath of the JFK assassination. He was deeply involved in sensitive intelligence matters, including Operation MONGOOSE (covert operations against Cuba), surveillance operations in Mexico City, and the handling of Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko. McCone briefed President Johnson on these matters and interacted with figures like Bissell, Helms, and Harvey. His actions and knowledge were later scrutinized in the context of the JFK assassination inquiry, particularly regarding CIA activities that may have exceeded the Agency's charter. The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) reviewed intelligence related to Cuba during his tenure, placing McCone at the center of intelligence gathering and analysis concerning Cuba and the Soviet Union.",

The number of documents (15) further supports this assessment.",
