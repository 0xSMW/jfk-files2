These reviews can reveal the extent of knowledge about certain individuals, their activities, and their relationships, potentially shedding light on possible connections to the assassination or related events. The reviews conducted by the HSCA, for example, demonstrate the interest in specific individuals and their files as part of the broader investigation into the assassination.",
