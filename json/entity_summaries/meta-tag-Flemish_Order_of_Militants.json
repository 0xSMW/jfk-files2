  "summary": "The Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO), also known as the Flemish Order of Militants, is a Flemish militant organization that came to the attention of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1978 during its investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. The HSCA requested information regarding potential contacts between VMO members and American citizens between 1968 and 1970. However, intelligence sources, specifically NIGALE and the liaison contact NITRUST, were reluctant to share this information due to concerns about potential leaks, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and preserving intelligence relationships. Consequently, a report on the VMO for the House of Representatives Committee was not prepared due to a perceived lack of readily available information and the desire to protect intelligence sources and methods.",

  "significance": "Medium. The Flemish Order of Militants is mentioned in 8 documents in connection with the HSCA investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. The reluctance to share information about the VMO suggests a potential, though not definitively established, connection of interest to the investigation.",
