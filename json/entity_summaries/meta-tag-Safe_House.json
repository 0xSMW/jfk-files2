  "summary": "CIA safe houses were secure locations used for various clandestine activities during the Cold War era. These safe houses, such as apartments at Summit Hill Apartments in Silver Spring, Maryland, served as secure meeting places, temporary housing for assets like AMMUG-1 and Vladimir Rodriguez Lahera, and locations for sensitive operations including training and assessment of REDSKIN agent candidates. Security protocols were paramount, with efforts made to maintain discretion and avoid compromises. Safe houses also facilitated communications, as evidenced by a trace on a phone call originating from one such location. They were a standard component of CIA operations, providing secure environments for activities ranging from agent training to handling Soviet defectors.",
