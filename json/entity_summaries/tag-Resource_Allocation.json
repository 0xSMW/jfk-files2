  "summary": "Resource allocation, in the context of these documents, refers to the distribution of funds, personnel, and other assets to support intelligence activities and the declassification of JFK assassination records. The documents highlight concerns and discussions surrounding the adequacy and efficiency of resource allocation within the CIA and related government bodies. Specifically, the Senate Select Committee hearing transcript mentions resource allocation as part of the DCI's responsibilities in coordinating intelligence activities. The memos and letters related to the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) reveal concerns about meeting deadlines due to resource constraints and the CIA's commitment to providing adequate resources for declassification efforts while balancing the need to protect sensitive information. The documents also show the ARRB expressing concerns about the pace of declassification due to resource limitations, prompting internal CIA discussions about funding and resource allocation for the project.",
