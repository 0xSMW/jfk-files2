  "summary": "Portugal appears in the JFK assassination context primarily in relation to potential leads investigated by the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concerning James Earl Ray, the convicted assassin of Martin Luther King Jr. The HSCA investigated possible connections or leads Ray may have had in Portugal, the UK, and Mexico. Additionally, Portuguese intelligence monitored Fidel Castro's reaction to President Kennedy's assassination, reporting Castro's fear of U.S. retaliation and attempts to deflect blame. Furthermore, Portugal's lobbying efforts at the UN were impacted by the adjournment following Kennedy's death, providing them with more time to garner support for their initiatives.",
