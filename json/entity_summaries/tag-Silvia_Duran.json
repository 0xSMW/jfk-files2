  "summary": "Silvia Duran was an employee of the Cuban consulate in Mexico City in 1963. Her significance arises from her interactions with Lee Harvey Oswald when he visited the consulate seeking a visa to travel to Cuba, en route to the Soviet Union. Following the Kennedy assassination, Duran was interrogated regarding Oswald's visa application. A Cuban letter of protest to Mexico alleged that Duran was mistreated during this interrogation and implicated the CIA in a conspiracy related to the assassination, accusing Mexican police of complicity with those who planned Kennedy's assassination. The documents suggest that Duran's role in processing Oswald's visa application made her a person of interest in the investigation following the assassination.",
