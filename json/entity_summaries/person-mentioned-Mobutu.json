  "summary": "Mobutu Sese Seko was a Congolese politician and military officer who played a significant role in the Congo (later Zaire). The documents suggest that the CIA had a relationship with Mobutu, particularly in the context of political action and plans to oust Patrice Lumumba. One document specifically mentions the CIA's relationship with Mobutu. While the documents do not directly link Mobutu to the JFK assassination, they highlight his involvement in the political turmoil and covert operations in the Congo during the early 1960s, a period when the U.S. government was actively involved in various covert actions globally. The documents also suggest that Mobutu was a key figure in the Congo, and the CIA saw him as an important ally.",
