  "summary": "Public Disclosure, encompassing 'Document Release' and 'Public Release', is a significant tag within the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. It relates to the mandated review and release of documents pertaining to the JFK assassination, balancing transparency with national security and individual privacy. This process involved the CIA contacting former employees, including those stationed overseas (e.g., Paris, Bonn, Mexico City, Hong Kong, Vienna, Caracas, Costa Rica), to inform them of potential disclosures of their names and offer them the opportunity to request postponements, particularly concerning security risks related to their former cover. The process also involves internal discussions, coordination with agencies like the British SIS, and managing FOIA requests.",
