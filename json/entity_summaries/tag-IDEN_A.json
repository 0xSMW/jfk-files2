  "summary": "IDEN A appears to be a tag associated with individuals or operations of interest to the CIA. One document mentions IDEN A in connection with Jose Artecona's request for miniature cameras to be transmitted to PBRUMEN through a channel involving IDEN B and a \"diplomatic pouch.\" Another document identifies IDEN A as a wealthy New Orleans businessman used in JMWAVE cover operations, with a request for a 201 file number to be assigned to him. The other documents do not provide specific details about IDEN A's identity or activities but suggest involvement in recruitment efforts in Cuba and potential connections to sensitive information and surveillance operations.",
