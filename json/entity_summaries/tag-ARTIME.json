Another document lists cables removed during the Watergate file search, indicating ARTIME's connection to AMANCHOR-1/AMNAIL operations and Cuban exiles. The third document does not directly mention ARTIME but provides context about Cuban exile activities and individuals involved, which may indirectly relate to ARTIME's sphere of influence or operations.",

  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, ARTIME's significance in the JFK assassination context is not directly evident. However, the connections to Cuban exile groups and potential sabotage activities against Cuba suggest a possible indirect link. The removal of cables related to ARTIME during the Watergate file search might indicate a concern about the exposure of past operations or connections that could have been politically sensitive.",
