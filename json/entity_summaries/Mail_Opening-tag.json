Howard Osborn testified about CIA mail opening projects like SR POINTER and West Pointer, and cooperative arrangements with Customs. These operations sometimes involved opening mail without explicit authorization, and higher-ups were aware of the New York mail openings. The FBI was also concerned about the Senate Select Committee's inquiries into mail opening activities.",
