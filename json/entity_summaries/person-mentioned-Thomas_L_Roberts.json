  "significance": "Thomas L. Roberts's significance in the JFK context is primarily tied to his connection with Herbert Itkin and his role as a deep cover CIA agent. The documents suggest that Roberts was part of a network that the CIA was investigating, and his identity was relevant to verifying Itkin's claims of CIA involvement. However, the documents do not explicitly link Roberts to the JFK assassination itself, but rather to the broader context of CIA activities and investigations during that period.",
