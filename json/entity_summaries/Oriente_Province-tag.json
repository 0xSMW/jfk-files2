  "summary": "Oriente Province, Cuba, is mentioned in several documents related to intelligence activities. In late May 1960, a report suggested the possible construction of a rocket launching site in the province. Later, in November 1963, following President Kennedy's assassination, an alert was issued in Oriente Province, which was believed to have been terminated by November 25, 1963. Cuban Navy communications returned to normal at that time. The alert may have been prompted by President Kennedy's death. The documents suggest that Oriente Province was an area of interest for U.S. intelligence gathering, particularly concerning military activities and potential threats.",
