  "summary": "REDSOX appears to be a CIA operation or designation, possibly related to activities within the USSR or involving Soviet-related matters. The documents connect REDSOX to the WIROGUE project, specifically involving agents such as AEASPIC. The documents detail recruitment, assessment, and planned deployment of agents. One document mentions arrangements for AEASPIC's extended stay in the U.S. under an alias. The timeline spans from 1959 to 1964, with a focus on agent recruitment and operational planning. A notable pattern is the association of REDSOX with agent recruitment, accommodation, and operational logistics, particularly within the context of the WIROGUE project.",
