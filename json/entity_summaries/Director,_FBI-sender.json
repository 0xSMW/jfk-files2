The documents suggest the FBI was actively monitoring these groups and individuals, which could be relevant to understanding the broader context of the assassination and potential motives or actors involved. The FBI's interactions with other government bodies, such as the Senate Select Committee, also highlight the agency's accountability and oversight in intelligence matters.",
