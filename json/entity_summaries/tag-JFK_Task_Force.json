  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, the 'JFK Task Force' is not explicitly mentioned. However, the documents relate to investigations and records associated with the JFK assassination. The documents include payroll records from the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), a review of the ZRRIFLE file, and a memorandum about the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC). These documents suggest the context involves investigations into the assassination, potential connections to individuals and groups involved, and the historical backdrop of U.S.-Cuban relations during that period. The absence of direct mentions of the 'JFK Task Force' suggests that the documents are related to the broader investigation rather than a specific task force.",
