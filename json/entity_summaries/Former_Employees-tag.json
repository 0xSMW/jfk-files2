  "summary": "The documents refer to former employees of the FBI and CIA. In the context of the Senate Select Committee inquiries into COINTELPRO activities in 1975, the FBI was tasked with contacting former employees to alert them about potential interviews regarding their involvement in COINTELPRO. The CIA, in 1995, requested the Mexico City station to contact former employees who retired under cover and resided in Mexico, informing them that their names appeared in documents being reviewed for public release under the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. This indicates that former employees may possess information relevant to the JFK assassination, or their identities are mentioned in related documents.",
