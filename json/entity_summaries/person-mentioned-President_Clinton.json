  "summary": "President Clinton is mentioned in the context of the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) and the release of JFK assassination records. While not directly involved in the assassination itself, his administration oversaw the ARRB's efforts to declassify and release documents related to the event. The documents highlight the CIA's concerns about protecting sensitive information, human sources, and ongoing intelligence operations while complying with the JFK Act, which was signed into law during Clinton's presidency. The documents suggest that the ARRB, operating under Clinton's administration, played a crucial role in pushing for transparency and the release of information, leading to interactions and negotiations with agencies like the CIA.",
