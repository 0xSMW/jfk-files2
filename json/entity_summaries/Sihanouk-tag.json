One document mentions Sihanouk's anger towards the U.S. Government, indicating potential diplomatic tensions. Another document notes Cambodian gratitude towards Peking leaders, suggesting a relationship with China. While the documents do not directly link Sihanouk to the JFK assassination, they place him within the geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia during a period of intense Cold War activity and covert operations, some of which involved assassination plots in the region.",
