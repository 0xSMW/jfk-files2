  "summary": "The 'Green List' appears to be a designation or classification used in connection with individuals, potentially related to Cuban operations or intelligence activities. The documents suggest it was used alongside 201 numbers, possibly as a tracking or identification system. The documents mentioning the Green List are primarily lists of names with associated numbers, and a form requesting personal information as part of a Green List request. One document notes 'POA Cancelled' in relation to a list with Green List numbers, suggesting a potential operational context. The documents span from 1961 to 1968, indicating the use of the Green List designation during this period.",

  "significance": "The significance of the 'Green List' in the JFK assassination context is not explicitly stated in these documents. However, the association with Cuban operations and intelligence activities suggests a potential connection to individuals or groups involved in anti-Castro efforts, which have been theorized to be linked to the assassination. Further research would be needed to determine the specific role or relevance of the 'Green List' in the JFK assassination.",
