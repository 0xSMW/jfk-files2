  "summary": "The JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 is a United States law mandating the release of government records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The CIA documents reveal the agency's efforts to comply with the Act, primarily focusing on identifying and contacting former employees whose names appear in potentially releasable documents. The CIA sought to inform these individuals about the impending public disclosure and offer them the opportunity to request redaction or postponement of the release if they believed their safety or sensitive activities could be compromised. The documents span from 1966 to 1998, with a concentration in the mid-1990s as the Act came into effect. A notable pattern is the repeated requests from CIA headquarters to various stations worldwide for assistance in locating and contacting former employees, indicating a systematic effort to adhere to the Act's requirements. The documents also reveal concerns about protecting the privacy of individuals mentioned in the records, particularly regarding social security numbers.",
