  "summary": "Hugh C. McDonald is associated with World Associates, Inc. Documents detail CIA's assessment, security clearances, and potential utilization of McDonald's voice identification system and his planned world tour for intelligence gathering. One document explores potential connections between a Soviet scientist, Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, and an individual known as 'Saul' who claimed involvement in the Kennedy assassination. It also mentions the possibility that MOSKALEV might be the 'unidentified man' photographed entering and departing the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City in October 1963. Another document discusses an Identi-kit project and a magazine article that incorrectly stated the U.S. Intelligence underwrote the development, prompting an investigation into potential disclosure of classified information.",
