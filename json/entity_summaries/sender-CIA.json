  "significance": "In the JFK assassination context, the CIA's significance lies in its potential knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald's activities, particularly his visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City. The documents suggest the CIA was monitoring Oswald and gathering information about his contacts and movements. Additionally, the CIA's involvement in anti-Castro activities and its knowledge of Cuban reactions to Kennedy's assassination are relevant. The documents also indicate the CIA's awareness of potential threats to U.S. officials and facilities, which could be pertinent to understanding the security context surrounding the assassination.",
