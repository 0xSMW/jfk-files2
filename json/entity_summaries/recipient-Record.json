Several documents also pertain to the investigation into Lee Harvey Oswald's activities, particularly his time in the Soviet Union and Finland, and the CIA's interactions with the Warren Commission. The documents also touch on other foreign policy issues, such as Vietnam and Pakistan, and internal CIA matters, such as personnel issues and security concerns.",
