  "significance": "The significance of Andrew Young in the JFK context, based solely on these documents, is indirect. He is mentioned in relation to investigations of Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC, which were subjects of FBI scrutiny. The documents do not explicitly link him to the JFK assassination, but his association with King places him within the broader historical context of political surveillance and civil rights activism during that era.",
