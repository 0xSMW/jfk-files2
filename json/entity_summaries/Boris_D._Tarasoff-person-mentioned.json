  "summary": "Boris D. Tarasoff was a CIA employee, specifically with the FDD/00 division, as indicated by a travel briefing sheet from 1960. His official personnel file contains memos, personnel action requests, and notices related to his employment with the CIA, including his retirement, reassignments, and a request for early home leave due to his wife's parents' poor health. In 1960, he was authorized to travel to Mexico City for 90 days to replace a station employee on home leave. A memo from 1975 directs the removal of credit blocks for several individuals, including Tarasoff. His wife, Anna Tarasoff, is also mentioned in a memorandum detailing a meeting to discuss potential security risks associated with her father's planned visit to the Russian Embassy to obtain a visa. The CIA decided not to brief Anna's father on her CIA employment and provided her with an army cover.",
