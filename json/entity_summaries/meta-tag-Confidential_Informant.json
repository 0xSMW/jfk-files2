  "summary": "Confidential informants were a crucial component of intelligence gathering for the FBI and potentially the CIA, particularly from the late 1950s through the 1970s. They provided information on a wide range of activities, including organized crime figures like Santo Trafficante Jr., John Rosselli, and Carlos Marcello, anti-Castro activities and Cuban exile groups, and potential threats to national security. The FBI established procedures, such as \"Bureau Informant 100,\" to handle sensitive information received from informants, including that obtained through liaison arrangements with the Israeli Intelligence Service. Informants were also used in investigations related to the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy, as well as counterintelligence programs and efforts to disrupt hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan. Protecting the identity of these informants was a key concern.",
