  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, U-2 overflights are significant because they were a crucial element of the intelligence operations focused on Cuba, a region of intense interest and concern during the Kennedy administration. The overflights were part of a broader effort to monitor and respond to the Soviet military presence in Cuba, which was a major foreign policy challenge for President Kennedy. The intelligence gathered from these flights influenced policy decisions and contributed to the overall understanding of the situation in Cuba. The documents suggest that the U-2 overflights were a critical tool for gathering information and informing decision-making during a tense period of the Cold War.",
