  "summary": "Lee H. Wigren is a person mentioned in three documents related to the JFK assassination and associated investigations. One document primarily focuses on personnel actions related to Wigren within an organization, including reassignments, promotion, delegation of authority, and retirement planning information spanning from 1950 to 1978. The other two documents do not directly involve Wigren, but are related to Lee Harvey Oswald's stay in Helsinki and inconsistencies in information provided by the CIA and the Department of State regarding the Oswalds' departure from the USSR. The connection between Wigren and the JFK assassination context is not explicitly stated in the provided documents, but the mention of his name in files related to the investigation suggests a possible role within the CIA or a related organization.",
  "key_connections": [],
  "significance": "The significance of Lee H. Wigren in the JFK assassination context is unclear based solely on these documents. The personnel file suggests he was an employee of an organization involved in the investigation, but his direct involvement in the Oswald case is not specified. Further investigation would be needed to determine his specific role and significance.",
