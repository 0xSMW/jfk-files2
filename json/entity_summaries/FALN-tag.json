  "summary": "FALN (Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci√≥n Nacional) is mentioned in the context of Cuban support for subversive activities in Latin America. Specifically, Venezuela complained to the OAS about Cuban aid to FALN, leading to increased tensions in Havana. The documents suggest that Cuba was providing financial and logistical support to guerrilla groups, including FALN, through various means such as cash transfers, guerrilla training, and bank robberies. The documents highlight Cuba's involvement in supporting revolutionary movements in Latin America during the early 1960s.",

  "significance": "FALN's significance in the JFK assassination context is indirect. The documents suggest a broader context of Cuban support for subversive activities in Latin America, which contributed to tensions between the US and Cuba. One document mentions rising tensions between Cuba and Mexico due to the detention of a Mexican woman linked to Lee Oswald, suggesting a possible connection between Cuban activities and individuals associated with the assassination, although the nature of this connection is not explicitly stated.",
