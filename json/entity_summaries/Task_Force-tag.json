  "summary": "The documents mention \"Task Force\" in different contexts. One document refers to the establishment of task forces within the FBI and inter-agency groups to manage congressional reviews and inquiries into intelligence activities in 1975. Another document mentions a task force related to the declassification of JFK assassination records in 1975, focusing on proofing and verification processes. The third document references a \"Task Force on Vietnam\" in 1961, discussing opportunities to exploit new management within Vietnamese national police and security service, proposing increased assistance, training, and US personnel. Therefore, the term \"Task Force\" appears to be a general term used to describe groups assembled for specific purposes, ranging from managing intelligence oversight to handling document declassification and addressing international issues like the situation in Vietnam. The documents do not indicate a single, unified \"Task Force\" but rather several distinct task forces operating in different contexts and time periods.",
