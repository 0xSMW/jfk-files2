  "summary": "Richard M. Bissell was a high-ranking CIA official deeply involved in covert operations during the Cold War, particularly concerning Cuba and potential assassinations of foreign leaders. He played a central role in the planning and execution of the Bay of Pigs invasion, a failed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro, and was also connected to Operation Mongoose. Bissell's involvement extended to discussions and planning related to potential assassinations of Fidel Castro, Patrice Lumumba, and Rafael Trujillo. His activities were scrutinized by the ARRB and the SSCIA, as evidenced by his 1975 testimony and the CIA's efforts to protect related records. The documents highlight his long-term involvement in sensitive CIA operations from the early 1960s to the late 1990s.",
