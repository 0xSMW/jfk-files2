  "summary": "Frank Fiorini was an arms buyer in Miami in 1959, investigated for possible Registration Act violations. A classified message from the Director to Santiago de Cuba instructs the base to deal with Fiorini under consular cover without making commitments that might be construed as approval of his activities. The documents also mention Manuel ARTINE Buesa, AMCARBON-1 (a media contact at the Miami Herald), and Alfred J. Sarno, who was involved in the CIA's AMUTS program, which involved Cuban exiles collecting intelligence on Cuba. The Latin America Division (LAD) report summarizes a task force investigation into possible Cuban complicity in the John F. Kennedy assassination, reviewing Agency operations against Cuba from 1960 to 1965 and finding no definitive proof of Cuban involvement.",
