  "summary": "The Western Hemisphere Division (also known as WH Division) of the CIA was actively involved in intelligence gathering and covert operations primarily in Latin America and Cuba from 1946 to the mid-1970s. Its activities included exploiting Khrushchev's visit to Cuba, gathering information on individuals connected to Cuba, and maintaining connections with foreign leaders like President Lopez Mateos of Mexico. The division also engaged in counterintelligence activities, such as telephone tapping in Mexico City targeting Soviet, Satellite, and Cuban agents, managing assets, and addressing security breaches, including those related to defectors. Projects like LIFEAT also fell under its purview, indicating a broad range of offensive and defensive operations.",
