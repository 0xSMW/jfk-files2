  "summary": "Joseph Raymond Merola is identified as a suspect in an armed robbery in a 1961 FBI teletype. He claimed to be connected with the CIA and involved in supplying arms to anti-Castro groups. The CIA denied any operational interest in Merola, although his boat was linked to anti-Castro operations. While the other documents do not directly relate to Merola, they are included in the set, but focus on Franc Pecar, a Yugoslav trade official, and his potential defection to the U.S., along with related communications between the CIA and FBI regarding Pecar's travel plans and potential recruitment.",
