Roberts is specifically mentioned in the context of Herbert Itkin's allegations of CIA involvement. He is identified as a \"negro lawyer\" and a deep cover agent for the Agency in Dakar. The documents suggest the CIA was interested in Itkin's claims and sought to verify them, including Roberts's connection. The timeline of involvement is primarily in the late 1960s, specifically 1968 and 1969, with a review of the Itkin file occurring later in 1977.",

  "significance": "Thomas L. Roberts's significance in the JFK context stems from his connection to Herbert Itkin and his alleged role as a deep cover CIA agent. The documents suggest that Roberts was part of a network that the CIA was investigating in relation to Itkin's claims. His identification as a CIA agent in Dakar, if verified, could potentially link the CIA to activities or individuals relevant to the JFK assassination, depending on the nature of Itkin's claims and the scope of Roberts's operations.",
