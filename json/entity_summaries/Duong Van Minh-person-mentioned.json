  "significance": "Duong Van Minh's significance in the JFK assassination context lies in his role in the coup that led to the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem in November 1963. The US government's involvement in or knowledge of this coup has been a subject of scrutiny and speculation, and Minh's leadership in the coup places him at the center of events that had significant implications for US-Vietnam relations and the broader Cold War context. The documents suggest that the CIA was aware of the coup plotting and that Minh was a key player in these events.",
