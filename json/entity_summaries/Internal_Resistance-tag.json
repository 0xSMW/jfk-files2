  "summary": "The concept of \"Internal Resistance\" in the provided documents primarily refers to efforts within Cuba to oppose and potentially overthrow the Castro regime without direct U.S. military intervention. Manolo Ray, an exile leader of the People's Revolutionary Movement (MRP), is a key figure advocating for this approach, emphasizing the importance of a broad-based internal movement supported by funds and trained exiles, rather than a U.S. invasion. The documents suggest that internal resistance was considered a viable alternative or complement to external actions against Cuba, with some exile groups focusing on building support within the island. The Cuba Project progress report also mentions monitoring internal conditions, suggesting an interest in understanding and potentially influencing internal resistance movements. However, the documents do not directly link internal resistance to the JFK assassination.",

The documents primarily discuss it as an alternative strategy to overthrow Castro, favored by some exile groups and leaders like Manolo Ray. There is no direct evidence within these documents to suggest a connection between internal resistance efforts and the assassination of JFK.",
