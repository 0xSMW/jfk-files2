  "summary": "The documents reveal extensive diplomatic activity following President Kennedy's assassination, primarily focusing on international reactions, security concerns, and potential shifts in foreign policy. Numerous countries, including Mexico, Cuba, Poland, and others, expressed condolences and observed mourning periods. Diplomatic channels were used to relay information, assess potential policy changes, and address concerns about the assassination's impact on international relations. Several reports detail the reactions of foreign governments and their intelligence agencies, including concerns about potential U.S. retaliation against Cuba, shifts in Mexican-Cuban relations, and the spread of conspiracy theories implicating various groups. Diplomatic missions were instructed to convey messages of sympathy and monitor the situation, while ambassadors reported on the reactions of foreign leaders and populations. The documents also highlight diplomatic efforts to secure the release of an American citizen from Cuba and address concerns about Cambodian broadcasts that appeared to celebrate Kennedy's death. The Warren Commission's findings were summarized for foreign ministries, and discussions about the commission's impartiality took place within diplomatic circles.",
