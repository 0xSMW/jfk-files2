  "summary": "The CIA's Miami Station was established in 1961 and played a significant role in anti-Castro activities, supporting Cuban exiles, and coordinating with various US government agencies. The station's activities included intelligence collection in the Caribbean and involvement in the AMUTS program, which utilized Cuban exiles for intelligence gathering on Cuba and debriefing refugees. The Miami Station recruited individuals like AMRUGB-5 as radio operators and infiltrators within anti-Castro groups. The station's activities were scrutinized by the Rockefeller Commission, as evidenced by the depositions of individuals like William C. Sturbitts, who provided testimony regarding the station's involvement in Cuban operations, discussions of possible assassination attempts against Fidel Castro, and relationships with individuals like Frank Sturgis. By the mid-1970s, the station was downsized and focused primarily on intelligence collection in the Caribbean.",
