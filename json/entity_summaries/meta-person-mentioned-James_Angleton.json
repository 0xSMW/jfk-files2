  "summary": "James Jesus Angleton was a high-ranking CIA official, most notably the chief of counterintelligence, and a key figure in CIA activities from the early 1950s through the 1970s. He is documented as a liaison between the CIA and the FBI, identified as \"Bureau Informant 100\" concerning sensitive intelligence matters, particularly regarding Israeli intelligence. Angleton's involvement extended to sensitive operations such as mail interception (Project HUNTER), investigations into leaks, and internal security matters, including the Special Investigations Group (CI/SIG). His role and actions were scrutinized by the Rockefeller Commission, the Senate Select Committee, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in relation to CIA counterintelligence methodologies, Soviet defectors, and potential CIA involvement in assassinations, making him a significant figure in investigations related to the JFK assassination.",
