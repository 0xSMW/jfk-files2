  "summary": "The British Security Service (BSS) is mentioned in the context of documents related to the JFK assassination. One document indicates that a memo containing British documents and a CIA document pertaining to the assassination was passed to SISON. Two other documents discuss the proposed declassification and release of a BSS document to the JFK Assassination Review Board concerning a 1963 interview with Mrs. Lillian Sloboda, wife of a defector to the USSR. The BSS strongly objected to the release of this document due to the confidential and personal nature of the information. The documents suggest the BSS possessed information relevant to the JFK assassination investigation, specifically an interview with someone connected to a defector to the USSR, and that there were concerns about releasing this information publicly.",

The reluctance of the BSS to declassify and release this document to the JFK Assassination Review Board suggests the information was considered sensitive or potentially damaging.",
