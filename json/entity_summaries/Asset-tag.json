These assets are used for a range of purposes, including gathering information, providing support for operations, and offering access to specific individuals or regimes. The documents span from the early 1960s to the late 1970s, with a concentration in the early to mid-1960s. The geographical locations mentioned include Mexico City, Miami, New Orleans, Rome, and Haiti, indicating a global network of assets. The recruitment and management of these assets involved coordination between different CIA departments and, in some cases, other government agencies like the Army and State Department. Some assets, like Luis Posada Carriles, have a complex history and alleged prior involvement with the agency.
