  "summary": "The documents reference paramilitary operations in the context of CIA activities. JMWAVE, a CIA component, had an Operations branch and a Covert Action branch, suggesting involvement in paramilitary activities. The documents also mention CIA operations in the Congo, including political action and plans to oust Lumumba, which could involve paramilitary elements. The procurement of Soviet ammunition, as discussed in the context of I. Irving Davidson, could potentially be linked to supplying paramilitary operations. The documents highlight the CIA's involvement in covert actions and political interference in foreign countries, which may have involved paramilitary operations.",
