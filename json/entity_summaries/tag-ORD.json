  "significance": "Without further context, the significance of the \"ORD\" tag in the JFK assassination context is unclear. The documents provided do not directly mention the JFK assassination. The tag appears to be a general classification for intelligence-related activities and individuals, and its relevance to the JFK assassination would depend on whether these individuals or organizations were connected to the events surrounding the assassination through other evidence.",
