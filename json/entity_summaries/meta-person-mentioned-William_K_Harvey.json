  "summary": "William K. Harvey was a CIA officer heavily involved in covert operations, particularly against Cuba during the early 1960s. He played a significant role in Operation Mongoose and was associated with discussions and planning related to potential assassination attempts on Fidel Castro. He was involved in Operation ZRRIFLE, focused on assassination capabilities, and had connections to individuals within and potentially outside the CIA, including Robert Maheu. Harvey served as Chief of Station (COS) in Rome and had contact with Clare Booth Luce. His activities were scrutinized by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSCIA, Church Committee) and the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), leading to testimonies and investigations. He was also involved in planning CIA operations against Cuba, focusing on intelligence gathering and isolating the Castro regime. Harvey's name also surfaces in connection to the Lumumba assassination plan in the Congo during 1960-1961.",
