  "summary": "Korea is mentioned in the documents in the context of a PFC born in Korea (Kenneth C. Griggs), and as a location for covert operations. One document references a letter concerning Kenneth C. Griggs, a PFC born in Korea. Another document mentions covert operations in Korea as part of a Special Group meeting discussing various international issues. While these documents mention Korea, they do not directly link it to the JFK assassination. The references are more incidental, indicating Korea's presence as a location of interest for military personnel and covert operations during the time period.",
