  "summary": "El Salvador appears in the documents primarily in the context of Cold War activities, particularly related to Cuban subversion and intelligence operations. The documents reveal that El Salvador was a location for CIA activities, including briefings for government officials on Cuban subversion, recruitment of Cuban defectors, and intelligence gathering. There are also references to the Communist Party of El Salvador and their requests for support from Cuba. The documents span from the early 1960s, with a notable concentration around 1963-1965. A pattern emerges of El Salvador being a focal point for U.S. intelligence operations aimed at countering Cuban influence in the region. Additionally, the country expressed condolences to the U.S. government following President Kennedy's assassination and decreed a three-day mourning period.",
