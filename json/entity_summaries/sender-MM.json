  "significance": "The FBI's Miami Field Office (MM) was involved in investigating individuals and groups with potential connections to anti-Castro activities, the CIA, and criminal activities in Miami during the period relevant to the JFK assassination. Its investigations touched on individuals who were allegedly involved in supplying arms to anti-Castro groups and individuals connected to bombings and other criminal activities. While the documents do not directly link MM to the JFK assassination, the office's focus on anti-Castro elements and CIA-related activities places it within the broader context of the political climate and potential actors involved during that era.",
