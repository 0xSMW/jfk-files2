  "summary": "The tag \"TOP_SECRET_UMBRA\" is a classification marking primarily used by the National Security Agency (NSA) on intelligence reports related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. These documents, spanning from November 1963 into the 1970s, detail global reactions to the assassination, potential conspiracies, and security measures implemented by various countries. A significant focus is placed on monitoring Cuban reactions and diplomatic communications, assessing potential threats, and analyzing the political implications of Kennedy's death on international relations. The documents also include inquiries and investigations conducted by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI).",
