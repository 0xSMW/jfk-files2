  "significance": "While the documents primarily focus on the CIA's potential involvement in the Watergate scandal, some documents are related to the Kennedy assassination. One document is an inventory of Rockefeller Commission files, which includes documents related to the Kennedy assassination. The connection between Watergate and the JFK assassination is not explicitly detailed in these documents, but the presence of JFK assassination-related files within the context of Watergate investigations suggests a potential area of interest or overlap.",
