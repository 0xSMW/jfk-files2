  "significance": "Court Wood's significance in the JFK assassination context lies in his connection to the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE and his pro-Castro sentiments during a period of heightened tensions between the United States and Cuba. The CIA was actively monitoring individuals and organizations associated with Cuba, and Wood's activities were of interest to the agency. The documents suggest that Wood was being monitored for his potential involvement in activities that could be seen as subversive or detrimental to U.S. interests.",
