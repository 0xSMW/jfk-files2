One involves a P.O. box in Coral Gables, Florida, associated with the identifier \"GRACE HOLMES,\" mentioned in classified messages sent to multiple CIA stations in December 1963. The other concerns the establishment of P.O. Box 4433 at Brookland Station in Washington, D.C., in April 1972, under the alias Diego S. Mardones for Officer Gilbert Richmond. The Coral Gables P.O. box appears in the context of potentially sensitive or clandestine communications, while the Washington D.C. P.O. box is related to internal CIA security measures.",
