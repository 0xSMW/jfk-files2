  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination documents, travel briefings highlight the movement of personnel and the security protocols in place during the period. While the documents provided do not directly link travel briefings to the assassination, they offer insight into the operational procedures and security concerns of the time, potentially relevant for understanding the context in which events related to the assassination unfolded. The presence of travel briefings to Mexico City, a location of interest in some JFK assassination theories, may be of particular interest.",
