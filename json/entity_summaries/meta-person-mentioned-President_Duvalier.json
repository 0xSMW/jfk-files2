  "summary": "President Francois Duvalier's administration in Haiti during the 1960s and 1970s is a focus of these documents, which reveal concerns about maintaining power, managing relations with the United States, and suppressing political opposition. Duvalier sought to improve Haiti's international image and attract foreign investment, while also perceiving threats from U.S. Embassy officials and Cuban exiles. The documents suggest the U.S. government monitored Haiti's political climate under Duvalier, including communications involving Haitian government representatives and Cuban intelligence activities. There are also indirect connections to the JFK assassination through Jean K. Saurel, a Haitian official allegedly connected to the Ton Ton Macoutes, who had associations with individuals linked to Lee Harvey Oswald.",
