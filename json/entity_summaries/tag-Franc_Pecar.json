The CIA believed Pecar might want to defect to the U.S. and requested information from the FBI. The FBI, however, advised against approaching Pecar, citing concerns from New York informants and a recent denial of clearance in a similar case. Pecar's travel plans included meetings in Miami, including one with Assistant Attorney General William Kenny, and a possible recruitment attempt during a visit to Vienna was mentioned.",
