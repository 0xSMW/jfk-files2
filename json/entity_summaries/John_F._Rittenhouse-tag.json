  "summary": "John F. Rittenhouse was associated with the CIA's Overseas Branch (OPC). In late 1950, there were plans to change his status from OPC Staff Employee to OPC Staff Agent and assign him to Mexico City as a GS-13 Intelligence Officer under State Department deep cover. However, his security clearance was later canceled, and he was reclassified as a semi-covert employee integrated into a department. The documents suggest a shift in Rittenhouse's role and status within the CIA during this period.",
