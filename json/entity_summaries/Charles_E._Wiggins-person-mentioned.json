  "summary": "Charles E. Wiggins is mentioned in documents related to the FBI's responses to Congressional committee requests, particularly those from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC). The documents concern investigations, COINTELPRO, security clearances for Senate Select Committee staff, and an incident involving an FBI informant. While the documents indicate that Wiggins is somehow related to these congressional inquiries, the specific nature of his involvement is not detailed. The documents do not provide enough information to determine his role or significance in the JFK assassination context.",
