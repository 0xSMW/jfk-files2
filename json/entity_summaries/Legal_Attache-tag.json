  "summary": "The Legal Attache is mentioned in three documents. One document involves disseminating information about a suspect in the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination. Another document involves transmitting a memo regarding Martin Luther King Jr.'s activities and the CIA's interest in his potential visit to Norway, with instructions not to inform Norwegian authorities of the CIA's interest. The third document is a Domestic Intelligence Division inspection report detailing division operations, accomplishments, surveys, projects, and administrative matters. The role of the Legal Attache appears to be related to receiving and transmitting information, potentially involving legal or intelligence matters across international locations. The documents do not directly connect the Legal Attache to the JFK assassination.",
