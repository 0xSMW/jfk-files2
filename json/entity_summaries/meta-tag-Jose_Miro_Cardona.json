  "summary": "Jose Miro Cardona was a central figure in the Cuban exile community and a key player in anti-Castro activities during the early 1960s. He was deeply involved in formulating and advocating for aggressive actions against the Castro regime, including anti-Castro propaganda, underground activities within Cuba, and a potential commando raid. Cardona actively sought U.S. support, requesting arms and proposing the establishment of a government on Cuban soil, potentially with U.S. military assistance. His role within the Cuban Revolutionary Council and his communications with figures like Miguel Ydigoras-Fuentes highlight his importance in coordinating efforts to undermine the Castro government.",
