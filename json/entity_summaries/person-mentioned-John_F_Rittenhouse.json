  "summary": "John F. Rittenhouse was an individual associated with the CIA's Overseas Branch (OPC). In late 1950, there were plans to change his status from an OPC Staff Employee to an OPC Staff Agent and assign him to Mexico City as a GS-13 Intelligence Officer under State Department deep cover. Security concurrence was sought and granted for this assignment. However, his security clearance was later canceled, and he was reclassified as a semi-covert employee integrated into a department. He is also mentioned in a document related to security deletions and revisions in E. Howard Hunt's manuscript, 'Undercover: Memoirs of an American Agent.'",
