  "summary": "The 'New Left' is referenced across several FBI documents, primarily in the context of domestic surveillance and counterintelligence operations. These documents do not explicitly define the New Left, but the context suggests it encompasses various leftist activist groups and movements active during the 1960s and 1970s. The FBI monitored these groups due to concerns about their alleged extremist activities and potential threats to national security. Specific organizations mentioned alongside the New Left include the Black Panther Party, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and the Young Lords. The documents reveal the FBI's efforts to gather intelligence on these groups through telephone surveillances and other means, as well as the coordination and conflicts between the FBI and CIA regarding domestic intelligence operations. The documents highlight the FBI's focus on domestic dissident groups during this period.",

The significance lies in understanding the broader political and social climate of the time, where domestic dissent and activism were met with government scrutiny and surveillance.",
