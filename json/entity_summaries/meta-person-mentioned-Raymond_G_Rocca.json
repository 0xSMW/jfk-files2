  "summary": "Raymond G. Rocca was a figure of interest in investigations and inquiries into CIA activities, particularly those related to the JFK assassination. His name appears in connection with requests from the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) for information on individuals and entities of interest. Rocca is identified as someone for whom the Central Cover Staff (CCS) held files. He is also mentioned in a transcript of a SSCIA hearing featuring testimony from DCI William Colby and in an inventory of Rockefeller Commission files. Documents summarize meetings with the Warren Commission discussing the CIA's involvement and information related to Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby. These references suggest Rocca held a position within the CIA that made him relevant to inquiries regarding the agency's potential involvement in the JFK assassination.",
