  "summary": "The World Peace Council (WPC) is an organization that appears in several documents. One document mentions a disruption at a WPC meeting by a Chinese delegate who denounced President Kennedy after expressions of sorrow for his death. Other documents detail U.S. participants at a WPC meeting in Budapest in 1971, including speeches on the Vietnam War, a posthumous award to Martin Luther King Jr., and the reelection of Herbert Aptheker and Carlton Goodlett to the Presidential Board. The documents suggest the WPC served as a venue for international discussions and expressions of political views, including those related to the Vietnam War and figures like Martin Luther King Jr.",
