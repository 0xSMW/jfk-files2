  "summary": "The documents mention \"Task Force\" in different contexts. One document refers to inter-agency groups establishing task forces to handle the workload related to congressional reviews and inquiries into intelligence activities in 1975. Another document mentions tasks related to the declassification of JFK assassination records, implying a task force or team was involved in this process in 1975. A third document from 1961 refers to a \"Task Force on Vietnam\" and discusses opportunities to exploit new management within Vietnamese national police and security service, proposing increased assistance, training, and US personnel for liaison and project management. The term \"Task Force\" appears to be a general term for a group assigned to a specific project or task, rather than a single, specific entity.",
