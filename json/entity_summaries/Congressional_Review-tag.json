The documents highlight efforts within the FBI, CIA, and NSA to manage information disclosure, coordinate responses to congressional inquiries, and establish mechanisms for handling the workload associated with these reviews. Key areas of interest for the congressional committees included assassinations, the Phoenix program, covert actions, and the Warren Commission's findings.",
