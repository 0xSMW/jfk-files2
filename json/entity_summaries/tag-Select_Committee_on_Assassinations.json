  "summary": "The Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) was a U.S. House of Representatives committee established to investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The documents primarily consist of payroll records and related notifications concerning the committee's staff from 1977 to 1979. These records detail employee names, positions, salaries, and social security numbers (though the latter were often redacted later for privacy). The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) played a role in reviewing and sometimes postponing the release of certain information from these records, particularly social security numbers. The documents provide a glimpse into the administrative and financial operations of the HSCA during its investigation.",

  "significance": "The Select Committee on Assassinations was significant for its formal investigation into the JFK assassination. While the documents provided focus on the administrative aspects of the committee, they indirectly highlight the committee's role in gathering information and employing staff to re-examine the circumstances surrounding President Kennedy's death. The payroll records and ARRB notifications offer a glimpse into the committee's operations and the subsequent efforts to manage and release related records.",
