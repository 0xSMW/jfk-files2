The documents suggest ZRRIFLE was active around 1962 and was still being investigated in the 1970s by the SSCIA. The project involved the transfer and use of assets like QJWIN, spotting potential candidates in Italy, and administrative and financial aspects related to individuals involved. One document mentions Jose Marie Mankel as a ZRRIFLE agent with a history involving illegal narcotics operations. The documents also indicate that ZRRIFLE was a subject of interest in the context of potential assassination plots and covert operations, leading to inquiries and reviews by committees like the SSCIA and the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB).",
