In one instance, it is mentioned in connection with Jose Artecona's request for miniature cameras to be transmitted to PBRUMEN through a channel involving IDEN A and IDEN B. This same \"diplomatic pouch\" is alleged to have been used to transmit small arms. The other two documents do not provide much information about the diplomatic pouch.",

This suggests its involvement in clandestine operations, though the specific context within the JFK assassination framework is not explicitly detailed in these documents.",
