  "summary": "The documents reference \"Legal Attaches\" primarily in the context of FBI activities and interactions with other agencies, particularly the CIA and the Department of State. The documents suggest that the Senate Select Committee (SSC) was interested in the contacts between the FBI, the President, and the Department of State regarding legal attaches in 1971. One memo discusses inquiries about the FBI's legal attaches and a request from the CIA to enter the Chilean Embassy. The documents also touch upon the broader relationship between the FBI and CIA, including instances of conflict and cooperation, and the sharing of information and technical developments. Sam Papich is a key figure mentioned in relation to these discussions.",
