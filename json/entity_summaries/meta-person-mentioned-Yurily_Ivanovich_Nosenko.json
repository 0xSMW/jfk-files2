  "summary": "Yurily Ivanovich Nosenko was a Soviet KGB officer who defected to the United States in 1964. Following his defection, the CIA subjected him to intense scrutiny, including involuntary confinement for approximately three years, to assess his bona fides and determine if he was a genuine defector or a KGB plant. His defection and subsequent interviews covered topics such as American tourists in Moscow, potential KGB recruitments, and Soviet intelligence operations. The FBI also questioned his credibility, and his case was code-named \"NORMAN.\" Nosenko later testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) regarding Lee Harvey Oswald's time in the Soviet Union. After his confinement, he was employed by the CIA as a consultant and later became a U.S. citizen, continuing to work under contract for the Agency. The handling of his case was a sensitive matter, discussed at high levels, including a briefing to President Johnson.",
