  "summary": "Juanita Reyes is identified as a character reference for Manuel Marti. Several attempts were made to contact her to verify information about Marti. Initial efforts to locate her at a provided address were unsuccessful, with reports indicating she no longer resided there and had possibly returned to Puerto Rico. A physical check at an address in the Bronx also yielded negative results. Eventually, contact was made, and Reyes stated that she did not know Manuel Marti. The documents suggest a focused effort to verify Marti's background through his listed references, with Reyes being one such individual.",
