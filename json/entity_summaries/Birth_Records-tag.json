  "summary": "The documents highlight the use of birth records in verifying identities and uncovering potential discrepancies, particularly in relation to individuals of interest. These records serve as a foundational element in establishing a person's background and can reveal instances of name changes or inconsistencies that may warrant further investigation. In the context of these documents, birth records are used to investigate Manuel Marti's background, revealing a name change and discrepancies in his father's identity. Similarly, birth records were checked in Italy for information related to John Rosselli, but no records were found under the names provided.
