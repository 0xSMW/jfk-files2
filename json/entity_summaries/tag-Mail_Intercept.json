  "summary": "Mail intercept, as described in the documents, refers to CIA activities involving the review, surveillance, and potential interception of mail. Project HUNTER is mentioned as a CIA program that reviewed mail to and from the Soviet Union, with the FBI collaborating to use this information for internal security. Other activities include sensitive security operations involving surveillance of journalists and mail intercepts, propaganda mailings, test mailings, and covert operations involving forged letters. The Justice Department also requested information related to these mail operations. These activities suggest a broad scope of mail-related intelligence gathering and covert actions conducted by the CIA.",
