  "summary": "NITRUST appears to be a liaison contact, possibly within an intelligence agency, based in Brussels. In May 1978, NITRUST was involved in a request related to the 'Flemish Order of Militants' (Vlaamse Militanten Orde - VMO). NITRUST was reluctant to share information on the VMO, specifically regarding potential contacts between VMO members and American citizens between 1968 and 1970, with the House Committee on Assassinations. This reluctance stemmed from concerns about potential information leaks and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The documents suggest NITRUST was a point of contact for information related to the VMO and its potential connections to American citizens, but was hesitant to disclose this information.",

  "significance": "NITRUST's significance in the JFK assassination context lies in their potential access to information regarding the Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO) and its possible connections to American citizens during the period leading up to and following the assassination. Their reluctance to share this information with the House Committee on Assassinations raises questions about what they knew and why they were unwilling to disclose it, potentially hindering investigations into possible foreign connections to the assassination.",
