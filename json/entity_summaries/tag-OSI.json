Another document mentions OS Indices being used as part of a request for investigation and name check. The third document does not directly mention OSI, but references an investigation being conducted by the DFO (Los Angeles Field Office).

  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, OSI's significance in the JFK assassination context is not explicitly stated. However, its role in CIA personnel assignments, intelligence activities, and investigations during the 1960s suggests a potential connection to broader intelligence operations that may be relevant to the JFK assassination. Further research would be needed to determine the extent of OSI's involvement, if any, in events related to the assassination.",
