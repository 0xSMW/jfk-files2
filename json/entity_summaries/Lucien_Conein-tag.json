The memo indicates Conein was stationed in Saigon at the time, and the CIA requested this information be withheld from the French. Further documents mention Conein in connection to Mitchell Livingston WerBell, III, and include files containing his employment history, performance reviews, and concerns about compromised cover within the CIA. Correspondence with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) is also noted, regarding Conein's employment verification. The documents suggest Conein's activities and connections were of interest to multiple agencies, including the FBI, CIA, and DEA.",
