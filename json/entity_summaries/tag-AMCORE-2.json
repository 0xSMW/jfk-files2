  "summary": "AMCORE-2 appears to be an asset or individual used by the CIA, possibly as a cutout or intermediary. In one instance, AMCORE-2 and a KUBARK proprietary were used as a front to procure a DC-3 aircraft charter for stranded newsmen. Another document discusses the possibility of bypassing AMCORE-2 to establish direct contact with AMCORE-2's source, suggesting AMCORE-2 acts as a handler or intermediary. AMCORE-2 also provided a sketch of battalion defensive positions obtained from Agent 1995, indicating involvement in intelligence gathering.",
