Specifically, it appears in the minutes of a June 1963 meeting where updates on OXCART were provided. It is also referenced in the agenda for a December 1962 meeting focusing on intelligence related to Cuba and advanced intelligence collection capabilities. The third document, a memorandum from March 1962, outlines recommendations from a working group regarding the organization and activities of the CIA, covering topics such as the Deputy Directorates, personnel assignments, public relations, and relationships with other agencies. The documents suggest OXCART was a significant intelligence project or capability under review by high-level advisory boards.",
