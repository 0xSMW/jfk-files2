  "summary": "The Department of Defense (DoD) appears in the documents in two primary contexts: its involvement in anti-Cuban activities during the early to mid-1960s and its role in conducting background checks and security clearances. Regarding Cuba, the DoD's efforts included controlling travel, disrupting guerrilla movements, and strengthening counterinsurgency capabilities, as documented by the ICCA. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence also examined the DoD's counterintelligence programs. In terms of security, the DoD conducted National Agency Checks and personnel security investigations to assess potential security risks, gathering information from sources like the FBI. The DoD also provided information to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) regarding Lee Harvey Oswald and responded to various inquiries. The DoD also provided official cover for employees and was involved in projects such as WUBETON.",
