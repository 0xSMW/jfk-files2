These activities span from 1946 to 1972, with a focus on the period between 1946 and 1965. The division's activities included exploiting Khrushchev's visit to Cuba in 1960 by instigating a church rally and spreading rumors of an assassination attempt. The division also gathered information on relatives of individuals of interest, such as Dario Guitart Manday. A historical staff study details the division's activities in Latin America and Cuba during the Cold War. The division also maintained relationships with foreign leaders, such as President Lopez Mateos of Mexico, discussing topics related to Cuba and U.S. relations.",
