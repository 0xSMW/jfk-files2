  "significance": "William C. Sturbitts is significant in the JFK assassination context due to his involvement in CIA's Cuban operations and his knowledge of potential assassination attempts against Fidel Castro. His depositions were part of investigations into possible Cuban complicity in the JFK assassination, although the Latin America Division report found no definitive proof of Cuban involvement. His role as a CIA Special Assistant for Latin America during a period of intense anti-Castro activities makes his testimony relevant to understanding the broader context of the assassination.",
