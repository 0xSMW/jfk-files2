  "significance": "Mr. Ramon R. Hart's significance in the JFK context, based solely on these documents, is related to his role in the CIA's surveillance of Cuban exile leader Manuel Artime. The surveillance occurred in 1963, the same year as the JFK assassination, and involved monitoring Artime's activities. The documents do not explicitly link this surveillance to the assassination, but they highlight the CIA's interest in and monitoring of Cuban exile groups during this period.",
