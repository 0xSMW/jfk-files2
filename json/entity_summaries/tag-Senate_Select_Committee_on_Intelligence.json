  "summary": "The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) is a key entity involved in overseeing the CIA and other intelligence agencies. The documents reveal the SSCI's interactions with the CIA, particularly concerning access to information related to the Lee Harvey Oswald case and the JFK assassination. The committee sought access to CIA files, leading to internal discussions within the CIA about balancing transparency with the protection of sensitive sources and methods. The Office of Legislative Counsel served as a primary liaison between the CIA and the SSCI, managing information requests, arranging meetings, and ensuring appropriate access to materials. The timeline of involvement spans from 1975 to 1990, with a concentration of activity in the late 1970s. A notable pattern is the CIA's careful management of information released to the SSCI, reflecting concerns about protecting intelligence sources and methods while complying with Congressional oversight.",
