  "summary": "The documents suggest that \"Publicity\" is a concern related to potential exposure of sensitive information or operations. One document discusses avoiding publicity in the apprehension of possible US Army deserters in West Berlin. Another involves an investigation into a magazine article that incorrectly attributed the development of an Identi-kit to U.S. Intelligence, raising concerns about the disclosure of classified information. A third document discusses potential damage to CIA activities in Miami resulting from the Justice Department's decision to seek a Grand Jury indictment against Rolando Masferrer and his associates for a planned Haitian invasion. The common thread is the desire to avoid unwanted attention or exposure of covert activities.",
