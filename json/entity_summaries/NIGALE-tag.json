  "summary": "NIGALE is an intelligence source, likely a person or organization, that the CIA was working with in 1978. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) requested information on the Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO), also known as the Flemish Order of Militants, in connection with its investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. The CIA sought to balance honoring the HSCA's request with preserving its relationship with NIGALE. NIGALE was unwilling to provide information on contacts between VMO members and American citizens between 1968 and 1970 and opposed sharing reports with the House of Representatives committee. The documents indicate a concern within the CIA about jeopardizing the relationship with NIGALE while responding to the HSCA's inquiries.",

  "significance": "NIGALE's significance in the JFK context is indirect. The documents primarily relate to the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination investigation. However, the HSCA's interest in the Flemish Order of Militants (VMO) and the CIA's relationship with NIGALE highlights the broader intelligence landscape and the challenges of balancing investigative requests with maintaining intelligence sources. The documents do not directly implicate NIGALE in the JFK assassination, but rather reveal its role as a source of information that the CIA was hesitant to compromise.",
