  "summary": "Earle G. Wheeler is mentioned in three reports related to countering Cuban subversion in Latin America. The documents detail actions taken by various US government agencies, including the Department of Defense, State Department, and CIA, to control travel to and from Cuba, suppress propaganda, monitor clandestine movements, and strengthen counterinsurgency capabilities. While Wheeler's specific role is not explicitly stated in these documents, the reports suggest he was likely involved in the implementation or oversight of these counter-subversion efforts, given his position within the Department of Defense during this period. The reports span from July 1963 to January 1964, indicating a sustained effort to address Cuban influence in the region.",
