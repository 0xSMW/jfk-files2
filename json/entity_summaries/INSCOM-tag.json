While the provided documents do not directly link INSCOM to the assassination itself, they highlight the organization's involvement in monitoring individuals and gathering information that could potentially be relevant to national security concerns during that era. The investigations into individuals like Richard Nagell, who had connections to figures involved in alleged assassination plots, could indirectly tie INSCOM to the broader context of the JFK assassination.",
