  "summary": "The documents mention Libya in the context of CIA activities and intelligence gathering. One document from 1970 discusses GSFEW/1 personnel stationed in Libya and technical matters related to a radio system. The other three documents from 1998 summarize contacts with intelligence source FCSTANDARD/32 in Addis Ababa, where discussions included Sudan, Libya, and delegations from Israel and Russia. The documents suggest Libya was an area of interest for US intelligence during these periods, warranting the deployment of personnel and the collection of information through human sources. However, the documents do not directly link Libya to the JFK assassination.",
