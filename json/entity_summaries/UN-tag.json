  "summary": "The documents mention the UN primarily in the context of surveillance and intelligence activities related to Soviet and Cuban missions. The FBI conducted mail interception programs targeting the Soviet Mission to the UN. The Cuban UN mission activities were subject to surveillance and intelligence operations, involving coordination between the CIA and FBI. One document refers to \"UN DIP CUBA SLUBAN DETECTOR\" and an immediate action related to it, suggesting a specific operation or concern. Sam Jaffe, a CBS news reporter and FBI informant, provided information on Soviet and satellite nationals in New York City, likely including those associated with the UN. Overall, the UN appears as a location or context for Cold War intelligence activities, particularly concerning Soviet and Cuban interests.",
