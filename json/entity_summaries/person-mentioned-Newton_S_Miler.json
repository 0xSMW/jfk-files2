  "summary": "Newton S. Miler was a consultant whose contract with an unspecified organization was terminated, as indicated by personnel records dated September 30, 1975. Later, in 1978, he is mentioned in journal addenda from the Office of Legislative Counsel concerning liaison activities between the CIA and House and Senate committees, specifically related to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The documents suggest concerns about potential exposure of sensitive CIA operations and inquiries regarding former Agency employees, possibly including Miler, working for foreign governments. The documents do not explicitly state Miler's role in the JFK assassination, but his connection to the CIA and subsequent inquiries about former employees during the HSCA investigation suggest a potential, though undefined, relevance.",
