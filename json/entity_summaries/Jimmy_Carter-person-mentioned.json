  "summary": "Jimmy Carter is mentioned in these documents primarily in the context of a potential security concern during his visit to Venezuela in March 1978. A CIA situation report details potential threats from leftist groups, Cuban exiles, and international terrorists during this visit. He is also mentioned in documents related to Sergyj Czornonoh's claims about Lee Harvey Oswald, where Czornonoh alleges he warned about Oswald's intent to assassinate President Kennedy. The other documents are related to HSCA staff payroll records and Czornonoh's claims about Oswald, and Carter's direct involvement or connection to these topics is not explicitly stated, but his presidency coincides with the time frame of some of these events and investigations.",
