  "summary": "State Department cover refers to the CIA's practice of using the Department of State as a front for its personnel and operations. This involved CIA employees operating under the guise of State Department employees to maintain operational security and conceal their true affiliations. The establishment, maintenance, and cancellation of these covers involved administrative processes, notifications, and record-keeping. The purpose was to protect agents' roles and activities, ensuring their safety and operational effectiveness in sensitive situations, as well as to provide plausible deniability. The JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) investigated the CIA's use of State Cover, raising concerns within the CIA about potential damage to operations and relationships with liaison services.",
