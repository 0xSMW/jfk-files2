  "summary": "The FBI Legat office in Bern, Switzerland, served as a crucial conduit for information related to the JFK assassination and related investigations. The office gathered and disseminated intelligence from various sources, including the Swiss Central Police Bureau, Austrian police, covert CIA personnel (including John Dimmer and a covert CIA Research Branch in Vienna), and other informants. They relayed information to the Director of the FBI and the Dallas field office concerning individuals of interest such as Gus Alex and Mark Lane, detailing their activities and contacts in Switzerland and Austria. The office also reported on interviews, such as one with ANGHEL DRAGOMIR, in connection to the assassination. The period of involvement spans from at least August 1964 to January 1965.",
