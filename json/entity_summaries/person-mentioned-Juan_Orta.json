  "significance": "Juan Orta's significance in the JFK assassination context lies in his potential connection to CIA-sponsored plots against Fidel Castro. The Warren Commission investigated possible links between anti-Castro activities and the assassination of President Kennedy. Orta's involvement, however peripheral, in these activities could be relevant to understanding the broader context of the assassination, particularly if it reveals connections between anti-Castro groups, the CIA, and Lee Harvey Oswald.",
