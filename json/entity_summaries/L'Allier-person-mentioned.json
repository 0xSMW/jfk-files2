The memos indicate that L'Allier was a point of contact within the FBI for CIA requests and information sharing. Specifically, L'Allier received memos from S.J. Papich regarding CIA interests in individuals connected to Cubana Airlines, such as Ismael Rodriguez and Jorge Beliard, who were being considered for potential courier routes between the U.S. and Cuba. The memos also discuss CIA proposals, such as planting articles attacking the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and utilizing individuals like Petros Moutsos in Cuba. L'Allier appears to be a recipient of intelligence and requests from the CIA, suggesting a role in facilitating communication and cooperation between the FBI and CIA during this period.",
