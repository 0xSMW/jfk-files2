  "summary": "The Organization of American States (OAS) is mentioned in the documents primarily in the context of U.S. foreign policy towards Cuba and Latin America during the Cold War era. The documents reveal strategies to influence Latin American governments against Castro's Cuba through the OAS, including leveraging public opinion and media manipulation. The OAS is also referenced in connection with potential subversive activities and policies related to Cuba and Venezuela. One document mentions an OAS captain, Jean Rene Soutre, in relation to a request for documents that may be related to the JFK assassination investigation, though the specific nature of the connection is not detailed. The timeline of involvement spans from the early 1960s to the 1970s, with a focus on the period immediately following the Cuban Revolution and the JFK assassination. A notable pattern is the OAS's role as a forum and target for U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba diplomatically and politically.",
