  "summary": "D.J. Brennan appears to be an FBI official involved in internal communications and intelligence matters during the 1960s and early 1970s. The documents suggest Brennan played a role in managing the flow of information from the CIA, specifically from James Angleton, and in coordinating intelligence activities. Brennan's memos to W.C. Sullivan indicate involvement in establishing and later recommending the discontinuation of a separate control file for CIA information. One document places Brennan in a position to outline the status of FBI-CIA relations, including instances of cooperation. While one document mentions the NSA SIGINT Command Center's activities on the day after the JFK assassination, Brennan's direct involvement in the JFK assassination context is not explicitly stated in these documents. The documents show Brennan's involvement in domestic intelligence matters, as evidenced by the Domestic Intelligence Division inspection report.",
