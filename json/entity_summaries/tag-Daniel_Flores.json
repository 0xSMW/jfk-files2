Flores also swore an oath to support the Constitution in 1962, denying subversive activities. He also filled out a Supplemental Personal History Statement in 1974, providing updated personal details. He is also mentioned in a memo documenting the transfer of AMMUG to a new apartment in Silver Springs, Maryland, though his specific role in this event is not detailed.",
