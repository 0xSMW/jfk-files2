The CIA was monitoring Garrison, as evidenced by a memorandum reporting that MI-5 informed the FBI about Garrison being contacted by the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation to write an article about the Kennedy assassination. The documents span from 1967 to 1998, indicating continued interest and investigation into Garrison's role and theories surrounding the assassination. The NSA also reviewed its files for information related to the assassination, suggesting the broad scope of the investigation and the various leads pursued, some of which likely intersected with Garrison's work.",
