FBI reports detail the VDC's activities, structure, and members, including their involvement in distributing anti-war leaflets. The documents highlight connections between VDC members and various political organizations, including the Fair Play For Cuba Committee, Students for a Democratic Society, Communist Party, and Socialist Workers Party. Robert Scheer, a person of interest in the documents, was associated with the VDC, among other leftist organizations. The documents span from 1966 to 1969, indicating the period of the VDC's activities monitored by the FBI. The documents suggest the FBI was tracking the VDC due to its anti-war stance and connections to other political organizations.",
