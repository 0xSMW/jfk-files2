The documents suggest Roselli's significance lies in his potential knowledge of or involvement in covert operations that could have tangential connections to the JFK assassination. The documents highlight the CIA's involvement in various clandestine activities, and Roselli's association with figures like Robert Maheu and William Harvey, who were central to these operations, suggests a possible link, however indirect, to the events surrounding the assassination.",
