Documents indicate he was involved in relaying messages regarding the recall of U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti, suggesting a role in diplomatic relations. A 1958 CIA dispatch suggests he may have been an informant for the U.S. government and involved in arms deals and casino ventures. The documents span from 1958 to 1963, indicating his activities during this period.",
