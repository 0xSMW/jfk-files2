  "summary": "Harold Bloom is mentioned in the documents as the individual from the 108th MI Gp (I-NYFO) who submitted a request for information on Manuel Marti on September 16, 1968. The request included file checks with the FBI and the New York City Police Department. The results of these checks showed 'no record' or 'nothing derogatory' based on information provided by the NYPD. The documents do not provide further context about Bloom's role or his motivations for requesting this information, nor do they indicate any direct connection to the JFK assassination itself. Bloom's involvement appears to be limited to this specific request for information on Marti.",
