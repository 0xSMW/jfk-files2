  "summary": "AMMUG-1, also referred to as AMMUG/1, was an individual of interest to the CIA during the 1960s and 1970s. Documents suggest AMMUG-1 was a Cuban defector involved in operations in Central America and the Caribbean, with a focus on target analysis and operational leads. The CIA provided logistical and financial support, including safe housing in Silver Spring, Maryland, and cover employment through the Inter-University Committee for Political and Social Action (ICPSA). Concerns arose regarding the security of safehouses and AMMUG-1's cover. In 1968, AMMUG-1 was requested to present in Montevideo to influence the Uruguayan government's intelligence efforts. Later documentation from 1970 relates to securing AMMUG-1's citizenship and potential recruitment approaches towards Roberto Rodriguez Llompart, the brother of a Cuban ambassador. AMMUG-1 was also queried about Manuel ESTEVEZ Perez but could not identify him.",
