  "significance": "While not directly involved in the JFK assassination, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s name appears in documents related to investigations by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The HSCA was tasked with investigating both the JFK and MLK assassinations, leading to inquiries about potential connections or overlapping intelligence matters. The documents reflect the HSCA's efforts to gather information relevant to the MLK assassination, including potential suspects and related organizations. The presence of these documents highlights the broader scope of the HSCA's investigations and the interconnectedness of various intelligence matters during that period.",
