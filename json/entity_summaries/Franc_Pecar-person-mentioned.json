  "summary": "Franc Pecar was a Yugoslav trade official in 1963 who was of interest to both the CIA and FBI. The CIA initially informed the FBI of Pecar's potential desire to defect to the U.S. The FBI, however, advised against approaching Pecar, citing concerns from New York informants and a recent denial of clearance in a similar case. The FBI also informed the CIA that Pecar was being recalled to Yugoslavia. The CIA was interested in contacting Pecar to persuade him to return under their control and tracked his travel plans, including meetings in Miami with Assistant Attorney General William Kenny and a possible recruitment attempt during a visit to Vienna.",

  "significance": "Franc Pecar's significance in the JFK assassination context is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. However, the interest of both the CIA and FBI in him, particularly regarding a potential defection and recruitment, suggests he may have possessed information or connections deemed valuable to U.S. intelligence. The documents do not directly link him to the assassination, but the timing and nature of the agencies' interest warrant further investigation to determine if he had any indirect involvement or knowledge related to events surrounding the assassination.",
