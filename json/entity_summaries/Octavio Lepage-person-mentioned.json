  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Octavio Lepage is mentioned in the context of intelligence information related to Cuban exiles Orlando Bosch and Ricardo Morales Navarrete, and Venezuelan government considerations regarding Bosch's imprisonment. The documents suggest a connection between Lepage and Venezuelan security officials, possibly indicating a role within the Venezuelan government or security apparatus during the period of 1976-1978. The documents do not explicitly detail Lepage's role or significance in the JFK assassination context, but his association with figures like Bosch and Navarrete, who were involved in anti-Castro activities and had connections to the CIA, places him within a network of individuals relevant to understanding the broader landscape of anti-Castro activities and potential connections to the JFK assassination.",
