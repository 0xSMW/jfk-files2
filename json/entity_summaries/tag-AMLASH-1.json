  "summary": "AMLASH-1 was the subject of meetings held in Paris between January 31 and February 3, 1965. These meetings covered a range of topics, including security concerns related to the capture of Modesto Orlando Orozco Basulto, resupply of materials, potential recruitment of individuals into the Cuban Intelligence Service, and information on Cuban officials and political developments. The documents suggest AMLASH-1 was a valuable source of information regarding Cuban intelligence and related matters. The documents do not directly link AMLASH-1 to the JFK assassination, but rather to intelligence gathering operations related to Cuba.",
