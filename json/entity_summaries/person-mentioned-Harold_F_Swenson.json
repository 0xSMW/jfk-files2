  "summary": "Harold F. Swenson was a CIA employee, as evidenced by multiple documents detailing his alias documentation and CIA service. He was assigned the employee number #73086. In 1962, alias documentation was created for him under the name Harold Francis Safley, including a New York State Driver's License, to support his contacts. He was also issued a CIA identification card under the alias 'SAFLEY, Harold F.' while working for Task Force W. In 1967, a retirement medallion was to be presented to him, requiring a check for any cover considerations. One document mentions the rejection of an apartment for AMMUG-1 due to its exposure to KUBARK staffers and agent assets, though Swenson's direct involvement in this event is not explicitly stated.",
