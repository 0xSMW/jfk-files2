  "summary": "Jose Miro Cardona was a prominent leader within the Cuban exile community, deeply involved in anti-Castro activities. He played a key role in the Cuban Revolutionary Council, and his potential resignation reflected his influence and concerns about U.S. policy shifts towards Cuba. Cardona actively sought U.S. support, including arms and military assistance, for aggressive actions against the Castro regime, proposing plans for propaganda, underground operations, and a commando raid. He also coordinated with other nations, such as Guatemala (Carlos Alejos), to garner support for removing Castro from power and establishing a new government on Cuban soil.",
