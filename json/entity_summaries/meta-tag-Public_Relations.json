  "summary": "The documents reveal that public relations, encompassing media relations and publicity, played a significant role in various CIA activities, government communications, and international relations. The CIA used media outlets for operational support, intelligence gathering, and propaganda dissemination, while also attempting to manage and control the narrative surrounding sensitive operations and potential leaks. Concerns about publicity were paramount, particularly regarding covert operations, the JFK assassination, and potential connections to individuals like Lee Harvey Oswald. The agency sought to protect its reputation and maintain operational security by managing its image and relationships with the media and other entities, sometimes engaging in covert use of media and suppressing information.",
