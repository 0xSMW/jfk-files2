  "summary": "The documents reveal that 'Counter-Insurgency' efforts, encompassing strategies against subversion and guerrilla warfare, were a significant focus of U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War, particularly in the early 1960s. These efforts, coordinated by various U.S. government agencies like the CIA, Department of State, and Department of Defense, aimed to combat Castro-Communist subversion and Cuban influence in Latin America, specifically Cuba and Venezuela, and also extended to Southeast Asia, including South Vietnam. Activities included controlling travel, disrupting the clandestine movement of guerrillas and arms, strengthening local armed forces, and implementing programs like the Strategic Hamlets. Cuban exiles and other groups employed guerrilla warfare tactics, receiving support from Cuba in the form of training and resources. The U.S. government was concerned about the spread of communism and actively worked to bolster counterinsurgency capabilities in allied nations.",
