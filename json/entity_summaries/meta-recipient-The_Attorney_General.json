  "summary": "The Attorney General appears in these documents primarily as the recipient of information and requests from the FBI. They were informed about the FBI's responses to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) regarding sensitive matters such as investigations into Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Furthermore, the Attorney General's authorization was sought by the FBI for technical surveillance and other investigative activities related to individuals and groups suspected of espionage, Communist activities, racketeering, and involvement in domestic extremist organizations, spanning from 1954 to 1972. This highlights the Attorney General's crucial role in overseeing law enforcement and national security matters through their approval of sensitive investigative measures.",
