  "summary": "The documents primarily consist of payroll and certification reports from the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). These reports detail the salaries of the committee's employees, including their positions, annual salaries, and pay period earnings. The reports cover various periods, mainly from 1977 to 1979, and provide a record of the financial aspects of the committee's operations. The documents list employee names, social security numbers, positions, salaries, and employment dates for specific accounting periods. A notable pattern is the consistent reporting of employee compensation details, reflecting the HSCA's administrative functions.",
