  "summary": "The Senate Select Committee (SSC) was a body formed to investigate intelligence activities. The documents provided indicate the SSC was actively investigating the FBI's activities, including surveillance of individuals like Martin Luther King Jr. and organizations like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The SSC also examined FBI's informant programs, such as the one involving Douglas Durham within the American Indian Movement (AIM). The documents highlight the FBI's coordination with the SSC, the sharing of information, and the White House's review of intelligence matters related to the SSC's inquiries. Alan G. Sentinella's testimony before the SSC reveals details about investigations into Martin Luther King, Jr., the SCLC, and Stanley Levison, focusing on telephone surveillance and alleged communist connections.",
