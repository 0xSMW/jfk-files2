  "summary": "Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, appears in these documents primarily in the context of CIA station activities and investigations related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Orlando Letelier. CIA stations in Caracas were instructed on how to interact with the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigators, emphasizing the need to restrict comments to cover activities. Investigations into the assassination of Orlando Letelier explored potential connections to Venezuelan secret police. Furthermore, following the attempt on President Kennedy's life, Venezuelan army units were placed on alert. The documents suggest that Caracas served as a location for CIA operations and a point of interest in investigations related to political assassinations during the 1960s and 1970s.",
