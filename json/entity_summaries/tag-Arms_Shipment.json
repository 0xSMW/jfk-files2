Another mentions FEU's arms purchase in the context of rebel activities in Cuba in 1958. The third document describes a request from the Communist Party of El Salvador for explosives to be sent via Mexico, and Cuba's decision to send money instead due to exposure of arms shipments to Venezuela in 1964. The documents highlight the clandestine nature of these shipments and their connection to political and revolutionary movements in the region.",
