  "summary": "NIGALE is an intelligence source or entity, likely based in Brussels, that the CIA had a relationship with in 1978. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) requested information on the Flemish Order of Militants (VMO) in connection with its investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. The CIA sought guidance on how to respond to the HSCA request while preserving the relationship with NIGALE. NIGALE was unwilling to provide information on contacts between Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO) members and American citizens between 1968 and 1970 and was opposed to sharing reports with the House of Representatives committee. The documents indicate a concern within the CIA about balancing cooperation with the HSCA investigation and maintaining a positive relationship with NIGALE.",

  "significance": "NIGALE's significance in the JFK context is indirect. The documents primarily relate to the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination investigation, where the HSCA sought information on the Flemish Order of Militants (VMO). NIGALE's unwillingness to cooperate with the HSCA's request raises questions about the nature of its relationship with the VMO and the information it possessed. However, there is no direct mention of the JFK assassination in these documents.",
