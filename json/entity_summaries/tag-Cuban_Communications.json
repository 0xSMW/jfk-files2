  "summary": "Cuban Communications, as referenced in the documents, pertain to intercepted communications involving Cuba, particularly between 1962 and 1964. These communications were of interest to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in their investigation into the JFK assassination. The NSA intercepted and analyzed these communications, seeking insights into Cuban activities in the Western Hemisphere and their reactions to President Kennedy's assassination. The documents reveal that the NSA conducted searches for Cuban communications related to specific individuals and events, but faced challenges due to the destruction of raw traffic data. The communications included Soviet military communications between Moscow and Havana, Soviet communications within Cuba, Soviet air and air defense communications, and Cuban communications, including ground processes and naval activities. While the NSA initially reported no intelligence material revealing Cuban involvement in the assassination, the intercepted communications provided insights into Cuban agent activities.",
