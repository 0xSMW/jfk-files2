  "summary": "Portugal appears in the JFK assassination context primarily in relation to potential leads investigated by the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concerning James Earl Ray, the assassin of Martin Luther King Jr. The HSCA was exploring possible connections or leads Ray may have had in Portugal, the UK, and Mexico. Additionally, Portuguese intelligence monitored Fidel Castro's reaction to President Kennedy's assassination, reporting his fear of U.S. retaliation and attempts to deflect blame. Portugal also had more time to lobby for votes in the UN due to the adjournment following President Kennedy's assassination.",
