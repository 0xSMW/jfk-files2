  "summary": "The documents consist of summaries, transcripts, and reports related to interviews, debriefings, and interrogations conducted by agencies such as the HSCA, CIA, and FBI. These activities aimed to gather information from a variety of individuals, including those connected to the JFK assassination (such as Lee Harvey Oswald and his associates), defectors from Cuba and the Soviet Union, and individuals of interest to intelligence agencies. The topics covered range from Oswald's activities and potential motives to CIA operations, security protocols, and potential conspiracies. Interrogation was also used to assess the credibility and gather intelligence from defectors and other individuals involved in espionage-related activities, with methods including psychological testing and psychiatric evaluations.",
