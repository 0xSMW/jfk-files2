Santo Trafficante, Jr.'s alleged presence in Las Vegas is also mentioned. The documents suggest that Las Vegas was a place where these individuals conducted business, met with associates, and potentially engaged in activities of interest to the FBI. The timeline spans from 1962 to 1966, with a concentration of reports in late 1962 and 1963. A notable pattern is the repeated tracking of John Rosselli's movements and financial transactions in relation to Las Vegas.",
