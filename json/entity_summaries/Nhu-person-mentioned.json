  "significance": "Ngo Dinh Nhu's significance in the JFK context stems from his central role in the increasingly unstable South Vietnamese government, which was a major foreign policy challenge for the Kennedy administration. His actions and policies, along with those of his brother President Diem, contributed to the growing US involvement in Vietnam and the eventual US support for a coup that led to their assassinations in November 1963. This event had significant implications for US foreign policy and the escalation of the Vietnam War.",
