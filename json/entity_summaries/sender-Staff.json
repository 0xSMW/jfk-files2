  "summary": "STAFF refers to CIA staff, often acting as the sender of cables and messages related to various operational matters, including those pertaining to the JFK assassination. Their role involves handling intelligence, coordinating with stations and assets, responding to requests from the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), and managing information related to individuals and events connected to the assassination. They are involved in tasks such as requesting information, providing assessments, seeking assistance from stations, and addressing concerns about the declassification of sensitive documents. The timeline of their involvement spans from the 1970s to the late 1990s, reflecting ongoing efforts to manage and respond to inquiries related to the JFK assassination records. A notable pattern across the documents is their consistent role in facilitating information flow, managing sensitive information, and addressing the implications of declassification requests related to the JFK assassination.",
