  "summary": "Carlos Andres Perez was the President of Venezuela during the period covered by these documents. His significance stems from his alleged protection of Cuban exile leader Orlando Bosch in Venezuela during late September to mid-October 1976, as indicated in one document related to the Cubana Airlines bombing. The documents suggest that Bosch was operating under Perez's protection during this period. Other documents mention Venezuelan security officials possibly being U.S. intelligence agents, and the Venezuelan government's considerations regarding Orlando Bosch's imprisonment and potential release. While the documents do not directly link Perez to the JFK assassination, his association with figures like Orlando Bosch, who were involved in anti-Castro activities and implicated in acts of violence, places him within the broader network of individuals and events relevant to understanding the political climate and actors of the time.",
