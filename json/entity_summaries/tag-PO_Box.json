  "summary": "The documents reference P.O. boxes in two distinct contexts. One involves a P.O. box in Coral Gables, Florida, linked to the identifier \"GRACE HOLMES,\" mentioned in classified messages sent to multiple CIA stations in December 1963. The other concerns a P.O. box in Washington, D.C., established in April 1972 under the alias \"Diego S. Mardones\" for Officer Gilbert Richmond. The Coral Gables P.O. box appears in the context of potentially sensitive or clandestine communications, while the Washington D.C. P.O. box is related to internal CIA security measures.",

  "significance": "The significance of the P.O. boxes lies in their potential use for covert communications or operational security within the CIA. The Coral Gables P.O. box, specifically, raises questions about its connection to \"Grace Holmes\" and the nature of the classified messages referencing it, potentially linking to broader intelligence activities. The Washington D.C. P.O. box illustrates the CIA's use of aliases and secure mail drops for its personnel.",
