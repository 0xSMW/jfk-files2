  "summary": "Contact Reports are a recurring document type detailing interactions between CIA personnel and various individuals, including foreign officials, assets, and potential sources. These reports cover a wide range of topics, from intelligence gathering on Soviet and Cuban activities to discussions on personal matters and career aspirations. In the context of the JFK assassination, some contact reports touch upon individuals who expressed interest in or were connected to JFK assassination theories, such as MXWINDFALL/1 and BRACERB/17. These reports also document surveillance activities and intelligence gathering related to Soviet officials like Valentin LOGINOV in Mexico, which is relevant due to Lee Harvey Oswald's time in Mexico City prior to the assassination. The reports span from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, indicating a sustained effort in gathering intelligence through human sources.",
