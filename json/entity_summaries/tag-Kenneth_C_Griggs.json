  "summary": "Kenneth C. Griggs is a PFC born in Korea and later adopted by Cecil L. Griggs. He is identified as a defector. The documents primarily consist of exhibit cover sheets and an agent report related to correspondence and information provided by Philip LaChapelle Jr., a former Security and Intelligence clerk, concerning Griggs' experiences prior to his defection. These experiences allegedly include mistreatment and emotional issues. The documents are dated January 24, 1968, and involve letters exchanged between LaChapelle and Cecil Griggs, discussing Kenneth's background and experiences. The focus seems to be on understanding the circumstances surrounding Griggs' defection through the accounts of those who knew him.",
