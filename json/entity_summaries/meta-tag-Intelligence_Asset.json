These assets come from diverse backgrounds, such as journalists, political figures, industrial engineers, doctors, and individuals with connections to regimes or individuals of interest. The documents, spanning from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, highlight the importance of managing these assets, including security considerations, remuneration, operational protocols, and risk mitigation related to potential exposure or hostility. The recruitment and use of assets involved coordination between different CIA departments and other government agencies.",
