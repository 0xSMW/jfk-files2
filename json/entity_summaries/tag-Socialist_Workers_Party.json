  "summary": "The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is mentioned in the context of FBI investigations and reports concerning leftist political organizations. The documents suggest the FBI was monitoring individuals associated with the SWP and other groups like the Vietnam Day Committee (VDC) and the Communist Party. The documents do not directly link the SWP to the JFK assassination, but rather highlight the FBI's surveillance and counterintelligence activities against various political groups during the 1960s and 1970s. One document involves a recommendation to reject an individual for service due to affiliations with the SWP and other leftist organizations, indicating the perceived threat these groups posed at the time.",
