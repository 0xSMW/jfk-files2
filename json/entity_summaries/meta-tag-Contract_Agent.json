  "summary": "The documents discuss 'Contract Agents' and related terms ('Agent', 'Double Agent', 'Career Agent', 'Soviet Agents') primarily in the context of CIA and FBI operations, intelligence gathering, and covert activities from the 1950s to the 1970s. These agents, including double agents used in Cuban intelligence and counterintelligence, were employed for various purposes, such as intelligence collection, infiltration, sabotage, and guerilla warfare. They operated in different locations, including Cuba, Mexico, and Panama. The documents highlight aspects of agent recruitment, training, management, security protocols, and potential risks associated with their use, including dual loyalties. Career Agents held positions requiring security considerations and non-official cover. Soviet Agents are mentioned in connection with investigations and intelligence gathering efforts aimed at monitoring Soviet activities during the Cold War era. Contract Agents were employed on a contractual basis, potentially placed on retainer through firms, housed at covert sites, and undergoing security clearances.",
