  "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy, also known as RFK, served as Attorney General during the Kennedy administration and played a significant role in various sensitive operations, particularly those related to Cuba and anti-Castro efforts. He was a key figure in Operation Mongoose, a covert program aimed at destabilizing the Cuban government and potentially assassinating Fidel Castro. The documents also reflect his oversight of FBI activities, including investigations related to Martin Luther King, Jr. Following President Kennedy's assassination, Robert Kennedy was considered a potential successor, and his own assassination in 1968 is noted in some reports. The documents also allude to potential external influences and scrutiny of his actions as Attorney General, including alleged connections to Sam Giancana.",
