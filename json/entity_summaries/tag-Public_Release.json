  "summary": "The 'Public Release' tag in these documents refers to the process mandated by the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which required the review and potential release of documents related to the JFK assassination. The CIA was tasked with identifying individuals whose names appeared in these documents and informing them of the potential public release. This involved contacting former employees residing in various locations (Vienna, Caracas, Costa Rica) to offer them the opportunity to provide reasons why their names should not be released. The process aimed to balance transparency with the privacy concerns of individuals mentioned in the records.",
