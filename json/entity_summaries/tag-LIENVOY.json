  "summary": "LIENVOY was a CIA project involving surveillance operations against Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City. It is significant in the JFK assassination context because it involved monitoring contacts made by Lee Harvey Oswald before the assassination. The project included telephone intercepts of Cuban, Soviet, Czech, and Yugoslav embassies, as well as key individuals. The operations ran from January 1962 to December 1963, with ongoing support activities documented into 1964. Documents reveal requests for clarification on the status and reliability of sources involved in the project, such as LIENVOY-8, and concerns about security. The Mexico City Station's operational activities, including those against Soviet, Cuban, and satellite targets, were part of the LIENVOY project.",
