  "summary": "Headquarters, in the context of these documents, appears to be a central authority responsible for directing and overseeing operations, investigations, and intelligence gathering. The documents indicate a role in managing credit blocks for individuals, directing field offices in investigations (as seen in the Peter Paul Gregory case), and disseminating intelligence reports on matters of national security, such as suspected Cuban security penetrations. The documents span from 1965 to 1996, suggesting a long-term involvement in various operational and intelligence activities. A notable pattern is the directive nature of Headquarters, issuing instructions and disseminating information to other entities.",
