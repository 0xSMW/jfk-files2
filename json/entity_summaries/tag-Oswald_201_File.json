  "summary": "The Oswald 201 File is a collection of documents related to Lee Harvey Oswald and his connections, particularly within the context of the JFK assassination records. The CIA's approach to reviewing and releasing these records, including sanitization and privacy concerns, is a central theme. The file's contents were discussed in meetings with the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). Specific locations, such as German and Swiss locations, were considered regarding their release within the Oswald 201 file, with some locations being protected while others were deemed releasable. The file appears to be a key component in the broader effort to declassify and release information related to the JFK assassination.",
