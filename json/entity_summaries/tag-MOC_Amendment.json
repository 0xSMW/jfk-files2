  "summary": "MOC (Memorandum of Oral Commitment) Amendments pertain to modifications of agreements, specifically concerning individuals working with JMWAVE. These amendments primarily involve adjustments to salary, funding mechanisms, and tax obligations. The documents highlight changes in compensation, such as salary increases due to dependents, and shifts in how individuals are paid, including moving them onto the JMWAVE payroll with tax deductions instead of requiring covert income tax returns. These amendments ensure that individuals are compensated appropriately and that their financial arrangements align with operational requirements.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, MOC Amendments themselves do not directly relate to the assassination. However, they provide insight into the operational and financial aspects of individuals working with or for organizations like JMWAVE during the time period relevant to the assassination. Understanding these operational details can help contextualize the activities and relationships of individuals who may have been involved in events surrounding the assassination.",
