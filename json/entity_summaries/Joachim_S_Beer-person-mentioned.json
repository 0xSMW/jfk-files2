  "summary": "Joachim S. Beer, also known as Joachim F. Pehl, is the step-son of Henry S. Beer. According to agent reports from March 1971, a local agency check revealed derogatory information from the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO) regarding incidents involving Joachim, including a report of a fire and disturbing the peace while serving in the US Army Berlin Brigade. A cable from BLN STA 66th MI GP to CO 66th MI GP CI DIV, dated March 10, 1971, reports that LAC's and MAC's checks on Joachim were negative or non-derogatory, except for a disturbing the peace incident. The cable also details Joachim Raf. Beer's background as a former labor service employee and his immigration processing.",

Beer appears to be the primary reason for his inclusion in these records.",
