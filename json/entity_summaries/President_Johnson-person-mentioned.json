  "summary": "President Lyndon B. Johnson is mentioned in several documents related to the JFK assassination and associated investigations. His name appears in the context of the Warren Commission, potential Cuban government policy shifts following Kennedy's assassination, and concerns about documents prejudicial to him being offered for sale. Documents also reference the Assassination Records Review Board's (ARRB) interactions with the Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) Library. The documents suggest that his administration and image were of concern in the aftermath of the assassination, and that efforts were made to manage information related to him in connection with the JFK investigation. One document indicates that Fidel Castro was initially upset by Kennedy's assassination and sought to avoid irritating President Johnson, suggesting a potential shift in Cuban-US relations. Overall, the documents portray President Johnson as a figure of interest and concern in the context of the JFK assassination and its aftermath.",
