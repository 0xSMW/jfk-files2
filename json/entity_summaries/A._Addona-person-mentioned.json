  "summary": "A. Addona appears as an intermediary in the routing of memoranda regarding the classification of document EX 3600. Specifically, memoranda from P. Haefner (or J. Haffner) to J.D. Lavery of OGC are routed 'via A. Addona.' The memoranda concern the justification for classifying document EX 3600, citing its connection to Operation MHCHAOS and the inclusion of information from sensitive sources and classified FBI reports. Addona's role seems to be administrative, facilitating the flow of information between Haefner/Haffner and Lavery.",
