  "summary": "Economic warfare, as depicted in the provided documents, was a component of the CIA's covert actions against Cuba, particularly during the early 1960s. The strategy involved applying economic pressure to destabilize the Castro regime. This included efforts to isolate Cuba economically, disrupt its trade relationships, and generally undermine its economy. The documents highlight that economic warfare was part of a broader strategy that also included intelligence gathering, psychological warfare, and potential support for internal resistance. These efforts were intensified following the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the aim of continuing to weaken the Cuban government without direct military intervention. The operational plans were designed to exploit any vulnerabilities within the Cuban system and its relationships with other nations.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, economic warfare against Cuba is significant as it represents one facet of the intense hostility and covert actions directed at the Castro regime during the Kennedy administration. While the documents do not directly link economic warfare to the assassination, they illustrate the environment of clandestine operations and the Kennedy administration's focus on destabilizing Cuba, which some theories suggest may have contributed to the circumstances surrounding the assassination.",
