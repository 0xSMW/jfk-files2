He is mentioned as the Secretary of Defense receiving a memorandum analyzing Soviet policy, and his name appears in an inventory of Rockefeller Commission files related to the Kennedy assassination. This suggests he was in a position to be informed about relevant intelligence matters, but the documents do not directly implicate him in any specific actions related to the assassination itself.",
