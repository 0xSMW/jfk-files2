  "summary": "Silvia Duran was an employee of the Cuban consulate in Mexico City in 1963. Her significance in the JFK assassination context stems from her interactions with Lee Harvey Oswald when he visited the consulate in September 1963 seeking a visa to travel to Cuba and potentially the Soviet Union. Documents detail a chronology of Oswald's visits and descriptions of his interactions with Duran. Following the assassination, Duran was interrogated by Mexican authorities about Oswald's visa application. A Cuban letter of protest to Mexico alleges Duran was mistreated during this interrogation and implicates the CIA in a conspiracy related to the Kennedy assassination, accusing Mexican police of complicity with those who planned Kennedy's assassination. The HSCA investigated the CIA's knowledge of Oswald and Duran in Mexico City.",
