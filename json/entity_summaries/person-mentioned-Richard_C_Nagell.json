  "summary": "Richard C. Nagell is mentioned in connection to the case of Victor L. Trinkala, an underage soldier who sought discharge from the U.S. Army. The documents suggest Nagell may have intervened to prevent Trinkala's deployment to Vietnam, possibly due to Trinkala's status as a conscientious objector. An agent report details a local agency check regarding Post Office Box 2337, which is registered to Richard C. Nagell at 2292 Edythe Drive, Dundeon, Florida. Another agent report details an interview with Harfez Muneer regarding Richard Nagell's connections to Victor L. Trinkala's separation from military service as a conscientious objector. Trinkala himself acknowledged limited contact with Nagell, believing Nagell helped him get discharged. The documents suggest an investigation into Nagell's possible involvement in assisting Trinkala's discharge.",
