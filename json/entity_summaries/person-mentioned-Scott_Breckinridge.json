  "summary": "Scott Breckinridge was a CIA official involved in liaising with the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) during its investigation into the JFK assassination in 1978. He is mentioned in documents related to the CIA's concerns about the HSCA's investigation potentially exposing sensitive CIA operations and inquiries related to former Agency employees. One document specifically details a request from G. Robert Blakey, likely the HSCA's chief counsel, to Breckinridge for assistance in arranging interviews in Mexico with individuals of interest to the committee. This suggests Breckinridge played a role in facilitating the HSCA's access to information and individuals relevant to their investigation, while also navigating the CIA's concerns about protecting sensitive information.",
