  "summary": "Huey P. Newton, a key figure in the Black Panther Party (BPP), is mentioned in these documents primarily in the context of FBI surveillance and monitoring of the BPP. The documents do not directly link Newton to the JFK assassination. Instead, they focus on the BPP's activities, alleged extremist views, and the FBI's efforts to gather intelligence on the organization. One document mentions Bobby Seale's visit to Norway and his views on the BPP, providing indirect context to Newton's role as a leader within the party. The documents highlight the FBI's interest in the BPP as a potential threat to national security during the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
