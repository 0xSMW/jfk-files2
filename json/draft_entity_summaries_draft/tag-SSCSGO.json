  "significance": "The significance of SSCSGO is that it categorizes documents related to the Church Committee's investigation into various CIA activities. While the documents do not directly mention the JFK assassination, the investigations into the CIA's activities, including potential abuses of power and covert operations, are relevant to understanding the broader context of the intelligence community during that era, which is often scrutinized in discussions surrounding the JFK assassination.",
