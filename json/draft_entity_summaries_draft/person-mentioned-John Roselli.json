He is mentioned in relation to the Senate Select Committee's (Church Committee) investigation into the CIA's \"executive action\" capability, Project ZR/RIFLE, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigation into the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The documents indicate that Roselli's involvement was significant enough to warrant investigation by both the SSCIA and HSCA.",
