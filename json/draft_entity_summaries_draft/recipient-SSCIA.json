The documents reveal that the SSCIA investigated topics such as Operation Mongoose, ZRRIFLE, CIA's relationship with Cuban exiles, mail opening projects, and alleged assassination plans involving foreign leaders. The committee sought to understand the extent of CIA involvement in activities that might have relevance to the JFK assassination, including potential plots against Fidel Castro and other foreign leaders.
