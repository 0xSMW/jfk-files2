  "summary": "NITRUST appears to be a liaison contact, possibly within an intelligence agency, based in Brussels. In May 1978, NITRUST was involved in requests for information related to the Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO), a Flemish militant order, also known as the 'Flemish Order of Militants'. NITRUST was reluctant to share information with the House Committee on Assassinations regarding potential contacts between VMO members and American citizens, citing concerns about information leaks and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This reluctance suggests NITRUST held sensitive information that they were unwilling to disclose, potentially hindering investigations related to the JFK assassination.",

The VMO's possible connections to American citizens and NITRUST's unwillingness to disclose information raises questions about the extent of foreign involvement and the transparency of intelligence agencies in the investigation.",
