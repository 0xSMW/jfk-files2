He is responsible for providing information and records to the ARRB, addressing issues such as the release of CIA information, including the location of the CIA Record Center, the opening of Nosenko NBR material, information on CIA employees under State cover, and Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) financial records. He also deals with sensitive information like 'Aquatic' slug line protection, photo operations in Mexico City, personnel files, covert actions, alias documentation, organizational materials, Mexico City tapes, and CIA assets. Harrelson informs Teresa Wilcox about the status of 'Aquatic' slug line protection and the ARRB's stance on its release in documents, particularly concerning photo operations in Mexico City, advising her on the necessity of proving 'current harm' for continued protection and suggesting review options for related files. He forwards ARRB requests for additional information and records related to the Mexico City Station, citing specific footnotes and requesting copies of source documents pertaining to personnel, operations, and investigations linked to Lee Harvey Oswald. The documents span from 1996 to 1998, indicating his involvement during that period.",
