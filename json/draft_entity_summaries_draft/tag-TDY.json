  "summary": "TDY, which stands for Temporary Duty, appears in the documents primarily as a logistical or administrative marker related to travel assignments. One document mentions MXWINDFALL/1's TDY trip to Russia, which includes attending a JFK assassination conference, indicating a tangential connection to the JFK assassination context. Another document discusses security clearance for an individual's PCS (Permanent Change of Station) or TDY assignment. The third document refers to a paroled Cuban's TDY travel to Argentina. The common thread is that TDY signifies a temporary work assignment requiring travel, but its direct involvement in the JFK assassination is limited to the mention of a conference on the topic during one individual's TDY trip.",
