  "summary": "The documents provided do not explicitly mention a \"Budget Officer\" by name. Instead, they primarily concern payroll records and Final Determination Notifications from the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) regarding the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) staff payroll. These records include payroll authorization forms, memoranda, and notifications related to the postponement of Social Security numbers to protect personal privacy. The documents detail the employment, salary adjustments, and positions of various HSCA staff members. The ARRB's notifications address the balance between public interest and individual privacy when releasing payroll information. The documents span from 1976 to 1995, with the ARRB reviewing HSCA records much later.",
