  "summary": "Payroll certification within the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) context refers to the process of verifying and authorizing employee payroll. The documents indicate that payroll certification was a standard administrative procedure involving forms and memoranda detailing employee salaries, positions, and any adjustments or terminations. A recurring pattern across the documents is the inclusion of payroll authorization forms alongside memos specifically addressing payroll certification requirements. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) also played a role, as evidenced by Final Determination Notifications regarding the postponement of information, such as Social Security numbers, in HSCA staff payroll records due to privacy concerns. The documents span from 1976 to 1977, with a later review by the ARRB in 1995.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination records, payroll certification is significant as it provides documentation of the HSCA's staffing and financial operations during its investigation. While not directly related to the assassination itself, these records offer insights into the committee's internal workings and the individuals involved in the inquiry. The ARRB's involvement highlights the balance between transparency and privacy when releasing historical records.",
