  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, the term \"Asylum\" appears to be used in the context of individuals seeking refuge or defecting from countries, particularly Cuba. The documents highlight instances of individuals seeking asylum or defecting due to political or ideological reasons, such as Luis Alberto de Jesus Condom Cajigal rejoining the anti-communist underground in Cuba and the debriefing of a Cuban defector (CEELLANA). While the documents do not explicitly link \"Asylum\" directly to the JFK assassination, the broader context suggests that the concept of asylum is relevant to understanding the political climate and tensions of the time, particularly concerning Cold War conflicts and defections from communist regimes. The documents do not provide a specific timeline of involvement for \"Asylum\" as it is a general concept rather than a specific entity.",
