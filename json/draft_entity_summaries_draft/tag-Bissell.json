Documents reference his interactions with individuals like Helms, McCone, and Harvey, indicating his high-level involvement in CIA operations.

These operations, which included potential assassination attempts against Fidel Castro, are relevant to the JFK assassination context because they suggest a climate of intense anti-Castro sentiment and a willingness to engage in extreme measures, potentially creating a motive for individuals or groups to take action against President Kennedy.",
