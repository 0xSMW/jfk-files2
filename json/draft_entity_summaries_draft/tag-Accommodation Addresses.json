  "summary": "Accommodation addresses, in the context of these documents, appear to be addresses used by agents, particularly in covert operations, to provide a safe or anonymous location. They are mentioned in relation to CIA activities, specifically concerning agents dispatched to Cuba from Mexico in 1961 and in discussions regarding the release of assassination records in the 1990s. The CIA sought to postpone the release of information related to accommodation addresses, citing potential damage to diplomatic relations, litigation, and intelligence collection methods. Some accommodation addresses were cancelled in 1961. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) engaged with the CIA to balance transparency with the protection of sensitive information related to these addresses.",
