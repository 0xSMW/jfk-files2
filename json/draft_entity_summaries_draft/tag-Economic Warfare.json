  "summary": "Economic warfare, as depicted in the provided documents, refers to a component of the CIA's covert operations against Cuba, particularly during the early 1960s. These operations aimed to destabilize the Cuban regime under Fidel Castro through economic pressure. The documents outline plans to isolate and discredit the Castro regime by maintaining economic and political pressures. This involved strategies to undermine the Cuban economy, potentially through sabotage or other means, as part of a broader effort to weaken the government and create conditions for internal resistance or regime change. The timeline of involvement is primarily focused on the period following the Cuban Missile Crisis, specifically late 1962, although the broader \"Cuba Project\" initiated earlier in 1962 also included economic elements.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, economic warfare against Cuba is significant as it represents one facet of the intense U.S. efforts to destabilize the Castro regime. While the documents do not directly link economic warfare to the assassination, they illustrate the broader context of covert actions and animosity between the U.S. and Cuba, which some theories suggest played a role in the events surrounding President Kennedy's death. The documents highlight the CIA's active role in planning and executing operations against Cuba, contributing to a climate of hostility and potential motivations for actors both within and outside the U.S. government.",
