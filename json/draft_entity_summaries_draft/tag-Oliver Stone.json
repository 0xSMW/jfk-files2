  "summary": "Oliver Stone is mentioned in the context of documents related to the JFK assassination records. While the documents do not directly detail Stone's involvement, they appear in collections of materials related to the assassination. The documents include correspondence between the CIA and the House and Senate regarding the release of JFK assassination records, a memo discussing the JFK Board's decision to release the true name of Jose Marie Mankel, and a dispatch reporting on an unsolicited fax sent to the Denver NVTAG office from Robert Plumlee, who claims a former association with NWBOLTON and alleges he sabotaged a Denver Magazine article related to the assassination trail. The presence of these documents suggests that Oliver Stone's work or interest in the JFK assassination is a factor in the collection and review of these materials.",
