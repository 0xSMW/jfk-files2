  "summary": "Phillip Agee is mentioned in the context of CIA activities in Mexico City. Specifically, his book is referenced in a CIA memorandum requesting reconsideration of certain releases of security classified HSCA testimony of John Scelso. The CIA was concerned about releasing information related to a political action program in Mexico City and liaison with Mexican police, which Agee's book may have covered. While the documents do not explicitly detail Agee's role in the JFK assassination, the reference to his book suggests it contained information relevant to CIA operations that the agency sought to protect from disclosure.",
