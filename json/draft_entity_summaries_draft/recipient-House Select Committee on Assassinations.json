  "summary": "The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) is referenced in three documents. While the documents themselves do not directly detail the HSCA's activities or findings, their presence as recipients suggests the committee's role in investigating matters related to assassinations or related intelligence activities. The documents include files on William P. Burke Jr., Chief of the New Orleans Field Office, interactions with Soviet officials like Valentin Sergeyevich Loganov in Mexico, and information on Cuban exile leader Manuel Ray. The HSCA's receipt of these documents implies their investigation encompassed a broad range of individuals and events potentially relevant to their mandate.",
