  "summary": "Elizabeth Berning's name appears in 22 documents related to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) payroll records. The documents primarily consist of payroll authorization forms, memoranda, and Final Determination Notifications from the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB). These notifications often concern the postponement of the release of Social Security numbers from HSCA staff payroll records due to privacy concerns. While the documents confirm Berning was an HSCA staff member, they do not provide specific details about her role, responsibilities, or timeline of involvement within the committee. The consistent pattern across these documents is the redaction or postponement of Social Security numbers to protect personal privacy, a common practice in the release of these records.",

  "significance": "Elizabeth Berning's significance in the JFK context is limited to her employment with the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The available documents do not provide enough information to determine her specific role or contribution to the HSCA's investigation. Her inclusion in payroll records indicates she was a staff member, but the absence of further details makes it difficult to assess her direct impact on the JFK or Martin Luther King Jr. assassination investigations.",
