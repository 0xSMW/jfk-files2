  "summary": "NIGALE is an intelligence source, likely a person or organization, that the CIA had a relationship with in 1978. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) requested information on the Flemish Order of Militants (VMO) in connection with its investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. The CIA sought guidance on how to respond to the HSCA request while preserving the relationship with NIGALE. NIGALE was unwilling to provide information on contacts between Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO) members and American citizens between 1968 and 1970, and was opposed to sharing quarterly or semi-annual reports with a House of Representatives committee. NIGALE declined to prepare a report on the Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO) for the House of Representatives Committee, citing a lack of information on VMO-American citizen contacts between 1968 and 1970.",

  "significance": "NIGALE's significance in the JFK context is indirect. The documents primarily relate to the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination investigation. However, the documents reveal the CIA's concern about preserving its relationship with NIGALE while responding to the HSCA's requests, indicating NIGALE was a valuable intelligence source. The refusal of NIGALE to cooperate with the House of Representatives committee is also notable.",
