  "summary": "The documents highlight diplomatic relations as a sensitive area potentially impacted by the release of classified information related to the JFK assassination. One document mentions a CIA proposal to postpone the release of alias documentation and accommodation addresses, citing potential damage to diplomatic relations as a key reason. Another document discusses the potential severance of diplomatic relations between Cambodia and South Vietnam in 1962, indicating the volatility of international relations during this period. A third document describes the Cuban government's policy of avoiding irritating President Johnson after President Kennedy's assassination, suggesting a cautious approach to potentially improving relations between Cuba and the United States. These documents collectively illustrate the importance of diplomatic considerations in the context of both intelligence operations and international relations during the Cold War era, and how these considerations could influence decisions related to the release of information about the JFK assassination.",
