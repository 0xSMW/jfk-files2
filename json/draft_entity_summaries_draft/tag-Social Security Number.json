  "summary": "Social Security Numbers (SSNs) appear in the context of House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) staff payroll records. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) issued Final Determination Notifications regarding the release of these records, frequently postponing the release of SSNs to protect personal privacy. This postponement is a recurring pattern across the documents. The documents themselves consist of payroll authorization forms, leave records, memoranda, and other personnel-related paperwork for HSCA staff members. The redaction or postponement of SSNs highlights the balance between transparency and the protection of personal information within the context of historical records related to the JFK assassination investigation.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination records, Social Security Numbers themselves do not have direct significance to the assassination. However, their presence in HSCA staff payroll records and the ARRB's decisions to postpone their release due to privacy concerns are significant. This highlights the challenges of balancing historical transparency with the protection of personal information in government records related to the investigation.",
