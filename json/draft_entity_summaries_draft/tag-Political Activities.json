Another report focuses on Charles [REDACTED]'s political activities, fundraising attempts, and associations with potentially problematic individuals in the Dallas and Fort Worth areas. Lastly, an HSCA interview summary reveals Charles Steele, Jr.'s admission to distributing pro-Cuba leaflets with Lee Harvey Oswald, suggesting a connection between Oswald and pro-Castro political activities.
