  "summary": "The documents mention Libya in the context of CIA activities and intelligence gathering. One document from 1970 refers to GSFEW/1 personnel in Libya and the expansion of the UHF radio system. The other three documents from 1998 summarize contacts with intelligence source FCSTANDARD/32 in Addis Ababa, where discussions included topics related to Sudan and Libya. These contacts suggest that Libya was an area of interest for CIA intelligence operations during these periods, possibly related to regional political dynamics or security concerns. The documents do not directly link Libya to the JFK assassination.",
