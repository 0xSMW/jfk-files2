  "summary": "Evalena S. Vidal is mentioned in three documents related to payments and debriefings of Edward G. Tichborn (referred to as Bivard or Edvard in some documents) following his trip to Cuba in 1960. The documents primarily concern financial transactions and Tichborn's observations about Fidel Castro and potential contacts. While Evalena S. Vidal's specific role is not explicitly stated, the documents suggest she may have been involved in processing or overseeing payments related to Tichborn's activities. The documents do not provide enough information to determine her direct involvement or significance in the JFK assassination context.",
