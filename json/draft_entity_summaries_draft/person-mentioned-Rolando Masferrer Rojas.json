  "summary": "Rolando Masferrer Rojas was a Cuban exile involved in activities against both Haiti and Cuba during the mid-1960s. The documents suggest that Masferrer was engaged in plots and operations, possibly with U.S. government backing, which led to internal discussions about the legal implications of indicting him. The documents also indicate a liaison between Masferrer and the FBI. The timeline of his involvement spans from at least 1964 to 1966. A notable pattern across the documents is the focus on his activities against foreign governments and the potential U.S. government involvement or awareness of these activities.",
