  "summary": "Juanita Reyes is identified as a character reference for Manuel Marti in documents dated November 1968. Investigative efforts were made to contact her to verify information about Marti. Initial attempts to locate her at a provided address were unsuccessful, with reports indicating she no longer resided there and had possibly returned to Puerto Rico. A physical check at an address in the Bronx, New York, also yielded negative results. Eventually, contact was made with Reyes, who stated that she did not know Manuel Marti. The documents suggest a focused effort to verify Marti's background through his listed references, with Reyes being one of them.",
