  "summary": "Anna Tarasoff was a CIA employee, specifically an Intelligence Clerk. In 1960, there were concerns about her father's planned visit to the Russian Embassy to obtain a visa, leading to discussions about potential security risks and a decision not to brief him on her CIA employment, providing her with an army cover instead. In 1963, she requested a leave without pay and reinstatement to accompany her husband to a new station. The documents suggest a focus on managing potential security risks related to her CIA affiliation and accommodating her personal circumstances while maintaining her employment.",
