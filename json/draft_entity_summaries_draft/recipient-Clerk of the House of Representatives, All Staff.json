  "summary": "The documents provided primarily concern the payroll records of staff members who worked for the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The Clerk of the House of Representatives, All Staff, functions as the recipient of these payroll authorizations and related documentation. The documents detail the employment of various individuals, including Lance W. Svendsen, Dawne C. Miller, Peter G. Beeson, Clarence J. Day, Margo E. Jackson, and Dan L. Hardway. The records include information such as salary, position titles, employment dates, and payroll certifications. A recurring theme is the postponement of Social Security number releases from these records by the Assassination Records Review Board to protect personal privacy. The documents span from 1977 to 1995, reflecting the period of HSCA's operation and subsequent review of its records.",
