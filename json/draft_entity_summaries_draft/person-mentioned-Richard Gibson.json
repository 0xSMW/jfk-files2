  "summary": "Richard Gibson is mentioned in several documents related to the JFK assassination investigation. He is identified as having had contact with Lee Harvey Oswald and the FPCC (Fair Play for Cuba Committee). A CIA message from 1964 reports on the magazine 'Revolution' in Paris denouncing Gibson, a former secretary of the FPCC, for allegedly infiltrating the international revolutionary movement. Later documents from 1998, related to the ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board), indicate that Gibson was a CIA asset, and his protection was a point of contention between the CIA and the ARRB during the release of JFK assassination-related records. The CIA sought to protect information related to Gibson, along with other sensitive equities such as covert actions, alias documentation, and the LITAMIL-9 operation.",
