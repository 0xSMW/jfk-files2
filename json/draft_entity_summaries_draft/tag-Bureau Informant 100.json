  "summary": "Bureau Informant 100 refers to a procedure established in 1954 by the FBI for handling information received from James Angleton of the CIA. This information was largely sourced from a liaison arrangement with the Israeli Intelligence Service. The FBI initially maintained a separate control file for this information, but later recommended discontinuing it as the data was already recorded in separate case files and deemed obsolete. The handling of information from \"Bureau Informant 100\" was considered sensitive, requiring specific methods such as forwarding the information by courier in sealed envelopes.",
