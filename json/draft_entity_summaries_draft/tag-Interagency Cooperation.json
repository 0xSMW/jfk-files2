  "summary": "Interagency cooperation, in the context of these documents, refers to the collaboration and information sharing between various U.S. government agencies, including intelligence and security organizations such as the CIA, FBI, Secret Service, Department of Defense, and Department of State. Its significance lies in ensuring effective Presidential protection and national security. The documents highlight the importance of this cooperation, particularly in the aftermath of the JFK assassination, as agencies reviewed their procedures and sought to improve coordination. The Warren Commission's investigation underscored the need for enhanced interagency communication and collaboration to prevent future security lapses. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) also examined interagency relationships in the context of counterintelligence programs, further emphasizing the importance of coordinated efforts among different agencies.",

  "significance": "In the JFK assassination context, interagency cooperation is significant because the Warren Commission emphasized the need for improved communication and coordination among agencies to enhance Presidential protection. The documents suggest that a lack of seamless cooperation may have been a contributing factor to security vulnerabilities. The subsequent inquiries and reviews aimed to strengthen these interagency relationships to prevent similar incidents in the future.",
