  "summary": "The JFK Assassination Records refer to a collection of documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which the CIA reviewed and processed for release under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. These records were subject to review by the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), which worked with the CIA to balance transparency with the protection of intelligence sources, methods, and ongoing operations. The documents reveal the CIA's concerns about releasing information that could compromise covert employees' identities, cover mechanisms, and sensitive operational details. The records also reflect discussions and negotiations between the CIA and the ARRB regarding redactions, the handling of cryptonyms and pseudonyms, and the pace of declassification. Issues such as access to U-2 project records, the Warrenton Records Center, CIA's use of State Cover, Nosenko NBR records, Cuban Revolutionary Council financial records, the Ramparts Damage Assessment Document, Book Cables Dissemination Lists, and files of CIA officials were specifically addressed.",
