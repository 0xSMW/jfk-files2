  "significance": "In the JFK assassination context, visas are significant because they relate to Lee Harvey Oswald's attempts to travel to the Soviet Union and Cuba, raising questions about his motives and potential connections to foreign powers. The documents also suggest that intelligence agencies were monitoring individuals' visa applications and movements, potentially including Oswald's, and were involved in creating false documentation for covert operations. The mention of Kostikov's contact with Oswald regarding a visa request is particularly relevant.",
