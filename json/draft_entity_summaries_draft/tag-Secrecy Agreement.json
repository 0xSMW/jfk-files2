  "summary": "Secrecy Agreements are formal contracts or understandings used by the CIA to ensure that individuals, including employees, agents, and contractors, protect classified information. These agreements are crucial for maintaining operational security and preventing unauthorized disclosure of sensitive intelligence. The documents reveal that secrecy agreements were used in various contexts, including commercial cover programs, agent employment and termination (e.g., WIROGUE), and security protocols for classified systems (e.g., BYEMAN). The agreements outline the responsibilities of individuals to safeguard classified information and the potential consequences of breaches. The CIA provided copies of these agreements to the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) and the John F. Kennedy Assassination Review Board, indicating their relevance to inquiries about the agency's activities.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, secrecy agreements are significant because they relate to the CIA's efforts to protect sensitive information and operations. The ARRB and the JFK Assassination Review Board requested information about these agreements as part of their investigations into the CIA's activities, suggesting a concern that the agreements might have been used to conceal information relevant to the assassination. The documents also highlight the CIA's concern about potential leaks of sensitive information related to the HSCA investigation.",
