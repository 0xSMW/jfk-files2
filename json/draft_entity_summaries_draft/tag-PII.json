The PII consists of data such as names, dates and places of birth, Social Security numbers, military service numbers, marital status, spouse's information, residences, children's information, and relatives' information. The presence of this information necessitates redaction or postponement of release to protect individual privacy, as seen in the case of Diana Jones' payroll records. The documents highlight the need to balance historical transparency with the protection of personal information within the JFK assassination records.",
