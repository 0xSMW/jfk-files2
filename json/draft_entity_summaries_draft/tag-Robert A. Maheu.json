He was recruited by the CIA in 1954 and became involved in covert operations. His activities included handling Jordanian public relations in the U.S. and involvement in sensitive assignments such as the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro and providing companionship to King Hussein. There was concern within the CIA about potential risks due to Senate Subcommittee interest in his activities. Later, he was investigated by International Intelligence, Inc. (INTERTEL) on behalf of the Hughes Tool Company.",
