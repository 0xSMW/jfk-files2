  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Brussels appears as a location where intelligence activities related to CIA operations and investigations were directed. The documents do not directly implicate Brussels in the JFK assassination. Instead, they highlight Brussels as a point of contact or location relevant to other investigations, specifically the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination investigation. The documents suggest that the CIA was seeking to balance cooperation with the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) with the need to protect intelligence sources and relationships in Brussels, particularly with an entity referred to as NIGALE. The documents indicate that the HSCA requested information on the Flemish Order of Militants (VMO) in connection with the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination investigation, and the CIA was considering how to respond to this request while preserving its relationship with NIGALE in Brussels.",
