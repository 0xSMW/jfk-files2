  "summary": "Llewellyn Thompson is mentioned in connection to Lee Harvey Oswald's return to the United States from the Soviet Union in 1962. The documents suggest that Thompson, along with Abram Chayes, was involved in facilitating Oswald's return. The documents primarily focus on Abram Chayes' role and security clearances, as well as Samuel Wise's potential CIA connections, in relation to Oswald's return. Thompson's specific actions or responsibilities are not detailed, but his name is linked to the overall event of Oswald's repatriation. The documents do not provide a timeline of Thompson's involvement beyond the general context of Oswald's return in 1962. The pattern across the documents is that Thompson's name appears alongside Chayes and Wise in discussions about Oswald's return and potential security implications.",
