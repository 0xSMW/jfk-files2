  "summary": "The documents indicate that Congress played a role in overseeing and being informed about CIA activities during the Cold War era. Following the failed Cuban operation, Congressional committees were briefed on the situation. Later, there were discussions regarding the authority of Congress, specifically the Senate Select Committee chaired by Senator Frank Church, to declassify and release classified information. The CIA also sought to improve its standing in Congress, indicating a need for Congressional support or approval for its operations. These documents suggest that Congress acted as an oversight body, receiving briefings and potentially influencing or scrutinizing CIA actions.",
