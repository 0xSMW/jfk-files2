  "summary": "The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) is mentioned in the documents primarily in connection to Hosea Williams, a leader within the organization. One document reports on Williams' claims made during a visit to Ethiopia, where he alleged JKLANCE's involvement in the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and possibly Malcolm X. The other two documents focus on Martin Luther King Jr.'s connections to Stanley Levison and alleged Communist ties, which were being investigated by the FBI and provided to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC).",

  "significance": "In the context of these documents, the SCLC's significance lies in its connection to Martin Luther King Jr. and the allegations made by one of its leaders, Hosea Williams, regarding the assassinations of prominent figures. The documents do not directly link the SCLC to the JFK assassination, but rather highlight its involvement in other significant historical events and investigations.",
