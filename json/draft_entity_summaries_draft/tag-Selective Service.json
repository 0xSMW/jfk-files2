  "significance": "In the context of these documents, the Selective Service serves as a means of identifying and tracking individuals who were then subjected to background checks and investigations. The significance lies in the fact that Selective Service registration was used as a starting point for gathering information on individuals, potentially linking them to broader investigations or areas of interest for law enforcement and military agencies during the 1960s. However, the documents do not explicitly state a connection to the JFK assassination.",
