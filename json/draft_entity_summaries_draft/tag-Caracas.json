  "summary": "Caracas appears in the documents primarily in the context of CIA stations and investigations related to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the assassination of Orlando Letelier. CIA cables instructed personnel in Caracas, along with those in Guayaquil and Quito, on how to interact with HSCA investigators, emphasizing the need to limit comments to their cover activities. One document mentions reporters traveling to Caracas to investigate potential connections between the Letelier assassination and Cuban exiles, Venezuelan secret police, the CIA, and Chilean secret police. Another document relays statements of Manolo Ray regarding Cuban exiles, though the connection to Caracas is not explicitly stated.",
