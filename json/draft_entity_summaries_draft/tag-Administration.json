  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the 'Administration' tag primarily relates to the administrative and personnel management aspects of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). These documents provide insights into the staffing, payroll, and operational procedures of the committee during its investigation. While not directly related to the assassination itself, they offer a glimpse into the inner workings of the HSCA and the resources allocated to the investigation. The documents related to Cuban affairs in the Department of Defense touch upon the broader geopolitical context of the time, but their direct relevance to the JFK assassination is less clear from these specific records.",
