Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The documents provided relate to the HSCA's operations, including staff payroll records, background checks, and investigations into CIA activities in Mexico City. These documents highlight the administrative aspects of the HSCA's work, as well as their investigative efforts into potential connections between the CIA and the JFK assassination. The timeline of involvement spans from 1976 to 1978, reflecting the period during which the HSCA was actively conducting its investigations. A notable pattern across the documents is the focus on personnel management and security, as well as the investigation into the CIA's role.",
