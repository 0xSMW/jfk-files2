  "summary": "Rivera is mentioned in the context of briefings on Cuban subversion in El Salvador. In 1964, stations in El Salvador and Guatemala were directed to arrange briefings for President Rivera on this topic. A later message from San Salvador expressed satisfaction with the briefing given to the President, but also concern over security breaches. The documents suggest that Rivera was the President of El Salvador in 1964 and was being briefed on Cuban subversion activities in the region. The third document does not mention Rivera directly, but is included in the document set.",

  "significance": "Rivera's significance in the JFK context is indirect. The documents suggest that the CIA was actively monitoring and briefing the President of El Salvador on Cuban subversion activities. This context is relevant to understanding the broader geopolitical landscape and the US government's concerns about Cuban influence in Latin America during the Cold War, which is a relevant backdrop to the JFK assassination.",
