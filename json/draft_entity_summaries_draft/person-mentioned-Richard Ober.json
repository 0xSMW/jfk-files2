  "significance": "While the documents primarily concern the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., one document mentions an 'Inventory of Rockefeller Commission Files' which details documents related to the CIA's activities and the Kennedy assassination. Richard Ober's name appears in this inventory, suggesting a potential, though not explicitly defined, connection to files related to the JFK assassination, as the Rockefeller Commission investigated CIA activities, including those potentially relevant to the JFK assassination. His role in disseminating information and coordinating efforts in the King assassination investigation highlights his position within the CIA and his potential access to sensitive information.",
