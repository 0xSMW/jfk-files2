Specific examples include the exfiltration of AMFAUMA-25 from Cuba due to threats, the debriefing of AMFAUNA-14 after detention, and the assessment of PBRUMEN exiles for potential intelligence collection. The documents also mention the transfer of QJWIN, the use of candidates spotted in Italy, and a handwritten list of 'ASSETS KNOWN' with code names and descriptions. The status of station contacts and assets is also monitored, with reasons for 'no contact' status provided.",
