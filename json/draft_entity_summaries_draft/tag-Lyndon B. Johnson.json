These documents span from 1962 to 1968, covering his time as Vice President and President. As Vice President, he was involved in discussions regarding US policy and actions related to Cuba, including anti-Castro activities. After becoming President, he was briefed on sensitive matters such as telephone surveillance operations in Mexico, the interrogation of Nosenko, and foreign policy issues related to Cuba, Vietnam, and Pakistan.
