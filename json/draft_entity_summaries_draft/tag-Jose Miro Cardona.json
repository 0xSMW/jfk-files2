  "summary": "Jose Miro Cardona was a significant figure in the Cuban exile community, particularly known for his involvement in anti-Castro activities. He appears in the documents primarily in the context of efforts to undermine or overthrow the Castro regime in Cuba during the early 1960s. One document mentions his potential resignation from the Cuban Revolutionary Council due to perceived changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba. Another document highlights his communication with Miguel Ydigoras-Fuentes, facilitated by Carlos Alejos, regarding anti-Fidel Castro activities. These communications suggest Cardona's active role in coordinating efforts against Castro with various actors, including those in Guatemalan government circles. Overall, the documents portray Cardona as a key player in the Cuban exile movement, deeply involved in political and potentially paramilitary actions aimed at destabilizing the Cuban government.",
