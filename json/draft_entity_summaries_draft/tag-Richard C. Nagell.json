  "summary": "Richard C. Nagell is connected to the case of Victor L. Trinkala, a soldier who attempted to separate from military service as a conscientious objector. Nagell appears to have intervened to prevent Trinkala's deployment to Vietnam. An agent report also details a local agency check regarding Post Office Box 2337, which is registered to Richard C. Nagell at 2292 Edythe Drive, Dundeon, Florida. The documents suggest an investigation into Nagell's activities and his potential involvement in assisting Trinkala's separation from the military, possibly due to Trinkala's status as a conscientious objector.",
