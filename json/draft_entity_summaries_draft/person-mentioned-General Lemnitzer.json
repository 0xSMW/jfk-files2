The documents span from May to November 1962, indicating a period of sustained engagement with these issues.

  "significance": "The significance of General Lemnitzer in the JFK context, based solely on these documents, is his involvement in Operation Mongoose and his participation in Special Group meetings concerning covert actions against Cuba. These activities are relevant to understanding the broader context of U.S.-Cuba relations and potential motivations for individuals or groups who may have opposed President Kennedy's policies. However, the documents do not establish a direct link between Lemnitzer and the assassination.",
