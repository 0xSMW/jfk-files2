  "summary": "Romulo Betancourt is mentioned in the documents in the context of Cuban support for subversive activities, particularly in Venezuela. While the documents do not provide extensive details about Betancourt himself, his significance lies in his position as a leader in Venezuela during a period when Cuba was actively supporting subversive activities in the region. The documents suggest that Cuban support for these activities was a concern for the CIA, and Betancourt's government was likely a target or affected by these actions. The documents do not provide a timeline of Betancourt's involvement or specific details about his role, but his position as a leader in Venezuela makes him relevant to understanding the broader context of Cuban influence and subversive efforts in Latin America during this period.",
