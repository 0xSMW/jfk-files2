Charles Seitz was a pilot being considered for Proprietary Approval by the DOD for Project WUBETON, unknowingly acting as a flight instructor for an Agency proprietary entity. Eduardo Whitehouse was a pilot involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion and later contracted by the CIA for the WITHRUSH Project. Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz is mentioned in connection with suspected operations from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and possible association with Fidel Castro, although his specific role as a pilot in this context is not detailed. The documents suggest a pattern of pilots being involved in covert operations and projects associated with the CIA during the Cold War era.",
