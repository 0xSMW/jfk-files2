  "summary": "MOC stands for Memorandum of Oral Commitment. The documents indicate that MOCs were used by the CIA to formalize agreements with individuals, often in the context of operational activities. These commitments covered terms of engagement, compensation, and operational responsibilities. One MOC was amended due to a salary raise, indicating the dynamic nature of these agreements. The documents highlight the use of MOCs in maritime operations and within the JMWAVE station, suggesting their importance in covert activities. The documents span from 1961 to 1965, indicating a period of active use of MOCs during the Cold War era.",

  "significance": "While the documents do not directly link MOCs to the JFK assassination, they reveal the CIA's operational practices and contractual arrangements with individuals involved in covert activities during the Cold War. The use of MOCs in maritime operations and within JMWAVE, a station known for its involvement in anti-Castro activities, suggests a potential connection to individuals or operations that may have indirectly related to the events surrounding the assassination. Further investigation into the specific individuals and operations mentioned in the MOCs could potentially uncover relevant information.",
