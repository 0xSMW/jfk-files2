  "summary": "Indexing, in the context of these documents, refers to the systematic organization and management of information, particularly related to individuals of interest and operational activities. It involves creating lists, categorizing information, and filing documents for easy retrieval. The 201 system, as described in one document, is a specific method used by the Operations Directorate to identify, control, and file information about individuals. Indexing is crucial for efficient information retrieval and analysis, enabling the agency to track individuals, relationships, and events effectively. The documents highlight the importance of indexing in managing sensitive information related to individuals and operations, including those connected to JMWAVE and potentially relevant to the JFK assassination context.",
