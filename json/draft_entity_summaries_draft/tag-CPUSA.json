  "significance": "In the JFK context, the CPUSA is significant due to alleged connections between individuals associated with Martin Luther King Jr. and the CPUSA, specifically Stanley Levison. The FBI's efforts to establish Levison's secret CPUSA membership and the Senate Select Committee's investigation into these ties suggest a concern about potential communist influence within the civil rights movement and its possible implications.",
