  "summary": "ELINT (Electronic Intelligence) refers to intelligence gathered from electronic signals and systems, such as radar. In the context of the provided documents, ELINT data was crucial in assessing the capabilities and effectiveness of the Soviet air defense system during the Cold War. The documents highlight missions penetrating the Soviet Bloc air defense system in June-July 1956, where ELINT data, combined with COMINT (Communications Intelligence), was used to analyze Soviet radar coverage, response strategies, and the overall effectiveness of their warning system. While not directly related to the JFK assassination in these documents, ELINT's role in gathering intelligence about potential adversaries is evident.",
