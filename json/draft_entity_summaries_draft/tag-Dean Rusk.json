He also participated in discussions regarding US policy towards Cuba, potential actions against the Castro regime, and concerns about unauthorized raids by Cuban exiles. Rusk's role appears to be primarily focused on diplomatic efforts and policy formulation related to containing communism and protecting US interests in the Western Hemisphere.",
