  "summary": "The Chief/Office of Covert Communications (OCC) within the CIA played a key role in managing the potential fallout from the public release of JFK assassination records. In the mid-1990s, specifically between 1995 and 1997, the OCC was responsible for contacting CIA stations worldwide (Paris, Bonn, Mexico City, Caracas, San Jose) to request assistance in informing former employees residing in those locations that their names appeared in the JFK Assassination Records. This was in compliance with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The OCC provided guidance to these former employees regarding the potential public release of their names and offered them the opportunity to argue against disclosure. A notable pattern across the documents is the repeated request for station assistance to contact former employees, indicating a systematic effort by the CIA, through the OCC, to address the implications of the JFK Act.",
