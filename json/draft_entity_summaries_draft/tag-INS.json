  "summary": "The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) appears in these documents primarily in the context of providing information or being requested to provide information on individuals of interest to the CIA. One document mentions a request from the INS to potentially use a covert Agency employee, Balmes Hidalgo Jr., as an informant. The documents suggest that the INS was a point of contact for the CIA when dealing with individuals entering or residing in the United States, or when information about an individual's immigration status or background was needed. The documents do not directly link the INS to the JFK assassination, but rather show its role as a government agency that could be involved in information gathering and potential recruitment of informants.",

  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, the INS's significance in the JFK context is not directly apparent. Its role seems to be more related to immigration matters and potential cooperation with the CIA on information gathering, rather than any direct involvement in events surrounding the assassination.",
