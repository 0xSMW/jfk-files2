  "summary": "NWBOLTON is an individual or entity of interest in the context of the JFK assassination, with documents suggesting potential involvement or association with individuals who suspected NWBOLTON of involvement in President Kennedy's assassination. There are concerns about the public disclosure of covert affiliations of former NWBOLTON employees due to the Assassination Records Review Board's document release. One document mentions a person claiming a former association with NWBOLTON, alleging sabotage of an article related to the assassination trail. There is also a reference to an anti-NWBOLTON propaganda effort by Cubans at a Rio <JFK> conference. The timeline spans from at least 1995 to 1996, based on the document dates. A pattern emerges of suspicion and investigation surrounding NWBOLTON's possible role in the JFK assassination, as well as efforts to manage information related to this connection.",
