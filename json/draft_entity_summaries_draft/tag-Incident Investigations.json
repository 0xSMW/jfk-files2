These investigations involve individuals like Joachim S. Beer, David Reed Fromer, Manuel Marti, Richard C. Nagell, Kenneth C. Griggs, and Joseph Timothy White. The investigations often involve verifying information, checking records, and gathering intelligence on these individuals. The timeline spans from the 1960s to the 1980s, with a concentration in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A notable pattern is the use of local agency checks and agent reports to gather information on individuals of interest, often involving name aliases and potential connections to organizations or activities deemed relevant to national security.",
