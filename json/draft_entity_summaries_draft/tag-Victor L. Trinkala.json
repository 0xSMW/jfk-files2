Nagell, who intervened to prevent Trinkala's deployment to Vietnam. An anonymous caller reported that Trinkala, identified as a Conscientious Objector, was allegedly contacted by a \"Soviet Agent\" and potentially could be used in anti-U.S. propaganda. Later investigations involved local agency checks related to Nagell's address and an interview with Harfez Muneer regarding Nagell's role in Trinkala's separation from military service as a conscientious objector.",
