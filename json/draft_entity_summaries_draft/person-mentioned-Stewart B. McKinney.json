  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Stewart B. McKinney is mentioned within the context of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) staff payroll records and related documentation. While the documents themselves do not explicitly detail McKinney's role or involvement, his name appears in association with the committee's personnel and payroll information. The documents primarily focus on the Assassination Records Review Board's (ARRB) decisions regarding the release of HSCA staff payroll records, particularly concerning the postponement of Social Security numbers to protect personal privacy. Therefore, McKinney's connection is inferred through his association with the HSCA, though the specific nature of his role or contribution is not elaborated upon within these documents.",
