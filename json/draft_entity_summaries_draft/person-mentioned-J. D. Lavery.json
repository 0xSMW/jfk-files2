  "summary": "J. D. Lavery is mentioned in three documents, all dated April 7, 1977, related to the classification of a document labeled EX 3600. The documents are memoranda concerning the justification for classifying EX 3600, citing its connection to Operation MHCHAOS, the inclusion of information from sensitive sources and classified FBI reports, and suggesting a FOIA exemption. Lavery appears to be a recipient of these memoranda, indicating a role within the Office of General Counsel (OGC) where classification decisions were being reviewed or communicated.",

  "significance": "J. D. Lavery's significance in the JFK context, based on these documents, lies in their involvement in decisions regarding the classification of documents potentially related to Operation MHCHAOS. The documents suggest Lavery was part of a process to determine whether certain information should remain classified, possibly to protect sensitive sources, methods, or ongoing investigations. The classification of EX 3600 is the central issue, and Lavery's role appears to be as a recipient of information and potentially a decision-maker in the classification process.",
