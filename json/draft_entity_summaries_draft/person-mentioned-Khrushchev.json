  "significance": "Khrushchev's significance in the JFK assassination context is indirect. While the documents do not directly link him to the assassination, they highlight the intense Cold War environment and the US government's concerns about Soviet influence, particularly in Cuba. The documents suggest that the US government was closely monitoring Soviet activities and intentions, including Khrushchev's, due to the potential threat they posed to US national security. The context of the Cold War and the Cuban Missile Crisis may have contributed to the overall political climate in which the assassination occurred.",
