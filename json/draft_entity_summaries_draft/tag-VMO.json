  "summary": "The Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO), or Flemish Order of Militants, is a Flemish militant organization that garnered the attention of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) during its investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. The HSCA requested information on the VMO, specifically regarding potential contacts between VMO members and American citizens between 1968 and 1970. However, NIGALE, an intelligence source, and NITRUST, a liaison contact, were reluctant to share information with the HSCA due to concerns about potential leaks and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The documents indicate a reluctance to provide reports or information on the VMO to the House of Representatives committee, citing a lack of information on VMO-American citizen contacts during the specified period.",

  "significance": "While the documents explicitly connect the VMO to the investigation into the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., the documents were found within the JFK collection. The significance of the VMO in the JFK context is not directly stated in these documents, but the HSCA's interest in the group suggests a potential, though unconfirmed, link or area of inquiry related to assassinations.",
