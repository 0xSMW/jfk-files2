  "summary": "Finland appears in the documents primarily in the context of Lee Harvey Oswald's stay in Helsinki in October 1959. The CIA investigated Oswald's contact with the Soviet Consulate during this period, prompted by the Warren Commission's inquiry. Finland also appears in a world brief summarizing global political and military situations in December 1963. Additionally, the country is mentioned in connection with Soviet personnel, specifically Mikhail Vasilyevich KURACHOV and Petr Nikitovich SAVALYEV, operating in Finland and Norway, potentially involved in intelligence operations. The documents suggest that Finland was a location of interest due to its proximity to the Soviet Union and its role in Cold War activities.",
