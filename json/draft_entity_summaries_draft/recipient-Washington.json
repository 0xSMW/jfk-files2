  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, \"Washington\" appears to refer to the U.S. government, specifically elements within the intelligence community and potentially the House of Representatives. The documents highlight instances where information is being withheld from or shared with entities in Washington. One document mentions interest in monitoring congressional reactions to Oltmans' visit. The documents also reveal reluctance to share information with the House Committee on Assassinations regarding potential contacts between the Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO) and American citizens, citing concerns about information leaks and the Freedom of Information Act. This suggests a concern within certain agencies about transparency and potential scrutiny from Washington regarding sensitive information related to foreign contacts and activities.",

  "significance": "Washington's significance in the JFK context, as suggested by these documents, lies in its role as an oversight body (e.g., the House Committee on Assassinations) seeking information, and as a recipient of intelligence reports. The reluctance of certain agencies to share information with Washington, particularly the House Committee, raises questions about transparency and potential efforts to conceal information relevant to investigations, including those related to the JFK assassination.",
