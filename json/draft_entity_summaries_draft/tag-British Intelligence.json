  "summary": "British Intelligence, specifically MI-6, plays a role in these documents primarily through information gathering and sharing with US intelligence agencies like the CIA and FBI. Their involvement spans from 1960 to 1964, with a focus on relaying intercepted communications and providing leads on individuals of interest. They are depicted as a source of information regarding potential security risks, such as individuals possibly connected to the KGB or those traveling to Cuba without authorization. A notable pattern is their function as an intermediary, passing on information obtained from other sources, like the Cuban Embassy in London or British newspapermen, to US agencies for further investigation.",
