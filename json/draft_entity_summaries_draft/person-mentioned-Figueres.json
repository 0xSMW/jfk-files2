  "summary": "Jose Figueres Ferrer was a prominent political figure, specifically the ex-President of Costa Rica. In the context of the provided documents, Figueres is mentioned in a 1963 memo outlining a plan to influence him and Foreign Minister Uduber to promote AMWORLD and AMBIDDY-1. The plan involved using CIA contract personnel, Cuban exile organizations, and support from Latin American leaders like Betancourt. While the documents do not directly link Figueres to the JFK assassination, they suggest that he was a target of influence operations by the CIA, potentially involving Cuban exiles. The other documents do not mention Figueres directly, but provide context about CIA operations in Latin America during the same period.",
