  "significance": "The Office of Personnel's significance in the JFK context is indirect. The documents primarily illustrate the office's role in managing CIA personnel, some of whom may have been involved in events related to the JFK assassination. The documents themselves do not directly implicate the Office of Personnel in any specific activities related to the assassination, but they provide insight into the management and movement of CIA personnel during the relevant time period.",
