  "summary": "Minsk, as a location, is significant primarily due to Lee Harvey Oswald's residence there in the Soviet Union. The documents reveal that the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) were interested in accessing records held by the BKGB (Belarusian KGB) in Minsk related to Oswald's time there. The CIA station in Minsk was involved in facilitating meetings between the ARRB and BKGB, though CIA participation in substantive discussions was explicitly forbidden. There were concerns about the security of the US Embassy in Minsk and the potential unauthorized access to Oswald's files by researchers, such as Norman Mailer. The documents also mention general operational support and embassy-related activities in Minsk, as well as information on Soviet life and KGB operations in the city.",
