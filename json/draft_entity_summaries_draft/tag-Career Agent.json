  "summary": "The documents refer to 'Career Agents' within the context of CIA operations. These individuals, such as R. L. Crozier, Arthur G. VAIVADA, and Irving C. DEVUONO, were involved in assignments requiring specific security considerations, non-official cover, and potentially irregular working hours. R.L. Crozier's assignment to Isolation was not approved due to his non-staff status and security considerations related to his assignment in Mexico. Arthur G. VAIVADA agreed to become a career agent, with plans to obtain U.S. citizenship for his wife to enhance his security in non-official cover assignments. Irving C. DEVUONO, assigned to JMWAVE and JBAR, qualified for premium pay due to the demands of his PCS assignment. The documents highlight the operational roles and administrative aspects associated with career agents during this period.",
