  "summary": "President Lyndon B. Johnson is mentioned in several documents related to the JFK assassination and associated investigations. His name appears in the context of the Warren Commission, with concerns about documents prejudicial to him being offered for sale. A CIA report indicates Fidel Castro was avoiding irritating President Johnson after Kennedy's assassination, hoping for improved relations. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) requested CIA documents related to the JFK assassination, including interactions with the Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) Library. Documents also discuss the release of JFK assassination-related documents, with concerns about protecting identities of informants and Soviet agents. Overall, President Johnson's role is primarily as the successor to President Kennedy, with implications for US-Cuban relations and the handling of the Warren Commission report and subsequent investigations into the assassination.",
