  "summary": "Ngo Dinh Can is mentioned in three documents. The documents do not provide direct information about Ngo Dinh Can himself, but rather discuss political and military situations in South Vietnam during the early 1960s. One document discusses opposition in Khanh Hoa Province, while the other two detail political instability and coup plotting against President Ngo Dinh Diem's regime. While Ngo Dinh Can is not the central focus, the documents suggest he was a figure of importance within the context of South Vietnamese politics during this period, given his association with the Diem regime.",
