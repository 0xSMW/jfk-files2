  "summary": "The Legislative Liaison, specifically the CIA's Office of Legislative Counsel, plays a crucial role in managing the CIA's interactions with the U.S. Congress. This involves handling information requests from congressional offices, arranging logistical support for intelligence-related events, and engaging with various House and Senate committees on matters such as hearings, budget briefings, and sensitive investigations. The documents highlight the office's activities during the late 1970s, particularly concerning the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigation into the Kennedy assassination. The office was concerned about potential exposure of sensitive CIA operations and inquiries related to former Agency employees during this period. The role involves navigating the complex relationship between the intelligence community and the legislative branch, ensuring that congressional oversight is balanced with the need to protect classified information and ongoing operations.",
