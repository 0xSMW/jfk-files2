  "summary": "The United Nations (UN) is an international organization mentioned in the documents in the context of various global issues. One document references the UN's handling of the Cuban situation, as perceived by Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa. Another document discusses the planned withdrawal of UN troops from the Congo in 1963, despite the Congolese Premier's desire to maintain a presence. The documents do not directly connect the UN to the JFK assassination, but rather highlight its role in international affairs during the early 1960s.",

The UN's role in Cuba and the Congo are mentioned.",
