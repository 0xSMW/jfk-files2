  "summary": "The Garrison Investigation refers to the inquiry led by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The investigation sought to uncover a conspiracy behind the assassination, diverging from the official Warren Commission report.

The documents cover a period primarily from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, indicating sustained interest and concern within the CIA regarding the potential impact of Garrison's findings. The documents also reveal the CIA's attempts to manage and mitigate the fallout from Garrison's investigation, particularly in relation to individuals who claimed connections to the Agency or were otherwise linked to the assassination narrative.",
