  "summary": "AMBUD-1 was involved in operations coordinated by JMWAVE. The documents suggest AMBUD-1 was involved in coordinating exile groups, gathering intelligence, and establishing contact with fishermen. There were arrangements made for AMBUD-1's visit to PACY (Panama City), including meetings with political figures, and the financing of the operation for propaganda purposes. Concerns were raised regarding AMBUD-1's interest in how copies of letters from Jose Ignacio Rasco and Dr. Rafael Aguirre were obtained, and the potential risk to AMULLA-1. JMWAVE planned to implement SECRET NOFORN controls on materials from AMULLA-1 to protect their future and the source itself.",
