  "summary": "LITAMIL-9 was a CIA penetration of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. They provided information regarding Cuban Embassy personnel, potential security breaches, and diplomatic activities, including planned actions against a Mexican national. The ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board) considered the protection of LITAMIL-9 as a pending issue in their negotiations with the CIA regarding the release of JFK assassination-related records. This protection was deemed necessary to safeguard sensitive Agency equities and operational details. The documents suggest LITAMIL-9's information was relevant to CIA activities in Mexico City in 1963, a period of interest due to Lee Harvey Oswald's presence there.",
