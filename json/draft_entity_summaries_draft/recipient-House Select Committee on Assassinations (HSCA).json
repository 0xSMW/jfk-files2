  "summary": "The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) was a committee formed to investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The CIA provided materials to the HSCA for review at CIA headquarters. The HSCA investigated allegations of CIA involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald, including claims that Oswald was a CIA agent stationed in Tokyo and that the CIA routinely debriefed returning American defectors from the Soviet Union. The CIA consistently denied any contact with Oswald. The HSCA investigation spanned from September 1976 to June 1978, involving meetings, requests for information, and correspondence between the HSCA and the CIA.",

  "significance": "The HSCA played a crucial role in investigating potential connections between the CIA and Lee Harvey Oswald, as well as examining the possibility of a broader conspiracy in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Their investigation sought to determine if the CIA had any prior contact with Oswald or if the agency had a pattern of debriefing American defectors returning from the Soviet Union, which could have implicated them in the assassination.",
