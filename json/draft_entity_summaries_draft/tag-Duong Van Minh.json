  "summary": "Duong Van Minh, a Major General in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), is a central figure in discussions surrounding a potential coup d'Ã©tat against President Ngo Dinh Diem. The documents indicate Minh's involvement in planning such a coup, with reports detailing his criticisms of Diem's leadership, particularly regarding the handling of the Buddhist issue and perceived loss of popular support. He is mentioned as a key participant in coup plans slated for September 1963, involving other generals like Tran Thien Khiem, Nguyen Khanh, and Le Van Kim. The documents suggest that Minh was advocating for a change in government, though he opposed Ngo Dinh Nhu's succession. The timeline of his involvement spans from at least August 1962, with warnings of a possible coup, to September 1963, when concrete plans were being formulated.",
