  "summary": "Declassification, in the context of these documents, refers to the process of reviewing and releasing classified information, particularly related to the JFK assassination records. This process was significantly influenced by the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which mandated the release of assassination-related documents to the public. The CIA, along with other government agencies, was heavily involved in this process, navigating the balance between transparency and the protection of sensitive information, including the identities of human sources, ongoing intelligence operations, and foreign government liaison relationships. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) played a crucial role in overseeing the declassification process, often engaging in discussions and negotiations with the CIA regarding the scope and extent of document releases. Concerns were raised about potential damage to national security, foreign relations, and the safety of individuals if certain information was disclosed. The declassification efforts spanned from the 1960s, with reviews of Warren Commission documents, through the 1990s, driven by the JFK Act, and involved numerous internal reviews, consultations with foreign intelligence agencies (like ASIO), and interactions with congressional committees.",
