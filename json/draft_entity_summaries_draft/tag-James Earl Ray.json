  "summary": "James Earl Ray is identified as the accused assassin in the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination. The documents detail efforts to identify and track him, including requests for identikit composites, fingerprint formulas, and information on his aliases and whereabouts. The CIA, at the request of the FBI, gathered information on Ray through overseas liaison services. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigated potential leads related to Ray in Portugal, the UK, and Mexico. The documents span from 1968, immediately following the assassination, to 1977, during the HSCA investigation, with a supplementary memo in 1975. A notable pattern is the focus on identifying Ray through physical characteristics and fingerprints, as well as the international scope of the investigation.",
