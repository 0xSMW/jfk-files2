  "summary": "Daniel Flores was a CIA employee. The documents indicate his employment with the CIA from at least 1962 to 1975. He swore an oath to support the Constitution and affirmed his loyalty and truthfulness in 1962. In 1974, he provided a Supplemental Personal History Statement detailing personal information. In 1975, the CIA's General Counsel requested he be excused from jury duty, citing a special category of employees, and emphasizing the need for confidentiality regarding his jury summons and the General Counsel's letter. He is also mentioned in a memo regarding the transfer of AMMUG to a new apartment, though his specific role in that event is not detailed.",

  "significance": "The significance of Daniel Flores in the JFK assassination context is not explicitly stated in these documents. However, his employment with the CIA during the relevant period and the agency's concern for confidentiality regarding his jury duty suggest a potential, though unspecified, connection to CIA activities during that time. Further investigation would be needed to determine any direct relevance to the JFK assassination.",
