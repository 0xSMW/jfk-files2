  "summary": "The documents tagged as 'CIA Liaison Material' primarily involve information sharing between the FBI and the CIA. The memos detail instances where the FBI provides information to the CIA regarding various activities and individuals. These include a Soviet office ordering safes for the Soviet Embassy in Havana, Cuba, and the CIA's use of an informant, Petros Moutsos, who is planned to travel to Cuba. The documents suggest a collaborative relationship between the two agencies, with the FBI acting as an information source for the CIA. The significance in the JFK context is not explicitly stated in these documents, but the information sharing could be relevant to understanding the broader intelligence landscape and activities related to Cuba during this period.",
