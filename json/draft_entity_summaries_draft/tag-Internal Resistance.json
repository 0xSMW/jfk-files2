  "summary": "The concept of \"Internal Resistance\" in the provided documents primarily refers to efforts within Cuba to oppose and potentially overthrow the Castro regime through actions originating from within the country, rather than external invasions. Manolo Ray, an exile leader of the People's Revolutionary Movement (MRP), consistently advocated for internal resistance, emphasizing the need for funds, trained exiles, and a broad base of support within Cuba. He opposed a U.S. invasion, believing that internal efforts were a more effective approach. The Cuba Project progress report also alludes to monitoring internal conditions within Cuba. The documents suggest that internal resistance was considered a viable alternative or complement to external actions against Castro, with varying strategies among different exile groups regarding actions against the Castro regime.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the concept of \"Internal Resistance\" is significant as it represents one of the strategies considered and supported by various factions, including Cuban exiles and potentially elements within the U.S. intelligence community, for dealing with the Castro regime. While the documents do not directly link internal resistance to the JFK assassination, the broader context of anti-Castro activities and the involvement of various groups in these activities is relevant to understanding the political climate and potential motivations surrounding the assassination.",
