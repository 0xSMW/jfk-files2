  "summary": "Tran Kim Tuyen was a significant figure in South Vietnam during the Diem regime. In mid-September 1962, he proposed a joint South Vietnamese and Nationalist Chinese intelligence operation in Laos. By mid-March 1963, oppositionists sought American support for overthrowing the Diem regime. In July 1963, Tuyen's group was planning a coup against President Diem and the Ngo Dinh Nhu brothers, expected shortly after July 20, 1963, citing Viet Cong activity as a factor. The documents suggest Tuyen was involved in plotting against the Diem regime and exploring intelligence operations in the region.",
