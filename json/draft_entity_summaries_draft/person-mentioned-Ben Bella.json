  "summary": "Ahmed Ben Bella was the first President of Algeria after its independence. The documents mention him in the context of Fidel Castro's planned visit to Algiers in April 1963, where Castro intended to meet with Ben Bella and Boumedienne. This meeting was part of Castro's effort to assert Cuba's independence from the Soviet Union, despite needing their assistance. Ben Bella's role appears to be primarily as a significant figure in the Non-Aligned Movement and a leader of a newly independent nation that Castro sought to engage with. The documents do not suggest any direct involvement of Ben Bella in the JFK assassination context.",
