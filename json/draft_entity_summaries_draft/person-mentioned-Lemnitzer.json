  "summary": "The documents mention Lemnitzer in the context of Operation MONGOOSE and related activities. While the specific role of Lemnitzer is not explicitly detailed in these summaries, the documents suggest involvement in discussions and planning related to actions against Cuba and Fidel Castro. The index cards reference meetings of the Special Group Augmented, which likely included Lemnitzer, and cover topics such as reconnaissance of Cuba, potential actions against Castro, sabotage, and psychological operations. The timeline of involvement spans from 1959 to 1963, based on the dates of the meeting minutes and memoranda referenced in the index cards. The documents do not provide enough information to determine Lemnitzer's direct involvement in the JFK assassination, but his association with Operation MONGOOSE, a covert operation targeting the Cuban government, places him within the broader context of US-Cuban relations during that period.",
