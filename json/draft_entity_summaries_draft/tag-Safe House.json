  "summary": "The documents refer to safe houses used by the CIA for various purposes. One document mentions SR safe houses being used for training and assessment of REDSKIN agent candidates outside of Washington, D.C. Another document describes the handling of a Soviet defector and family, implying the use of safe houses for temporary accommodation or secure transit. The third document does not explicitly mention safe houses but details a meeting between individuals discussing various operations and contacts, which could potentially involve the use of safe houses for clandestine activities. The documents suggest that safe houses were a standard operational tool for the CIA during this period, used for training, sheltering defectors, and potentially facilitating covert meetings and operations.",

  "significance": "The significance of safe houses in the JFK context is indirect. They represent a component of CIA infrastructure and operational methodology during the period leading up to the assassination. While these documents do not directly link safe houses to the JFK assassination, they illustrate the CIA's capacity for clandestine operations and the resources at its disposal, which is relevant when considering potential agency involvement or knowledge related to the event.",
