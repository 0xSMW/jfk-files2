The documents suggest the CIA may have had relationships with journalists, possibly as sources of information or assets. The ARRB's interest in these relationships indicates a concern that journalists may have been involved in or aware of events related to the assassination, or that the CIA may have used journalists for propaganda or disinformation purposes.",
