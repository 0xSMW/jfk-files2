The documents available primarily relate to his employment records, including payroll authorizations, leave records, internal memoranda, and payroll certifications. These records span from 1977 to 1978, indicating his period of employment with the HSCA. A 1995 Final Determination Notification from the Assassination Records Review Board addresses the release of his HSCA staff payroll records, with his Social Security number postponed from release due to privacy concerns. The documents do not provide specific details about his role within the HSCA or his direct involvement in the JFK assassination investigation, but rather focus on the administrative aspects of his employment.",
