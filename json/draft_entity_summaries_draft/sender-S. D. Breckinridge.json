  "summary": "S. D. Breckinridge is identified as the sender of a memorandum dated September 22, 1978, addressed to Ray Reardon. In this memo, Breckinridge requests photographs of Agency employees with the surname Bishop who were employed in the 1960s. The purpose of this request was to aid witnesses in identifying a person named Morris Bishop. While the documents do not explicitly state Breckinridge's role or position, the memo suggests an investigative or administrative function within the Agency, possibly related to identifying individuals based on witness testimony. The other documents in the set do not mention Breckinridge directly, but they provide context about the CIA's interactions with the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the handling of information related to the JFK assassination.",

The memo indicates involvement in an investigation that may have been related to identifying individuals connected to the assassination, although the specific connection to the JFK assassination is not explicitly stated in the available documents. The request for photographs of Agency employees with the surname Bishop suggests an effort to identify potential witnesses or persons of interest related to the case.",
