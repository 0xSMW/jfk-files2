  "summary": "Martin Luther King, Jr. is mentioned in these documents primarily in the context of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigation into his death. Several documents relate to the HSCA's requests for information regarding potential connections between King's assassination and other groups or individuals, such as the Flemish Order of Militants (VMO). One document details the dissemination of information about Eric Starvo Galt, a suspect in King's assassination. Additionally, some documents discuss investigations into King's alleged Communist ties and connections with individuals like Stanley Levison, reflecting broader surveillance and intelligence activities during that era. The documents highlight the FBI's and CIA's involvement in gathering and disseminating information related to King, both before and after his assassination.",

  "significance": "While not directly related to the JFK assassination, the documents reveal that the investigation into Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination was of interest to the same committees and agencies investigating the JFK assassination. The documents highlight the broader context of political assassinations and related investigations during the 1960s and 1970s, and the potential for overlapping investigations or shared intelligence resources.",
