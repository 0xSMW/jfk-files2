While not directly involved in the investigative work, the administrative function of managing staff payroll is essential for the operation of the HSCA. The payroll records themselves provide a verifiable account of who worked for the committee, their roles, and the duration of their service, offering a glimpse into the organizational structure and staffing of the HSCA during its investigation.",
