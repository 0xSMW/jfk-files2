  "summary": "The documents refer to the 'Flemish Order of Militants' (also known as Vlaamse Militanten Orde or VMO), a Flemish militant order. In 1978, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) requested information on the VMO as part of its investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. The CIA was tasked with responding to this request while also preserving its relationship with an intelligence source referred to as 'NIGALE'. NITRUST, a liaison contact, was reluctant to share information on potential VMO-American contacts with the HSCA due to concerns about information leaks and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The documents suggest a concern within the intelligence community about sharing information on the VMO with the HSCA, possibly due to the sensitivity of the source or the nature of the information itself.",
