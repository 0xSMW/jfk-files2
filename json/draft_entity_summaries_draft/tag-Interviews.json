The interviews cover a range of topics, including CIA cover procedures, personnel information, security measures, and potential connections to the assassination. The timeline spans from the early 1960s through the late 1970s, with some documents referencing materials from the 1990s. A notable pattern is the HSCA's extensive efforts to gather information through interviews, particularly concerning CIA activities and personnel.",
