  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, Luis Posada Carriles's significance in the JFK context is not directly mentioned. However, his documented history with the CIA, involvement in anti-Castro activities, and alleged connections to terrorist plots could potentially link him to broader narratives surrounding the JFK assassination, particularly concerning Cuban exile groups and CIA operations. Further research would be needed to establish any direct connection.",
