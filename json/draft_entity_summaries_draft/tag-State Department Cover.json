  "summary": "State Department cover refers to the practice of CIA personnel operating under the guise of being State Department employees. This cover was used to maintain operational utility and personal security, as revealed in a 1997 letter from the CIA's Executive Director urging the Assassination Records Review Board to reconsider releasing documents that would expose this practice. The documents show the CIA used State Department cover for various purposes, including providing cover for interpreters, such as Boris Tarasoff in 1962, who was selected as an interpreter for a Soviet Delegation. The use of State Department cover was considered important enough that the CIA General Counsel would request special handling to maintain confidentiality, as seen in the case of Daniel Flores in 1975, a CIA employee excused from jury duty.",

  "significance": "The use of State Department cover by the CIA is significant in the JFK assassination context because it raises questions about the transparency and accountability of government agencies. The CIA's desire to keep this practice secret, as evidenced by the letter to the Assassination Records Review Board, suggests that it may have been used in operations related to the assassination or its investigation. The documents highlight the CIA's concern about revealing its methods and the potential impact on operational utility and personal security.",
