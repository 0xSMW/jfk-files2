These plans included propaganda efforts, underground activities, and a potential commando raid. Cardona also requested U.S. support in the form of arms and proposed the establishment of a government on Cuban soil by the Revolutionary Council, with U.S. military assistance. The documents consistently highlight Cardona's proactive role in seeking U.S. support for these anti-Castro operations.",
