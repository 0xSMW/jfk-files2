  "significance": "The significance of arms sales in the JFK context lies in the potential connections between individuals involved in these activities and broader plots or conspiracies related to the assassination. The documents suggest that individuals involved in arms sales had connections to anti-Castro Cuban exiles, individuals with alleged CIA ties, and even Soviet representatives. These connections raise questions about whether arms sales were part of a larger network of covert operations or illicit activities that could have played a role in the events surrounding the assassination.",
