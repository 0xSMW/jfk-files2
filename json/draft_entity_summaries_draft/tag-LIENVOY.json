  "summary": "LIENVOY was a CIA project involving surveillance operations against Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City. These operations included telephone intercepts and monitoring of contacts made by individuals, including Lee Harvey Oswald, before the assassination of President Kennedy. The project ran from at least January 1962 to December 1963 and involved the processing and exploitation of intelligence gathered from these surveillance activities. Documents indicate that LIENVOY was connected to other projects like LIFEAT and KDBADGER, and there were concerns about the reliability and security of sources involved. The Mexico City Station's operational activities, including those related to LIENVOY, faced administrative and personnel challenges.",
