  "summary": "The Department of Defense (DoD) played a role in U.S. efforts to counter Cuban subversion in Latin America during the early 1960s. The DoD's activities included controlling travel to and from Cuba, clandestine movement of guerrillas and arms, transfer of funds, and strengthening counterinsurgency capabilities. These actions were coordinated with other agencies such as the Department of State, the CIA, and the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) through the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban Affairs (ICCA). The DoD's involvement spanned from at least April 1963 to January 1964, as documented in various reports. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) also made inquiries to the Department of Defense regarding U.S. counterintelligence and security programs.",

The DoD's activities and relationships with other agencies involved in these efforts may be relevant to understanding the context in which the assassination occurred.",
