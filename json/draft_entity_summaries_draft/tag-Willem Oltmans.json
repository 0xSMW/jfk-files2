  "summary": "Willem Oltmans was a person of interest due to his contacts with Cuban and Soviet diplomats. Cables from 1977 report on his meetings and contacts with these diplomats, his travel to the USSR and Cuba, and his past association with George de Mohrenschildt. The cables suggest conveying this information to Congressional authorities due to Oltmans' connection to de Mohrenschildt and the interest of congressional committees. The documents consistently highlight Oltmans' interactions with Cuban and Soviet officials and his link to de Mohrenschildt as reasons for concern and potential relevance to ongoing investigations.",
