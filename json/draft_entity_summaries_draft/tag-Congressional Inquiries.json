  "significance": "While the documents do not directly relate to the JFK assassination, they are significant in the broader context of government oversight and accountability. The inquiries into the CIA's budget and potential involvement in Watergate, along with the scrutiny of the FBI's COINTELPRO activities, reflect a period of increased congressional oversight of intelligence agencies. These inquiries could indirectly relate to the JFK assassination if they uncovered information about intelligence agency activities that were relevant to the assassination or its investigation, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided documents.",
