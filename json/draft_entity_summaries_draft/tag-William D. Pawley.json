  "summary": "William D. Pawley was involved in discussions regarding potential sabotage against Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba. Documents detail tape-recorded conversations between Pawley and an unidentified Cuban in October 1959, where they discussed anti-Castro plans and the possibility of U.S. support. Pawley expressed skepticism about the feasibility of supporting Cuban revolutionary activities due to disunity among anti-Castro groups and Castro's control. Additionally, Pawley had business interests in the Dominican Republic, including mineral exploitation and a postage stamp concession managed by his brother, Edward F. Pawley, as reported in June 1958.",
