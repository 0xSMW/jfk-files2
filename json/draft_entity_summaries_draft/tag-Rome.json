  "summary": "Rome appears in several CIA documents spanning from 1952 to 1973, indicating its use as a location for various agency activities. These activities include surveillance, agent contact, and potential operational support. Specifically, Rome is mentioned as a location for monitoring Luis Clemente Posada Carriles' suspected narcotics trafficking in 1973. In 1963, there was a plan to use AMWHIP/1, a CIA asset with ties to the Perumen regime, to support operations in Rome, providing cover and access to Perumen officials. Additionally, in 1952, Rome was one of the cities where Communist officials were monitored during William Z. Foster's trip. The documents suggest Rome was a location of interest for CIA activities, including surveillance, potential operational support, and monitoring of individuals and groups.",
