  "summary": "Manolo Ray was an exile leader of the People's Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo - MRP). He opposed a U.S. invasion of Cuba, advocating instead for internal resistance supported by a broad base within Cuba. He believed that funds and trained exiles were more crucial than a direct invasion to overthrow Castro. His statements were relayed by the British Service to the CIA. He was a key figure in Cuban exile circles during the early 1960s, and his views on how to deal with the Castro regime were considered important enough to be reported to the highest levels of the CIA.",

His opposition to a U.S. invasion and preference for internal resistance reflect the diverse opinions and strategies within the exile community, which are relevant to understanding the complex dynamics of the time.",
