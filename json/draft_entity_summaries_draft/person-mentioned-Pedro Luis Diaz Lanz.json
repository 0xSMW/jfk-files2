  "summary": "Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz was a person of interest to the FBI in the late 1950s and early 1960s. FBI documents from 1958 indicate that Diaz Lanz, along with Reinaldo Blanco Hernandez and Alberto Eusebio Mojena, were suspected of operating from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and possibly associated with Fidel Castro. These suspicions were based on information received from a CIA source. By 1960, Diaz Lanz's activities were mentioned in an FBI intelligence summary from Mexico, suggesting continued interest in his activities related to Cuban exile groups. The documents suggest the FBI was monitoring Diaz Lanz's activities and potential connections to Cuban political dynamics.",
