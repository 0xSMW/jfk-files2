  "summary": "The documents refer to \"Backstop\" as a system of cover, specifically \"Military Cover Backstop\" or \"Official Cover Backstop,\" used to protect the identities and activities of individuals or groups, such as the U.S. Army Joint Operations Group. The establishment and cancellation of these backstops are formally documented through notifications, which outline procedures for managing records, blocking information, and handling changes or transfers related to the cover. These procedures involve specific forms and actions by divisions like the Personnel Operations Division. The notifications span from 1961 to 1975, indicating a period of active use of these cover mechanisms. A notable pattern is the formal and procedural nature of establishing, maintaining, and canceling these cover backstops, emphasizing the importance of record management and control.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the concept of a \"Backstop\" is significant as it relates to potential efforts to conceal the identities and activities of individuals or groups who may have been involved in events surrounding the assassination. The documents suggest a formal system for creating and managing cover identities, which could have been used to obscure the roles of individuals or organizations involved in sensitive operations. The establishment and cancellation of these backstops, as well as the associated record management procedures, could be relevant to understanding potential efforts to control information related to the assassination.",
