King's involvement in CIA operations, particularly those related to Cuba and covert actions, places him within the broader context of individuals and activities scrutinized during investigations into the assassination. His role in the Western Hemisphere Division and potential knowledge of covert operations could be relevant to understanding the political climate and potential motives surrounding the assassination.",
