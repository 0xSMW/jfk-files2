The purpose is to ensure that individuals are aware of their responsibilities and potential risks, and to maintain operational security.

  "significance": "While the documents detail the nature and purpose of security briefings, their direct significance to the JFK assassination context is not explicitly stated. The briefings are presented as routine procedures for CIA personnel, and their relevance to the assassination would depend on whether any of the individuals involved in the assassination received or conducted such briefings, and whether those briefings contained information pertinent to the event. Further investigation would be needed to establish any direct link.",
