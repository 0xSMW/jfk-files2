  "summary": "The documents highlight the use of aliases by various individuals and projects, particularly in the context of intelligence operations and investigations related to the JFK assassination. Aliases are used to conceal identities and activities, making it difficult to track individuals and their involvement in sensitive matters. The documents reveal aliases associated with individuals like Robert Scheer, Luis Posada Carriles, and James Earl Ray, as well as projects like ZRRIFLE. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and other investigative bodies requested information on aliases to uncover the true identities and connections of individuals involved in events related to the JFK assassination. The use of aliases is a recurring pattern across the documents, indicating a deliberate effort to obscure identities and activities.",
