  "summary": "Alias documentation refers to false or alternate identification and related paperwork created and used by the CIA, often to support covert operations or protect the identities of agents and assets. In the context of the JFK assassination records, alias documentation is a point of contention between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB). The CIA sought to postpone or redact the release of this documentation, citing concerns about potential damage to diplomatic relations, litigation risks, and the compromise of intelligence collection methods. The ARRB, on the other hand, aimed to release as much information as possible while balancing the need to protect legitimately sensitive information. The documents reveal requests for alias documentation for various individuals, including James Paul Olds, Harold F. Swenson, and Bernard N. HILLARY, detailing specific types of identification needed, such as driver's licenses and social security cards. The timeline spans from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, reflecting both the creation and use of alias documentation during the Cold War and the later debates over its declassification.",

  "significance": "Alias documentation is significant in the JFK assassination context because its potential release could reveal details about covert CIA operations, the identities of individuals involved, and the methods used by the agency. The debate surrounding its release highlights the tension between transparency and national security concerns in the declassification of assassination-related records. The ARRB's efforts to balance these competing interests shaped the final release of information and continue to inform discussions about government secrecy and accountability.",
