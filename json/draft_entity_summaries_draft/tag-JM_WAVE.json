  "summary": "JM/WAVE was a CIA station located in Miami, Florida, during the Cold War. The documents provided indicate its involvement in covert operations against Cuba. Specifically, JM/WAVE was involved in UFGA/Operational matters related to the DRE (Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil) and the infiltration of teams into Cuba for various purposes, such as contacting agents, recruiting dissidents, and caching equipment. The documents span from 1962 to 1996, although the 1996 document appears unrelated to JM/WAVE's primary function, mentioning an individual claiming association with NWBOLTON and alleging sabotage of an article related to the JFK assassination trail. The primary role of JM/WAVE appears to be supporting anti-Castro activities and intelligence gathering operations in Cuba.",
