  "summary": "The documents highlight interrogation as a method used by various intelligence agencies and organizations. Yuriy Nosenko's case involves extensive assessments, including psychological testing and psychiatric evaluations, to determine his truthfulness, suggesting interrogation played a key role in evaluating defectors. The FBI compared CIA's conclusions about Nosenko with information from interrogations of another defector, SAMMY, indicating interrogation's importance in cross-referencing intelligence. AMFAUNA-14's debriefing details her interrogation by the DSE in Cuba, revealing information about her contacts and activities. A classified message discusses plans to arrest and recruit individuals in San Salvador, implying interrogation as a tool for recruitment. While not directly related to the JFK assassination, these documents demonstrate the widespread use of interrogation in intelligence gathering and assessment during the Cold War era, which is the backdrop against which the JFK assassination occurred.",
