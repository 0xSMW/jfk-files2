  "summary": "Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko was a KGB defector who provided information to the FBI and CIA. The documents highlight his debriefings and the scrutiny surrounding his bona fides. He was interviewed by the FBI in 1964, providing information on various topics, including American tourists in Moscow and potential KGB recruitments. Later, in 1968, a memo compares a CIA paper on Nosenko's credibility with information from another defector, indicating discrepancies in the CIA's assessment. In 1978, Nosenko testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) regarding Lee Harvey Oswald's time in the Soviet Union and the KGB's alleged lack of interest in him. The documents reveal a pattern of investigation and analysis surrounding Nosenko's defection and the veracity of his claims.",
