  "summary": "Joachim F. Pehl, also known as Joachim S. Beer, is the step-son of Henry S. Beer. Agent reports from March 4, 1971, detail derogatory information obtained from the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO) regarding incidents involving Joachim while he served in the US Army Berlin Brigade, including a report of a fire and disturbing the peace. A cable dated March 10, 1971, indicates that LAC's and MAC's checks on Joachim were mostly negative or non-derogatory, except for the disturbing the peace incident. The cable also details Joachim Raf. Beer's background as a former labor service employee and his immigration processing.",
