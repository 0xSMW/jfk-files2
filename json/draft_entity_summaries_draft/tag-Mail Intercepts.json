  "summary": "Mail intercepts refer to the practice of intercepting and examining postal mail, often without the sender's or recipient's knowledge or consent. In the context of the documents provided, mail intercepts are mentioned as one of the activities conducted by the CIA's Office of Security, as revealed in Howard J. Osborn's testimony. While the documents do not explicitly link mail intercepts directly to the JFK assassination, the Rockefeller Commission files inventory suggests that the commission investigated CIA activities and the Kennedy assassination, implying a potential, though not directly stated, connection. The documents also reveal that the CIA was concerned about protecting sensitive sources and methods, which could include mail intercepts, from scrutiny by the Senate Committee. The investigation into Luis Tedeschi also hints at the CIA's interest in monitoring communications, although it does not explicitly mention mail intercepts.",
