  "significance": "The 26th of July Movement is significant in the JFK assassination context because it represents the revolutionary force that overthrew the Batista regime, leading to the establishment of a communist government in Cuba under Fidel Castro. This event created significant tensions between the United States and Cuba, leading to events like the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The presence of anti-Castro Cuban exiles, some with connections to the CIA, in the United States created a complex political landscape that some researchers believe played a role in the assassination of President Kennedy.",
