  "summary": "The entity \"All Staff\" refers to the employees of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The documents primarily concern the payroll records of HSCA staff members, with the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) making final determinations regarding the release of these records. A recurring theme is the postponement of releasing Social Security numbers to protect personal privacy. The documents include payroll authorization forms, memoranda related to staff employment, and notifications regarding the ARRB's decisions on these records. Specific staff members mentioned include William K. Triplett, Michael Ewing, Lisa M. Berlow, and William A. Webb, although the documents collectively address the broader category of HSCA staff.",
