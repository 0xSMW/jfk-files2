  "summary": "Hugh C. McDonald is associated with World Associates, Inc. Documents from 1969 detail CIA's assessment of McDonald, his company, security clearances, and potential utilization of his voice identification system and his planned world tour for intelligence gathering. A 1978 memorandum explores the possibility that Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be the 'unidentified man' photographed entering and departing the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City in October 1963, and explores potential connections between MOSKALEV and an individual known as 'Saul' who claimed involvement in the Kennedy assassination. A 1960 memo discusses an Identi-kit project and a magazine article that incorrectly stated the U.S. Intelligence underwrote the development, prompting an investigation into potential disclosure of classified information.",
