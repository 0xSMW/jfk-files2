  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, file reviews represent a process of gathering and analyzing information on individuals who may have been directly or indirectly involved, or who were of interest to investigative bodies like the HSCA. These reviews help to establish connections, assess potential threats, and provide background information relevant to understanding the events surrounding the assassination. The reviews themselves do not directly implicate anyone in the assassination, but they are a part of the broader investigative process.",
