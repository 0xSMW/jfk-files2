  "summary": "The documents mention several individuals acting as Security Officers, primarily within the context of the CIA and related government agencies. Captain William C. Stanley is identified as a Special Security Officer at Langley AFB, and Sgt. Lewis Wesley Leber was interviewed about him. Russell August Langelle used a cover as a State Department Security Officer during his CIA service, including work in Moscow. James W. McCord, Jr., had a personnel file documenting his CIA career. James P. O'Connell, Jr., retired from the CIA after a long career. The role of these Security Officers varies, from providing security at military installations to serving as cover for intelligence operations. While none of the documents directly link a Security Officer to the JFK assassination, the interviews and investigations suggest an interest in their backgrounds and potential connections to relevant events or individuals.",
