  "summary": "The Mexico City Station was a CIA station operating in Mexico City. The documents indicate its involvement in various operations, including maintaining contact with individuals close to Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, as well as a project referred to as 'AMLONG' involving an individual named Alfredo Davins. Later, in the 1990s, the station was tasked with contacting former employees residing in Mexico who had retired under cover, informing them that their names appeared in JFK assassination records being reviewed for public release. This suggests the station's activities, or the activities of its former employees, were relevant to the JFK assassination records, though the specific nature of that relevance is not detailed in these documents.",
