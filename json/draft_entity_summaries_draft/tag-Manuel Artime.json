The documents indicate his activities were monitored by the CIA, including audio surveillance at a safehouse in Bethesda, Maryland.

The documents span from the 1960s to the early 1970s, showing a sustained period of CIA interest and involvement with Artime. One document mentions a double agent (K-1) working to gather intelligence on Cuban exiles and potentially compromise Cuban officials through monitored communications involving Artime.",
