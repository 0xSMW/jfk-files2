  "summary": "MI-6, British Intelligence, appears in these documents primarily in the context of information sharing with U.S. intelligence agencies like the CIA and FBI. Their role involves providing intelligence on individuals and events of interest to the U.S., including potential provocateurs in Cuba, claims related to Lee Harvey Oswald's activities, and information regarding unauthorized travel to Cuba. The documents span from 1961 to 1964, indicating a period of active intelligence exchange. A notable pattern is MI-6's role as a source of information, often relaying reports from other individuals or sources, such as British newspapermen or Cuban Embassy contacts, to U.S. agencies.",
