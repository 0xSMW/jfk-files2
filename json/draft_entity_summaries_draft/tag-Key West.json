  "summary": "Key West appears in the documents primarily as a point of departure or a location connected to covert operations and investigations related to Cuban exile activities. Specifically, one document mentions the TEJANA departing from Key West on February 25, 1961, as part of Operation JEAN, involving the infiltration of cargo and personnel. Other documents reference investigations into Cuban exile groups, such as Cuban Power and MIRR, and their activities in Miami, suggesting Key West's potential role as a transit point or support base for these groups. While not directly linked to the JFK assassination in these documents, the context suggests Key West was a location of interest due to its proximity to Cuba and its potential involvement in covert operations and Cuban exile activities during the early 1960s.",

  "significance": "While not directly linked to the JFK assassination in these documents, Key West's significance lies in its role as a potential staging point or transit location for covert operations and Cuban exile activities during the early 1960s, a period of heightened tensions between the US and Cuba. This makes it a location of interest in understanding the broader context of anti-Castro activities and their potential connections to other events.",
