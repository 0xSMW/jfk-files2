  "summary": "Franc Pecar was a Yugoslav trade official who was of interest to both the CIA and FBI in 1963. The CIA believed Pecar might be willing to defect to the U.S. and requested information from the FBI about him. The FBI, however, advised against the CIA approaching Pecar, citing concerns from New York informants and a recent denial of clearance in a similar case. Pecar's travel plans and meetings, including one with Assistant Attorney General William Kenny in Miami, were monitored. There was also a potential recruitment attempt planned during Pecar's visit to Vienna.",
