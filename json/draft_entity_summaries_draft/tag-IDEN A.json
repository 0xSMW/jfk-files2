The documents suggest involvement in various activities, including facilitating the transmission of materials to PBRUMEN via IDEN B and a diplomatic pouch, which was allegedly used to transmit small arms. One document identifies IDEN A as a wealthy New Orleans businessman used in JMWAVE cover operations, with a request for a 201 file number to be assigned to him. Other documents mention IDEN A in the context of recruitment efforts in Cuba and sensitive information potentially conveyed to [CYFRAIL/1. The timeline spans from 1960 to 1965, indicating sustained involvement in covert operations during this period. The documents suggest a pattern of IDEN A being used as a facilitator or contact point in various clandestine activities.",
