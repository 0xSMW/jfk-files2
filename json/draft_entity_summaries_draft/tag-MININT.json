  "summary": "The documents identify MININT (Ministry of Interior) as the Cuban security apparatus involved in penetrating and monitoring the Cuban human rights/dissident movement in Cuba during the mid-1990s. The reports detail suspected Cuban security penetrations of the Cuban human rights/dissident movement, identifying individuals suspected of being Cuban security sources or provocateurs within dissident groups. The reports outline specific incidents and behaviors that led the CCC leadership to suspect individuals such as Jorge Gonzalez, Vladimiro Roca, Guillermo Fernandez Donates, and Rafael Alcides of being associated with MININT. The information is based on intelligence reports and cables relaying information from sources with contact with dissident groups in Cuba.",
