  "summary": "The documents highlight the use of pseudonyms within CIA operations and their significance in the context of the JFK assassination records. Pseudonyms, along with cryptonyms and aliases, were used to protect the identities of individuals involved in sensitive projects and operations, including those related to Cuban activities and Project ZRRIFLE. The documents reveal the CIA's concern over releasing information that could expose these identities, leading to redactions and deliberations with the ARRB regarding the extent of these redactions. The use of pseudonyms is a recurring theme, indicating a systematic effort to maintain secrecy and protect individuals involved in covert operations.",
