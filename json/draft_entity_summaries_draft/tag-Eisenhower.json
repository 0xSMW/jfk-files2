  "summary": "Dwight D. Eisenhower was the President of the United States during the period when several covert operations and assassination plots were allegedly considered or planned by the CIA. The documents suggest that during his presidency, discussions and plans were formulated regarding the potential assassinations of foreign leaders such as Patrice Lumumba, Fidel Castro, and Rafael Trujillo. The extent of Eisenhower's direct knowledge, authorization, and involvement in these plans is a subject of inquiry. The documents raise questions about the command and control system for covert actions during his administration and the level of awareness among other high-ranking officials.",
