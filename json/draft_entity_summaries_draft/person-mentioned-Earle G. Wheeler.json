The documents focus on US efforts to counter Cuban subversion in Latin America. While Wheeler's specific role is not detailed, his position as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff suggests he was involved in the Department of Defense's actions related to these efforts. The connection to Cuba and the broader context of US-Cuban relations during this period could be relevant to understanding potential motives or actors involved in the assassination, but the documents do not directly link Wheeler to the event.",
