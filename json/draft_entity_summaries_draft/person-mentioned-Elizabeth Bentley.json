Her testimony and information led to investigations of individuals who are mentioned in files related to the JFK assassination investigation, though there is no direct evidence linking her to the assassination itself. Her role as an informant connects her to the broader context of Cold War espionage and the investigations of individuals suspected of Communist ties, some of whom appear in JFK-related files.",
