  "summary": "Juanita Reyes is identified as a character reference for Manuel Marti in November 1968. Investigative efforts were made to contact her to verify information about Marti. Initial attempts to reach her at the provided address were unsuccessful, with reports indicating she no longer resided there and had possibly returned to Puerto Rico. A physical check at an address in the Bronx also yielded negative results. When finally contacted, Reyes stated she did not know Marti. The documents suggest a concerted effort to verify Marti's background through his listed references.",
