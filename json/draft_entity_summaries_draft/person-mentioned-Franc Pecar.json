  "summary": "Franc Pecar was a Yugoslav trade official in 1963 who attracted the attention of both the CIA and FBI. The CIA believed Pecar might be willing to defect to the U.S. and requested information about him from the FBI. The FBI, however, advised against the CIA approaching Pecar, citing concerns from New York informants and a recent denial of clearance in a similar case. The FBI also informed the CIA that Pecar was being recalled to Yugoslavia. The CIA was also tracking Pecar's travel plans and meetings, including one with Assistant Attorney General William Kenny in Miami, and considered a possible recruitment attempt during Pecar's visit to Vienna.",

His connection to Assistant Attorney General William Kenny could also be relevant, though the nature of that connection is not detailed.",
