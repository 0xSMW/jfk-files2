  "summary": "State Cover refers to the practice of CIA employees operating under the guise of being State Department employees. The JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was investigating the CIA's use of State Cover, leading to concerns within the CIA about the potential damage to operations, relationships with liaison services, and the security of station officers if this practice was officially recognized. The CIA was particularly concerned about the release of information on CIA employees operating under State Cover. Assessments were requested from various stations (Moscow, Paris, Mexico City, and Buenos Aires) to evaluate the potential damage from releasing documents confirming this practice. The CIA sought to protect this method of cover.",
