  "summary": "Stokely Carmichael, a prominent figure in the Civil Rights Movement and later the Black Power movement, is mentioned in several documents related to investigations and intelligence gathering during the 1960s and 1970s. While the documents do not directly link him to the JFK assassination, they place him within the context of broader surveillance and monitoring activities conducted by the FBI and CIA during a period of significant social and political unrest. His association with the Black Panther Party and his activism made him a person of interest to these agencies, as evidenced by the collection of newspaper clippings related to Bobby Seale's visit to Norway and his views on the Black Panther Party. The documents suggest that Carmichael's activities and associations were monitored as part of broader efforts to understand and potentially counter domestic dissident groups and their international connections.",
