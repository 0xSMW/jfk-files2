  "summary": "David H. Blee is identified as the sender of two letters, both dated May 21, 1982, to Anthony C. M. DeVere, providing information on Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov. These letters detail Kostikov's activities in Mexico City, including his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald's visa request and suspected involvement with Central American communist parties. Blee is also mentioned in a 1975 memorandum regarding CIA's interactions with the FBI concerning James Earl Ray, where CIA actions were undertaken at the FBI's request. The pattern across the documents suggests Blee was involved in intelligence gathering and reporting, particularly concerning individuals of interest related to national security and potential connections to the JFK assassination.",
