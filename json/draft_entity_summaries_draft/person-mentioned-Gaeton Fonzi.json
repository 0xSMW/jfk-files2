  "summary": "Gaeton Fonzi was a staff member of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The documents indicate that in May 1978, Fonzi, along with Albert Gonzales, visited Guayaquil and Caracas as part of the HSCA's investigation. A CIA station in Guayaquil reported on their upcoming visit and requested guidance on potential contact. Later, in August 1995, Fonzi's name appears in a cable discussing a meeting in Rio de Janeiro involving Cuban CI officers and alleged CIA officers, where the JFK and Letelier assassinations were reviewed. This suggests Fonzi's work with the HSCA involved investigating the JFK assassination, and his name continued to surface in discussions related to the assassination years later.",
