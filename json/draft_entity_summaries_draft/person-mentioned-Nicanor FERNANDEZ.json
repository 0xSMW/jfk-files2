  "significance": "The significance of Nicanor FERNANDEZ in the JFK context is unclear based solely on these documents. His presence in meetings related to anti-Castro activities suggests a potential involvement in the broader context of U.S.-Cuban relations and covert operations, which are sometimes linked to the JFK assassination. However, without more specific information about his role, it is difficult to assess his direct significance.",
