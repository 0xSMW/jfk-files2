  "summary": "Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, appears in these documents primarily in the context of Cold War activities and U.S. intelligence operations. It served as a location for various activities, including the alleged caching of arms and supplies for Cuban exiles by the Dominican Air Force and Navy in 1964. The city is also mentioned as a base for FBI and CIA operations, with cables originating from or directed to Santo Domingo. Individuals of interest, such as Herbert Itkin, had travel restrictions there, and investigations were conducted into their activities. The city also served as a point of origin for information related to Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination and as a location where individuals like Antonio Hector Rivero Juarrero, connected to Mitchell Livingston WerBell, were based.",

It served as a location for intelligence gathering and operations related to individuals and events that may have tangential connections to the JFK assassination, such as individuals with alleged Mafia connections or those involved in anti-Castro activities. The documents suggest that Santo Domingo was a place of interest for U.S. intelligence agencies during the Cold War, and information originating from or passing through the city was deemed relevant to various investigations, including those related to potential threats and conspiracies.",
