  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Johnny Roselli is mentioned in the context of CIA operations and potential assassination attempts, specifically against Fidel Castro. The documents highlight the involvement of individuals like Robert Maheu and William K. Harvey in these operations. Roselli's role appears to be connected to these clandestine activities, although the specific details of his involvement are not explicitly outlined in these summaries. The documents suggest a broader network of individuals and operations related to anti-Castro efforts and potential assassination plots, placing Roselli within this context. The timeline of his involvement is not clearly defined, but the documents span from the 1950s to the 1970s, indicating a potentially long-term association with these activities. A notable pattern is the recurring theme of CIA involvement in sensitive and potentially illegal operations, including assassination attempts and the use of clandestine agents.",
