  "summary": "Social Security Numbers (SSNs) appear in the context of the JFK assassination records primarily within the payroll records of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) frequently issued Final Determination Notifications regarding the postponement of the release of SSNs from these payroll records to protect the personal privacy of HSCA staff. The ARRB determined that releasing SSNs would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, outweighing the public interest in their disclosure. Consequently, many documents related to HSCA staff payroll include redactions or postponements specifically targeting SSNs. These documents often consist of payroll authorization forms, memoranda, resumes, and correspondence related to HSCA employees. The pattern across these documents indicates a consistent effort to balance transparency with the privacy rights of individuals who worked for the HSCA.",

  "significance": "In the JFK assassination context, Social Security Numbers themselves do not directly relate to the events of the assassination. Their significance lies in the legal and ethical considerations surrounding the release of personal information contained within government records related to the investigation. The postponement of their release highlights the tension between the public's right to access information and the individual's right to privacy, as adjudicated by the ARRB.",
