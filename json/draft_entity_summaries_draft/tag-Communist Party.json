The documents also highlight the Communist Party's presence in anti-war movements, such as the Vietnam Day Committee, and its connections to other leftist organizations. Furthermore, the documents suggest that the Communist Party was a target of intelligence gathering efforts by both the CIA and FBI, with informants being used to gather information on their activities and connections. The documents also reference the Communist Party of El Salvador requesting explosives and Cuba's involvement.",
