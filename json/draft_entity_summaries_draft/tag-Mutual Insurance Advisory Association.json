  "summary": "The Mutual Insurance Advisory Association (MIAA) appears in the documents as the former employer of Manuel Marti. Marti worked at MIAA from April 1965 to May 1968 before entering military service. Several agent reports and an identification form reference MIAA to verify Marti's employment history and gather character references from his former colleagues and supervisors, including Albert B. Cassidy Jr., George J. Ferraro, and Lucien Todman. These references were collected as part of an investigation into Marti's suitability for a position of trust with the U.S. government.",
