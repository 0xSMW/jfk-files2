  "summary": "William Hamilton Martin was an American who defected to the USSR. The documents indicate he was connected to espionage activities and had associations with individuals suspected of Soviet intelligence connections, such as George S. PERISTEROPOULOS. A memo from 1960 requests information on PERISTEROPOULOS and his relationship to Martin and Valentine Hahn. In 1975, Martin, along with Bernon Ferguson Mitchell, sought to leave the USSR, which was communicated through Canadian liaison channels. The FBI was aware of this situation. Other documents mention Nicholas Georges Damascus and Anastasia Magdalene Martiliane Daskalakis, but the connection to Martin is not explicitly stated.",
