  "summary": "The term 'Secret' appears in the documents primarily as a security classification level, indicating the sensitivity of the information contained within. One document refers to a security approval granting 'SECRET' clearance to Myroslaw Andrew Maksymiec, later upgraded to 'TOP SECRET' under certain conditions. Another document, detailing the AMCANOE project, reveals covert CIA operations involving Cuban exiles and potential assassination plots, implying that the information within is highly sensitive and classified. While 'Secret' itself isn't a direct actor or organization, its presence highlights the clandestine nature of the activities and information being discussed in the context of Cuban operations and security clearances during the period surrounding the JFK assassination.",
