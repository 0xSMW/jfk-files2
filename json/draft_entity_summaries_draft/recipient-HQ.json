HQ receives information on individuals like Joseph Raymond Merola, who claimed CIA connections, and Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko, a KGB defector.

While the documents do not directly link HQ to the assassination, they highlight the FBI's efforts to monitor and investigate individuals and groups that could pose a threat, including those with connections to anti-Castro movements and foreign intelligence agencies. The documents suggest that HQ was a central hub for intelligence related to potential threats and espionage activities during the period leading up to and following the assassination.",
