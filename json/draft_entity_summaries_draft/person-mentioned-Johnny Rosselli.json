  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Johnny Rosselli is mentioned in the context of CIA activities and potential assassination plots. While the documents do not explicitly detail Rosselli's role in the JFK assassination, they place him within a network of individuals involved in sensitive and potentially illegal operations. The documents suggest connections to individuals like Robert Maheu, who worked with the CIA on sensitive assignments, and references to CIA projects like ZRRIFLE, which involved assassination planning. The timeline of Rosselli's involvement is not clearly defined in these documents, but the testimonies from 1975 suggest that his activities were under scrutiny during that period. The documents highlight the CIA's involvement with individuals who had connections to organized crime, which is a common theme in JFK assassination theories.",
