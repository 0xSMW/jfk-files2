  "summary": "WIROGUE refers to a CIA project or agent, as indicated by the documents. The project involved the recruitment, training, and operational deployment of an agent, designated as WIROGUE/1 in at least one instance, in Leopoldville. The documents cover various aspects of managing this agent, including operational plans, financial and security concerns, and administrative handling. There were concerns about the agent's potential return to the Congo due to security risks, and efforts were made to manage his documentation and prevent his return. Later documents indicate the termination of WIROGUE's service, resettlement efforts, attempts to find him employment, and concerns about his potential to reveal sensitive information. The AEASPIC operation is also mentioned in connection with WIROGUE.",
