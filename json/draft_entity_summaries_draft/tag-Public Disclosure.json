  "summary": "The documents relate to the potential public disclosure of information, specifically names of former CIA employees, under the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The CIA's Office of Covert Communications (OCC) is contacting various stations (Paris, Bonn, Mexico City, Hong Kong) to request assistance in informing these former employees that their names appear in JFK assassination records and may be released to the public. The cables offer guidance to the former employees on how to respond, including the possibility of requesting postponement of public disclosure. One document mentions a LACOS contact expressing concerns about the public disclosure of their association with TOHIGHROAD due to privacy and security issues related to their overseas cover. The timeline is primarily focused on March-June 1997, indicating a concentrated effort to comply with the JFK Records Collection Act.",
