  "summary": "Helsinki, Finland, appears in the documents primarily in relation to Lee Harvey Oswald's stay there in October 1959. The CIA was interested in the timeline of Oswald's stay, particularly his contact with the Soviet Consulate in Helsinki, likely prompted by the Warren Commission's inquiry. Additionally, Helsinki is mentioned as a transit point for a source (AELADLE) in May 1961 who was later interrogated by the KGB in Moscow about contacts with the KGB Legal Residency in Helsinki. The documents suggest that Helsinki served as a location of interest for intelligence activities and potential Soviet contacts relevant to individuals connected to Cold War espionage.",
