The documents suggest that ZRRIFLE was part of a broader set of covert operations during the Cold War, and its connection to individuals and events scrutinized by the SSCIA and the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) makes it relevant to understanding the historical context surrounding the JFK assassination.",
