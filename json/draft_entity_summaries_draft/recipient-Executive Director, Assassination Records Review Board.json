  "summary": "The Executive Director of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) is the recipient of several memoranda from the CIA regarding the release of information related to the JFK assassination. These documents highlight the CIA's concerns about releasing certain types of information, including the identities of human intelligence sources, details about the Warrenton Training Center (WTC), alias documentation, accommodation addresses, and information about the CIA's commercial cover program. The CIA sought the ARRB's reconsideration on releasing information that could potentially damage national security, compromise intelligence operations, or endanger individuals. The memoranda span from September 1996 to May 1998, indicating a period of ongoing negotiation and discussion between the CIA and the ARRB regarding the declassification of JFK assassination records. A notable pattern across the documents is the CIA's consistent emphasis on protecting human sources and intelligence methods while complying with the JFK Act.",
