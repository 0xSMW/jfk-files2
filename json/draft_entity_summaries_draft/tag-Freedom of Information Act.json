  "summary": "The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a law that grants the public access to information possessed by government agencies. In the context of the JFK assassination records, FOIA plays a significant role as it governs the release, declassification, and review of documents related to the assassination. The CIA, in particular, was involved in efforts to comply with FOIA requests and address concerns about potential leaks of sensitive information. The documents reveal that FOIA considerations influenced decisions regarding the sharing of information with Congressional committees, such as the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), particularly concerning potentially sensitive sources and methods. The timeline spans from the 1970s, with initial concerns about FOIA requests, to the 1990s, with the implementation of the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1992, highlighting ongoing efforts to balance transparency with national security concerns.",
