  "summary": "Backstopping, in the context of these documents, refers to the establishment of cover identities and support structures for individuals, often agents or assets, to conceal their true affiliations and activities. This involves creating plausible employment histories, residential addresses, and business ventures to provide a legitimate facade. The documents highlight various methods of backstopping, including using cover firms like Ashmond, Twiford Associates and Roberts Electronic and Engineering Service, as well as leveraging existing organizations such as the U.S. Army Staff Group. The purpose of backstopping is to protect the identities of individuals involved in covert operations and to provide them with a credible explanation for their activities.",

  "significance": "While these documents do not directly link backstopping to the JFK assassination, they illustrate the CIA's operational practices of creating cover identities and support structures for individuals. This is significant in the context of the JFK assassination because it demonstrates the agency's capability and willingness to engage in covert activities, which could be relevant when investigating potential agency involvement or cover-ups related to the assassination.",
