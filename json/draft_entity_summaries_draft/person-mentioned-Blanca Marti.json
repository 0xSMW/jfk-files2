  "significance": "Blanca Marti's significance in the JFK context appears to be minimal and indirect. She is mentioned only as a sibling of Manuel Marti, who was under investigation by the FBI. Her inclusion in the documents seems to stem from the investigation into her brother rather than any direct involvement in events related to the JFK assassination.",
