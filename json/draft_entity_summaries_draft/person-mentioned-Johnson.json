  "significance": "The significance of \"Johnson\" in the JFK assassination context is indirect but potentially relevant. The documents highlight Johnson's involvement in Operation Mongoose, which included covert actions against Cuba and alleged assassination plots against Fidel Castro. While not directly linked to the JFK assassination, these activities provide context for the political climate and potential motivations of various actors during that period. The reference to a threat against the 'Johnson gang' also suggests a level of political tension and opposition.",
