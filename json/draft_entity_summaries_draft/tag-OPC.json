  "summary": "The documents refer to \"OPC\" in the context of John F. Rittenhouse's employment and assignment. Rittenhouse's status was changed from OPC Staff Employee to OPC Staff Agent, and he was assigned to Mexico City as a GS-13 Intelligence Officer under State Department deep cover. His security clearance was later canceled, and he was reclassified as a semi-covert employee integrated into a department. The documents suggest OPC was an organization or branch within the CIA involved in covert operations and intelligence gathering, specifically related to overseas assignments and agent management. The documents do not provide enough information to determine OPC's role or significance in the JFK assassination context.",
