  "summary": "Non-Official Cover (NOC) refers to individuals working for the CIA under disguises that do not overtly identify them as government employees. These covers are designed to protect their true identities and activities, allowing them to operate with greater discretion and reduced risk of exposure. The documents highlight the use of NOCs in various locations such as Cuba, Venezuela, and Spain. The documents also emphasize the importance of security and vetting processes to ensure that NOCs are not compromised by foreign intelligence services. The establishment of NOCs often involves creating elaborate backstories and utilizing existing businesses or organizations as fronts. The use of NOCs is a recurring theme in the documents, indicating their importance in covert operations.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the documents suggest that the HSCA was interested in interviewing NOCs, indicating a potential link between these individuals and the events surrounding the assassination. The emphasis on protecting sources and operational security during these interviews suggests that the information held by NOCs was considered sensitive and potentially relevant to the investigation. However, the documents do not explicitly state the role of NOCs in the JFK assassination, but rather highlight the CIA's efforts to cooperate with the HSCA while safeguarding its operations and personnel.",
