  "summary": "The documents mention Duvalier in the context of US intelligence operations and political situations in Haiti and Cuba. Duvalier's Haiti appears as a location for Cuban intelligence activities, as well as a point of contact for individuals involved in anti-Castro efforts and arms dealings. The documents suggest that Haiti under Duvalier was a region of interest for both Cuban and US intelligence, and a potential staging ground for activities related to Cuba. There is no direct mention of Duvalier's involvement in the JFK assassination, but the documents highlight Haiti's role in the broader geopolitical landscape of the time.",
