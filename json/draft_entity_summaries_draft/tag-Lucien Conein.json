  "summary": "Lucien Conein was a CIA operative, as revealed in an FBI memo from 1966 initiated by a request from French authorities. The memo details Conein's assignment in Saigon and a CIA request to keep his affiliation secret from the French. Further documents indicate Conein's involvement with individuals like Arthur R. Schwickrath and potential connections to Mitchell Livingston WerBell, III, who was investigated for internal security matters, neutrality issues, and possible links to narcotics and the CIA. Documents from the 1970s suggest concerns about Conein's compromised cover and interactions with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) regarding employment verification.",
