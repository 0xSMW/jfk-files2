  "summary": "The Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) is featured in a series of documents primarily concerning the declassification of Warren Commission documents CD-971 and CD-071. Sir Charles Spry, representing ASIO, communicated with Richard Helms of the CIA regarding these documents. Specifically, Spry recommended against the declassification of CD-971, which pertained to an investigation of anonymous telephone calls to the Canberra Embassy before and after President Kennedy's assassination. Helms assured Spry that the CIA had no current plans to declassify either document, citing Spry's recommendations and the absence of public pressure. The documents highlight a collaborative relationship between ASIO and the CIA regarding the handling of sensitive information related to the JFK assassination investigation.",

Their recommendation against declassification suggests they possessed information deemed sensitive to national security or international relations.",
