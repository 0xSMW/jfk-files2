  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination records, Moscow's significance lies in its role as a focal point for intelligence gathering and potential interactions with individuals who may have had connections to the assassination. The documents suggest that individuals with ties to Moscow, such as defectors or intelligence officers, were of interest to investigators. The presence of individuals like Lee Harvey Oswald in some documents, even tangentially, adds to the significance of Moscow as a location potentially relevant to understanding the events surrounding the assassination.",
