  "summary": "Olien is identified as an individual who handled other individuals, as indicated in a 1961 message. The message confirms the accuracy of statements made by Luis Alberto de Jesus Condo: Cajisal and identifies individuals handled by OLIEN. The message also offers assistance to Cajisal if he desires to travel to the WAVE area. The other documents do not provide additional context about Olien, but they do relate to CIA activities involving anti-Castro Cuban groups and individuals, including Julio Lanier Hevia, Manuel Ray y Rivero, and others, covering the period from 1960 to 1963 and later reviews in the 1970s.",
