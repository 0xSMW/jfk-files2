Another document mentions an individual ('DESIGNET') traveling on business for IDEN B, with plans to visit Switzerland and return to PERUMEN before a debriefing/briefing. IDEN B is also mentioned in a report on the activities of AMWORLD, based on information obtained from former members IDEN A and IDEN B.
