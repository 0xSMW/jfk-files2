  "summary": "The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) is a committee of the United States House of Representatives tasked with oversight of the United States Intelligence Community. The documents provided show the committee's interactions with the CIA's Office of Legislative Counsel in 1978. These interactions covered a range of topics, including the leak of NSA's ability to read Korean diplomatic traffic, damage assessments, the Agency's relationship with public television, access to Church Committee transcripts, hearings, information requests, budget briefings, terrorism hearings, codeword cover sheets, file destruction, and intelligence reports. The committee's oversight role is evident in its engagement with sensitive intelligence matters and its interactions with various agencies and committees.",
