  "summary": "Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko was a Soviet KGB officer who defected to the United States in 1964. The documents primarily focus on the CIA's investigation into Nosenko's bona fides, attempting to determine whether he was a genuine defector or a KGB plant. This involved extensive interviews, polygraph tests, and analysis of his background, KGB career, intelligence, relationships, and motivations. The CIA considered various scenarios, including the possibility of escape, suicide, or turn-back. The House Select Committee on Assassinations also reviewed materials related to Nosenko, including legal justifications for his confinement by the CIA and discussions with the Department of Justice. Some documents contain redacted information to protect ongoing CIA operations.",
