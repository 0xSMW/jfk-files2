  "summary": "The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was established to oversee the declassification and release of government records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, as mandated by the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The ARRB worked to identify, review, and make publicly available assassination-related documents held by various government agencies, including the CIA, FBI, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). A significant part of their work involved negotiating with these agencies regarding the release of sensitive information, balancing the public interest in transparency with concerns about national security and personal privacy. A recurring theme in the documents is the ARRB's role in determining the release status of HSCA staff payroll records, often postponing the release of Social Security numbers to protect personal privacy. They also engaged in discussions with the CIA regarding the release of information that could reveal intelligence sources, methods, and facilities, such as the Warrenton Training Center, and sought additional information and records related to Lee Harvey Oswald's pre-assassination activities.",
