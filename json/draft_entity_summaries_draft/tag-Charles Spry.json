  "summary": "Sir Charles Spry is mentioned in correspondence regarding the declassification of Warren Commission documents. Specifically, Richard Helms wrote to Spry on multiple occasions in 1968 regarding Warren Commission documents CD-971 and CD-071. In these letters, Helms assures Spry that the CIA has no current plans to declassify these documents, based on Spry's recommendation against it. The letters acknowledge Spry's reasons for keeping the documents private and confirm that there is no public pressure for their release. This suggests Spry held a position where his opinion on declassifying sensitive information was valued and acted upon by the CIA.",
