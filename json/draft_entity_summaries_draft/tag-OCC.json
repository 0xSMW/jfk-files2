Their role in the JFK assassination context appears to be related to the potential public release of names of former employees in JFK assassination records, as mandated by the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The OCC was tasked with contacting these former employees residing in locations like Paris and Caracas, informing them about the potential release of their names, and offering guidance. The documents span from 1996 to 1997, indicating a period of activity related to compliance with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act. A notable pattern is the concern for the privacy and potential impact on former employees due to the release of their names.",
