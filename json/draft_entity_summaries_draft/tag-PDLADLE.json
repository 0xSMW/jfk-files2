  "summary": "PDLADLE appears to be a high-level defector who was of interest to the CIA. Queries were made about PDLADLE in conjunction with PDIPPERS 19 and 20, and Wallenberg. There were considerations for an outside lawyer to draw up a Deed of Trust for PDLADLE, taking into account security, operational use, and legal implications. PDLADLE and Nosenko were considered for questioning regarding the Wallenberg case. There was a directive to refrain from publishing material from PDLADLE in BKHERALD due to existing liaison equities and the source's un-surfaced status. A meeting occurred in New York City where PDLADLE and his wife mortgaged a property in favor of a CIA-devised facility nominee, Roush-Walker Company.",
