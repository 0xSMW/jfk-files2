  "summary": "CORU (Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations) was an organization of Cuban exiles. The documents indicate CORU's involvement in various activities, including a meeting in the Dominican Republic in June 1976, and potential connections to the death of Orlando Letelier. One document mentions an attack on a Cuban Embassy attache's house in Lima, Peru, and references coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations. The documents also suggest connections to individuals like Rolando Otero Hernandez, who coordinated between exiles in Miami and Santiago, Chile, and Luis Posada Carriles, who was involved in terrorist plotting by Cuban exiles. The timeline of involvement spans at least from June 1976 to March 1977, based on the dates of the documents.",

  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, CORU's significance in the JFK context is not explicitly stated. However, the organization's association with anti-Castro activities and Cuban exiles, as well as individuals potentially linked to the CIA, could be relevant in understanding the broader landscape of actors and motivations surrounding US-Cuba relations during that period. Further research would be needed to establish a direct connection to the JFK assassination.",
