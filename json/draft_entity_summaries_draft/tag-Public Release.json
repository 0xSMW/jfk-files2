  "summary": "The 'Public Release' tag in these documents refers to the process mandated by the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which required the review and potential release of documents related to the JFK assassination. The CIA was involved in identifying former employees whose names appeared in these documents and contacting them to inform them of the potential public release. The CIA offered these individuals the opportunity to provide reasons why their names should not be released. The documents span from 1995 to 1997, indicating a period of active review and notification following the Act's passage. A notable pattern is the CIA's proactive approach in contacting former employees residing in various locations (Vienna, Caracas, Costa Rica) to ensure compliance with the Act and to address potential concerns regarding privacy.",
