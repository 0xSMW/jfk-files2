  "summary": "The documents indicate that Puerto Rico served as a location for FBI and CIA activities related to individuals and operations of interest during the JFK era. Several documents detail FBI local agency checks conducted in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on individuals named Marti and their family members, including checks of birth records and name changes. One document reveals a CIA clandestine operation in San Juan to contaminate Cuban sugar being shipped to the Soviet Union. Additionally, a court order from Puerto Rico legally changing a person's name is documented, impacting the birth certificates of his sons. These documents suggest Puerto Rico was a place where investigations, operations, and legal processes relevant to individuals and events connected to the JFK assassination context took place.",
