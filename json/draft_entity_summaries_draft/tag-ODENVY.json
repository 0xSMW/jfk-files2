  "significance": "ODENVY's significance in the JFK context is primarily related to its involvement in the LIENVOY project, which monitored contacts made by Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City before the assassination. This suggests that ODENVY may have had information or played a role in surveillance activities related to Oswald's activities prior to the assassination. Additionally, its connections to Cuban and Soviet intelligence targets in Mexico City could be relevant to understanding potential foreign involvement in the assassination.",
