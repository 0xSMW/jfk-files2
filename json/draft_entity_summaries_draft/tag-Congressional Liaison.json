  "summary": "Congressional Liaison, in the context of these documents, refers to the CIA's interactions with members of Congress and their staff. This involved managing requests for information, arranging meetings, and providing access to sensitive materials. The Office of Legislative Counsel within the CIA played a key role in these liaison activities. These interactions were particularly important during the period when Congressional committees, such as the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), were investigating the JFK assassination and related matters. The CIA sought to manage the flow of information to Congress, address concerns, and navigate the inquiries of these committees.",
