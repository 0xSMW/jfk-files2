  "summary": "Costa Rica appears in the documents primarily as a location for CIA operations, agent activities, and as a transit point or residence for individuals of interest. It served as a base for Guatemalan exiles in 1956, a location for Project HUMANOID, and a meeting place for drug traffickers. The CIA sought operational clearances for agents to be used in Costa Rica as early as 1954. In the 1990s, the CIA contacted former employees residing in Costa Rica regarding the release of their names under the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act. The documents also mention alleged illicit armament traffic and communist activities in Costa Rica in 1950. Overall, Costa Rica's significance lies in its geographical role as a site for various covert activities and as a place of residence for individuals connected to CIA operations and other events of interest.",

  "significance": "Costa Rica's significance in the JFK context is primarily related to the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act, which prompted the CIA to contact former employees residing in Costa Rica to inform them about the potential public release of their information. This suggests that individuals with connections to the CIA and potentially relevant information about the JFK assassination may have resided or operated in Costa Rica.",
