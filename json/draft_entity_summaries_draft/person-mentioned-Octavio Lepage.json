  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, Octavio Lepage is mentioned in connection with Ricardo Morales Navarrete and Orlando Bosch, both figures of interest in the context of Cuban exile activities and potential threats. The documents suggest Lepage was likely a Venezuelan security official, possibly connected to U.S. intelligence, given the references to Venezuelan security officials being U.S. intelligence agents. The documents span from 1977 to 1978, indicating a period of interest in Lepage's activities or associations during that time. The documents do not explicitly link Lepage to the JFK assassination, but his association with individuals involved in anti-Castro activities and potential U.S. intelligence connections places him within a network of individuals relevant to investigations surrounding the assassination.",
