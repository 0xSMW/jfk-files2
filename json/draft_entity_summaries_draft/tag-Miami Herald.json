  "summary": "The Miami Herald is a newspaper that appears in several CIA documents related to JMWAVE operations. The documents reveal that the CIA, through JMWAVE, had a relationship with at least one journalist (AMCARDON-1) at the Miami Herald. This journalist provided operational support, intelligence, and served as a propaganda outlet for the CIA from December 1962 to March 1964. Additionally, the Miami Herald published articles concerning Cuban exile leadership, specifically the replacement of Miro Cardona by Manuel Ray, allegedly with U.S. backing, which caused concern within the CIA and the Cuban community. The CIA actively monitored and responded to these articles, planning to discredit certain stories and reassure Miro Cardona.",

  "significance": "The Miami Herald's significance in the JFK context lies in its connection to CIA propaganda efforts and its role in reporting on Cuban exile activities. The use of a Miami Herald journalist as a CIA asset highlights the agency's attempts to influence public opinion and gather intelligence through media channels. The newspaper's coverage of Cuban exile leadership changes also reflects the political tensions and U.S. involvement in the Cuban community during this period.",
