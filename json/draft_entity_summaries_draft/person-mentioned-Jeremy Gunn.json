The documents highlight the ARRB's requests for information from the CIA, the CIA's concerns about protecting sensitive information (such as covert employee identities and ongoing operations), and the negotiations between the two entities regarding the scope and timing of document releases. Gunn's involvement would have been during the mid-1990s, coinciding with the ARRB's mandate to review and release JFK assassination records.",
