  "summary": "Victor L. Trinkala is a person of interest due to his connection with Richard C. Nagell and his underage enlistment in the U.S. Army. In 1969, an anonymous tip suggested Trinkala, en route to Vietnam and identified as a Conscientious Objector, had been contacted by a \"Soviet Agent\" for potential anti-U.S. propaganda. Trinkala sought discharge from the Army, claiming he was underage at enlistment, and his records incorrectly stated his birthdate. He was interviewed in February 1970 regarding his character and loyalty, during which he was perceived as reluctant. Trinkala provided a sworn statement in February 1970, discussing his conscientious objector status, his discharge, and his limited contact with Richard Nagell, whom he believed aided his discharge. The investigation also explored Nagell's potential involvement in Trinkala's separation from military service.",
