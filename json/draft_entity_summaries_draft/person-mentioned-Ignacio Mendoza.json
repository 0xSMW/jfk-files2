  "summary": "Ignacio Mendoza is identified as a 'Ray Contact' in Havana, as indicated in a message from the HAVANA Station dated November 18, 1960. According to the message, Ignacio's brother, Nicolas Mendoza, informed the station that Ignacio delayed his departure from Havana in the hope of obtaining legal permission from the Cuban government to leave. The documents available suggest a connection to Manuel Ray y Rivero, a figure in the Cuban exile community, and involvement in anti-Castro activities. The limited information available does not provide a clear timeline of his involvement or his significance in the JFK assassination context beyond his association with Ray and potential involvement in anti-Castro activities.",
