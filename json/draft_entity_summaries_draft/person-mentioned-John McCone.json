The documents related to the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 indicate that the CIA reviewed documents under McCone's tenure for potential relevance to the assassination. His involvement in covert operations against Cuba, a topic of intense interest in the JFK assassination investigations, further underscores his significance.",
