  "summary": "Sanitization, in the context of the JFK assassination records, refers to the process of redacting or removing sensitive information from documents before their release to the public. This process is mentioned in several documents related to the CIA's review of JFK assassination records, meetings with the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), and responses to FOIA requests. The CIA balanced transparency with the need to protect sensitive sources, methods, and foreign relations. The ARRB played a role in decisions regarding sanitized releases. The documents indicate that sanitization was a recurring issue in the release of JFK assassination-related documents, reflecting the tension between public access and national security concerns.",
