  "summary": "UMWAVE appears to be a CIA station, as indicated by a classified message from UMWAVE to the Director concerning the planned training of ALICE INFILS for future operations. The documents available do not directly link UMWAVE to the JFK assassination. Instead, they highlight UMWAVE's involvement in Cuban operations during the early 1960s, including the training of personnel for infiltration (ALICE INFILS) and monitoring activities on the island, such as Soviet movements, cargo traffic, and observations at the Torrens base. The documents span from 1961 to 1963, suggesting a period of active intelligence gathering and operational planning related to Cuba.",
