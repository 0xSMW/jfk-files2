This support included using journalists like AMCARBON-1/AMCARDON-1 as propaganda outlets and intelligence sources, as well as establishing connections with state, county, and local police in the Miami area. The Minsk Station also details general operational support activities. These activities were crucial for maintaining covert operations and gathering information.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the operational support provided to and by entities like JMWAVE is significant because it highlights the CIA's extensive network of contacts and resources. The use of journalists for propaganda and intelligence, as well as the close relationship with local law enforcement, raises questions about the potential influence and involvement of these entities in events surrounding the assassination. The documents suggest a pattern of covert activities and information control, which could be relevant to understanding the broader context of the JFK assassination.",
