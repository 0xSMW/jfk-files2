The memo explicitly states, \"significant damage to mission, people, and the very existence of the Warrenton Training Center (WTC) would occur as a result of the second- and third-order effects of any confirmed affiliation with the Agency.\" It details that revealing WTC's connection to the CIA could jeopardize lives, disrupt the Agency's mission, compromise classified communications, and harm national security. Furthermore, the memo mentions the potential compromise of covert employees in overseas assignments and the loss of a secure Emergency Relocation Site for the Director of Central Intelligence.",

  "summary_one_paragraph": "This series of memoranda from September and November 1996 and October 1997 pertains to the Central Intelligence Agency's efforts to prevent the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) from releasing information that would reveal the Warrenton Training Center (WTC) as a CIA facility. The memos outline the potential damage to national security, including jeopardizing lives, disrupting agency missions, and compromising covert communications. The CIA argues that revealing WTC's affiliation with the Agency would expose covert employees, compromise emergency relocation sites, and make the facility a target for hostile entities, requesting that the ARRB defer the release of such information.",
