A former Cuban IS officer reported seeing Novas at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City in March 1964. However, subsequent reports from a Jamaican source indicate that Novas arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, on March 18, 1964, to serve as Commercial Attache at the Cuban Consulate. He is described as having an American appearance, speaking excellent English, and being preoccupied with women. Intelligence suggests his appointment may indicate he is the new Cuban Intelligence Service chief in Jamaica, succeeding Gerardo SANCHEZ Robert.",
