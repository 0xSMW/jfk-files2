  "summary_one_paragraph": "In a sworn statement taken on February 19, 1970, by the 108th MI Group, Victor Lee Trinkala detailed the circumstances surrounding his discharge from the Army and his connections to Richard Nagell. Trinkala, who identifies as a conscientious objector, explains that he was discharged on December 3, 1969, after only five months of service, and that a friend of a friend, Richard Nagell, may have assisted in securing his discharge. The interview covers Trinkala's attitudes toward military service, his contacts with dissident groups (which he denies), and his allegiance to the United States, concluding with his affirmation that he would defend the country against invasion but opposes fighting in Viet Nam due to his moral objections.",
