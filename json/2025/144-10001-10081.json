The Hungarian press, television, and radio attributed the assassination to fascist elements and racial hatred, but despite emphasizing grief, principal government figures did not visit the U.S. Legation to offer condolences, and the President's telegram was not published. The Hungarian funeral delegation was of low rank, led by acting Foreign Minister PETER MOD, indicating restrained official grief, although the general public was reportedly deeply touched by the news.",
