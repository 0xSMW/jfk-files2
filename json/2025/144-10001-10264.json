  "security": "These cables discuss Cuban diplomatic and military activities in relation to the JFK assassination, including reactions to Oswald's actions and security measures taken after Kennedy's death. Releasing specific details about Cuban intelligence assessments, sources, or methods (e.g., specific agent names like \"SERAFIN\", or the existence of communications exercises), and their perspectives on the events, might compromise intelligence sources, methods, or ongoing operations. Directly quoting \"Alert in Oriente Province believed to be terminated\" exposes Cuban military responses to Kennedy's death.",
