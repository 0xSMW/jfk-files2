  "summary_one_paragraph": "On October 15, 1963, the CIA issued an information report based on a source (a Western businessman) with contacts to Nguyen Hoang Cuong, the Executive Secretary of the National Economic Council, who reported that in early October, Vice President Nguyen Ngoc Tho informed him that a cabinet meeting had decided to recommend to President Diem the appointment of Ngo Dinh Nhu as Prime Minister. The rationale behind this proposal was that if Diem did not intend to reduce Nhu's influence, making him an official government figure would at least hold him accountable for his actions, necessitating a constitutional amendment to be voted on by the National Assembly.",
