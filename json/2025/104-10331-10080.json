  "summary_one_paragraph": "This internal memo, dated January 3, 1996, from an unknown sender within CSI to the D/CSI, concerns the JFK appeal process related to ARRB decisions. It discusses a memorandum being prepared by DO/IMS (with OGC support) requesting an appeal of certain ARRB decisions, focusing on the LICRYPT issue (liaison with Mexicans) and the release of information about four CIA stations. HRG reviewers express reservations about appealing the LICRYPT issue due to previously released information, support the appeal in Attachment B, and suggest opening a Nov/Dec 1963 window for Oswald-related documents instead of appealing the release of the four stations, while also raising concerns about the State Department's involvement due to potential impacts on cover and foreign relations.",
