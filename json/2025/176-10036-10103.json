  "summary_one_paragraph": "In mid-March 1963, a CIA information telegram reported that representatives of a committee of nationalist anti-communist political oppositionists in South Vietnam sought American support for the overthrow of the Diem regime, suggesting that without American aid, they would seek support from other sources. The oppositionists claimed the country had reached an impasse, asserting that Diem remained in power only due to American military support and that the Diem government was untenable, proposing the elimination of Ngo Dinh Nhu and his wife for potential re-orientation of Diem. Furthermore, they criticized the strategic hamlet program as heavily infiltrated by Vietnamese Communists and the Republican Youth Movement as superficial, warning of a renewed VC offensive.",
