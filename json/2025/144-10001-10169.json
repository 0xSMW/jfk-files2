  "summary_one_paragraph": "An NSA COMINT report, classified as SECRET KIMBO and dated November 26, 1963, relays that an alert in Oriente Province, Cuba, seemingly initiated by President Kennedyâ€™s assassination on November 22, 1963, was believed to have ended on November 25, 1963. Supporting this belief, the report notes the lifting of restricted access to the Coastal Observation Post at Punta Maisi and the absence of further orders to subordinates of Banes Headquarters Eastern Naval District, coupled with the Cuban Navy engaging in an island-wide communications exercise on November 25. Moreover, communications from CRAF and Soviet Forces in Cuba appeared normal during the period from November 22-26, 1963, indicating a return to standard operating procedures.",
