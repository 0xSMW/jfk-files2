The communication references an informant's tip that Sams is suspected by gamblers in New Kensington of either having a high-placed informant within the Pittsburgh Federal Building or being an informant for a federal agency because he consistently avoids IRS raids. The Director instructs the SAC to leverage this information to gain insights from Sams or disrupt his operations within Mannarino's organization.",
