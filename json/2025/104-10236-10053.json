  "summary_one_paragraph": "This secret CIA message, dated October 11, 1962, addresses the establishment of an AMBUD delegation in Jamaica. It relays the COS's assessment that the Jamaican government wishes to remain neutral in the Cold War due to its Cuban community and concerns for safety. The message advises against any overt pressure that could jeopardize future cooperation with the Jamaican government. It also mentions the possibility of leveraging Frank (Diaz) Silveira during the Caribbean Games but insists on no public announcements before Jamaican governmental approval. The document suggests that pushing the AMBUD presence against the government's wishes could strengthen pro-Cuban elements within Jamaica.",
