  "summary_one_paragraph": "This May 10, 1965, FBI memo, originating from HQ and classified as Secret, details information received from a highly confidential source (CPRIME) regarding Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa's views on Cuba's deteriorating situation as of February 1963. Roa expressed concerns about the Sino-Indian conflict benefiting the United States, the failure of UN talks, and conditions resembling the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; he also critiqued the Organization of American States' handling of the Cuban situation, noting Mexico's reservations and the expected actions of Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil. Roa felt it would have been better if the UN Security Council had addressed the Cuban issue. He acknowledged that time allowed Cuba to consolidate internally but also highlighted differences within NATO and hopes for relaxed international relations, while appearing to disagree with the Soviet Union's 1962 missile placement in Cuba.",
