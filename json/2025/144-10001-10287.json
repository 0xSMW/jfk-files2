Grube, responds to the ARRB's questions regarding NSA targeting priorities and capabilities against Cuba and Mexico from 1963-1964. The NSA tasked elements to search for relevant information and reviewed USIB records, detailing SIGINT objectives to gather information on Soviet and Cuban military capabilities, internal warfare efforts, and political developments. The response indicates the NSA had capabilities to exploit Cuban cryptosystems and collected communications to and from Cuban embassies in various countries, while also targeting Mexican diplomatic communications, but found no records directly related to the JFK assassination beyond those already provided to the ARRB.",
