Quoting directly: 'The operation was never conceived, certainly, carried out during the period I was associated with it, but was never conceived as an assassination plot. It was conceived as a coup in order to organize a military group within Cuba to overthrow Castro.' This reveals the CIA's intent to influence or overthrow foreign governments.",

  "summary_one_paragraph": "This top-secret transcript from a February 11, 1976, Senate Select Committee hearing details the AMLASH operation, during which the CIA sought to organize a military coup against Fidel Castro in Cuba. The testimony of an AMLASH case officer, whose identity is protected, reveals that the operation aimed to instigate a coup by organizing a military group within Cuba, though the agency tried to de-emphasize assassination, which was central to AMLASH's plans. Discussions covered the case officer's interactions with AMLASH, AMLASH's concerns regarding the CIAâ€™s resolve, and his request to meet with someone high in the U.S. government, such as Robert Kennedy, to gain assurance of the operation's importance.",
