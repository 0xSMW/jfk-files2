  "security": "Sharing Edward Lansdale's critical views on the Bay of Pigs operation and his account of internal debates could reveal vulnerabilities in the decision-making processes of both the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Lansdale mentions Allen Dulles pleading with him not to 'spoil the plan' and his own skepticism, indicating potential discord and misjudgments at high levels. Quoting directly: 'Allen Dulles brought his planners to a policy group meeting, and they were explaining the concept and my questioning was such that Allen Dulles pleaded with me not to spoil the plan at an early stage.' and 'I was rather critical of the concept, and it was just too clumsy and overt, and a poor-planned feeling.' Disclosing these details could damage the reputation of key figures and the perceived competence of U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War.",
