  "summary_one_paragraph": "On June 9, 1975, a memorandum was created summarizing the May 21, 1975, testimony of retired FBI Special Agent Alan G. Sentinella before the Senate Select Committee (SSC) concerning FBI investigations of Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison. Sentinella's testimony, conducted primarily by Lester B. Seidel, covered topics such as the discontinuation of telephone surveillance at King's residence, the absence of direct surveillance on Levison in Atlanta, and the use of characterizations to denote alleged communist affiliations of Levison, O'Dell, Rustin, and Wachtel. The memo also recounts Sentinella's denial of involvement in efforts to disrupt Andrew Youngâ€™s political campaign and details the limited scope of surreptitious entries and electronic surveillance during his involvement.",
