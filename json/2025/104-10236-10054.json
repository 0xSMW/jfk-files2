  "summary_one_paragraph": "This SECRET message, dated October 3, 1962, from an unspecified CIA station (likely Kingston, Jamaica) addresses concerns regarding Cuban coverage from Jamaica. It responds to WAVE 9150 and KNGS Ã˜167, indicating the station chief (COS) questions the feasibility of an overt delegation led by AMBUD due to Jamaican government sensitivities about being used for counter-revolutionary activities against Cuba. Instead, the station suggests covert support through RUABBE and proposes assigning personnel under either non-official or official cover to manage Cuban, Haitian, and Dominican problems. The message also requests an additional secretary trained in communications and administration to handle increased reporting and productive liaison activities.",
