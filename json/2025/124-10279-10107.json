  "summary_one_paragraph": "On December 14, 1973, the CIA sent a teletype to the FBI's Intelligence Division concerning telephone taps on calls from the USA to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City made by an individual identifying himself as Morlando Serrano. Serrano used double-talk, spoke Spanish with the Cuban Vice Consul Juan Ensenat Camps (a Cuban Intelligence Officer), and referred to his relationship with Manuel Rodriguez Seoane in 1964 and to \"Mickey\" (Enrique Cicardlabrada). The CIA believes Serrano may be Emilio Echarte Pedroso, who was recruited in Cuba and dispatched to the USA to assassinate Cuban exile leader Manolo Ray and who contacted DGI Officer Cicard in Mexico in 1968. The CIA forwarded a tape recording of a November 15 telephone conversation obtained from the Mexican Service to FBI Headquarters for review, hoping the FBI can identify the caller and his activities.",
