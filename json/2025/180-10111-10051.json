Disclosing these methodologies and sources could compromise ongoing or future investigations. Specifically, the document states, 'The report, which Deneslya says came out of New York City, did not mention this defector by name. This, in itself, was not unusual because the Contact Division liked to conceal sources.'",

  "summary": "A summary of an interview conducted by HSCA investigator James P. Kelly with Donald Deneslya, a former CIA employee, regarding his experiences with Russian defector Golitsin and information he encountered related to Lee Harvey Oswald.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "On September 24, 1978, HSCA investigator James P. Kelly interviewed Donald Deneslya, a former CIA employee who worked as an Administrative Assistant for Russian defector Golitsin. Deneslya provided insights into Golitsinâ€™s defection, his knowledge of Western intelligence leaks, and his interactions with various CIA personnel. He also recounted an incident in November 1962 involving Rudolf Nureyev and a strange request from Golitsin. Deneslya recalled a report from July-August 1963 concerning an American re-defector, a Marine who had worked in Minsk, which he believes referred to Lee Harvey Oswald, also suggesting that the CIA conceals the origin of some reports to protect sources. Deneslya also authorized Kelly to inspect his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
