  "summary_one_paragraph": "In a Washington Post article by Timothy S. Robinson, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) admitted its involvement in the Glomar Explorer project, aimed at raising a sunken Russian submarine from the Pacific Ocean floor. This admission, filed in a U.S. Court of Appeals document by the Justice Department, reversed the government's earlier stance that even acknowledging CIA involvement could harm national security. The case, brought by the Military Audit Project, involved secret court proceedings, including a secret opinion from Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, reflecting concerns that disclosing details of the project could provoke retaliation against U.S. interests, as warned by Brent Scowcroft.",
