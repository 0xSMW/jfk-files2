In response, the South Vietnamese government (GVN) recalled diplomats from several countries, including Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, New Delhi, Djakarta, Tokyo, Rangoon, and Senegal, ostensibly for a seminar on the Strategic Hamlet Program, but actually to discuss the Buddhist situation and redefine its foreign policy following Lodge's appointment. The telegram indicates concerns within the GVN regarding U.S. influence and a desire to reassess its international stance.",
