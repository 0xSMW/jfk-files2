  "security": "This series of documents details CIA's interactions with and assessments of Manuel Ray, a Cuban exile leader, which reveals the agencyâ€™s methods for managing and evaluating assets. Disclosing these communications could expose the agency's criteria for support, internal debates about Ray's reliability, and the use of propaganda against him. Specifically, the document states that if Ray ever acquired political power, it \"would be as dangerous (or more so in the long run) to United States interests as Castro.\" Disclosing this information would undermine current operations and reveal the Agency's negative operational assessment.",
