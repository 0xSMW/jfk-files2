Also, revealing that interviews are conducted by an individual \"aware of the NOSENKO case since June 1962\" can potentially expose sources or methods used to handle defectors.",

  "summary_one_paragraph": "This memorandum, dated October 1, 1968, from the Deputy Chief of the Security Research Staff to the Director of Security, summarizes the investigation into Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko to determine if he was a bona fide defector or a KGB plant. The investigation included extensive interviews, polygraph examinations, and collaboration with the FBI and SB Division to analyze Nosenko's background, motivations, and the information he provided. The conclusion is that Nosenko is who he claims to be, held his claimed positions in the KGB, was not dispatched by the KGB, and that his previous lies and exaggerations are not currently of material significance.",
