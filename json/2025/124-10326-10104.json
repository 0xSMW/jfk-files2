  "summary_one_paragraph": "In a memorandum dated January 13, 1967, FBI agent D.J. Brennan, Jr. informs W.C. Sullivan that the separate control file (62-99724) created in 1953 for retaining copies of memoranda from James Angleton, Chief Counterintelligence Staff at the CIA, is no longer necessary. The memo explains that the control file was established to monitor Angleton's liaison with the FBI on matters not reported through normal CIA channels, including intelligence projects with the Israeli Intelligence Service, but since the information disseminated by Angleton is already filed in individual or organizational case files, the control file has become obsolete, leading to the recommendation that its maintenance be discontinued, though it will still be used for policy matters.",
