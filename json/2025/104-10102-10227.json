  "security": "This document contains information about a journalist, Tadeusz (Tad) Witold Szulc, suspected of being a hostile foreign agent, including details of his movements, contacts, and alleged anti-Agency activities. Disclosing these details could compromise intelligence-gathering methods, reveal sources of information, and potentially damage relationships with foreign intelligence services. Quoting directly: 'SZULC has been under suspicion as a hostile foreign agent since 1948 when the FBI reported (apparently from a British source) that he was a Communist... It also resulted in continuing watch of his movements and activities because they represented a threat to the cover of Agency personnel.'",

It outlines his early suspicion as a Communist in 1948, his frequent contacts with Communist Party leaders in Latin America, and his increasing anti-Agency activities in the 1970s, emphasizing that while no firm conclusions can be drawn, his actions, especially post-Watergate, have been detrimental to the CIA and U.S. image.",
