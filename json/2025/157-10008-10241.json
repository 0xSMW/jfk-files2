  "summary_one_paragraph": "On July 24, 1975, Paul Wallach and Joe DiGenova interviewed Bruce Cheever, former deputy director of Task Force W, at the Carroll Arms. The interview focused on Cheever's background, his role in Task Force W, and his understanding of the Mongoose operation aimed at removing the Castro regime in Cuba. Cheever stated that Task Force W was under the operational carte blanche of the White House, with explicit SGA approval required for each operation; he also described figures like Harvey as a compartmentalized operative and Lansdale as RFK's representative, ensuring the Kennedys were informed. Cheever attended meetings with designees of the SGA principals and noted that after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the urgency behind Cuban operations diminished.",
