  "security": "Disclosing operational details such as targeting individuals, establishing contact under false pretenses, and fabricating information to influence visa decisions could compromise ongoing operations, damage relationships with foreign governments, and undermine public trust. For instance, paragraph 2 states 'Contact was established with him in about August 1957 as a consequence of his non-immigrant visa application, and about six meetings have been held with him since that time, ostensibly for the purpose of fully clarifying his visa status.' Additionally, paragraph 3 mentions 'fabricated information mentioned in paragraph 2B of Attachment A is that reported in HKH-954, 5 January 1955, and HKH-943, 28 December 1954.' These actions, if revealed, could have serious repercussions.",
