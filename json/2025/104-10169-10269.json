  "summary_one_paragraph": "On December 23, a cable from Havana reports that Robert M. Geddes, working with AMPAN-22, contacted the CIA after failing to meet Ralph Diaz Hanscom, requesting the delivery of a special airdrop map to Miami for 'Clarence.' Geddes explained that an earlier map brought by Villalon was unsuitable, and the new map, prepared by engineer Crespo in Cienfuegos, had been passed to Geddes via Mario Bolang. The airdrop is specified for Limas, Ramirez, Montiel, and Duque, and is intended to deliver arms and ammunition for 423 men plus 100 pistols, with preliminary drop signals consisting of one red light, one white light, and one red light about 15 feet apart, with a clockwise movement indicating readiness to receive.",
