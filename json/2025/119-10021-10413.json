  "security": "The document details actions taken by the CIA and other U.S. government entities to counteract Cuban subversion in Latin America. Disclosing specific intelligence-gathering methods (such as surveillance of Cuban flights, clandestine collection of information), could harm ongoing operations and compromise relationships with foreign governments. Quoting directly, the document reveals activities such as 'Developed highly useful information on frequency of Cuban \"chartered\" flights to Brazil, names and nationalities of passengers and crew, and lax measures of control followed by Brazilian authorities' and 'Maintained close watch over travel to and from Cuba.' These details could allow hostile entities to deduce sources and methods, potentially undermining future intelligence efforts.",
