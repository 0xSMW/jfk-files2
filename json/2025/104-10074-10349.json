Releasing this information could reveal sensitive sources and methods used by the CIA and the FBI, potentially compromising intelligence gathering capabilities and endangering sources.

  "summary": "A memorandum from J. Haffner to J. D. Lavery, via A. Addona, concerning the classification of document EX 3600, providing justification for its classification and suggesting a FOIA exemption.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "In a memorandum dated April 7, 1977, J. Haffner, C/SCB/IP A.S., responds to J. D. Lavery's request for justification of the classification of document EX 3600. Haffner explains that, ex post facto, based on his understanding, any document produced by MHCHAOS would have been classified at least SECRET due to the operation's sensitivity. He argues that the document warrants continued classification at the CONFIDENTIAL level because it contains information acquired from sensitive sources/methods and references classified FBI reports. Haffner recommends FOIA exemption (b)(3) for EX 3600.",
