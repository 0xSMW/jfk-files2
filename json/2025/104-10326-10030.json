While the subject had no objection to the release of his name, such notifications and discussions about the release of information, could expose internal procedures. Specifically the line ‘SUBJECT WAS IMPRESSED AND GRATEFUL THAT TQHIGHROAD PROVIDED HIM WITH A HEADS UP ON THIS ISSUE’ reveals that TQHIGHROAD is involved in notifying individuals about the release of their information. This could highlight CIA involvement in shaping narratives overseas, potentially harming ongoing operations and damaging the CIA’s reputation.",
