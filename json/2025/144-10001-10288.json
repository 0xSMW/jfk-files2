They also explain that they were interested in names in traffic collected for foreign intelligence purposes. The memo further states that the NSAâ€™s total known role was an informal request from Mr. Dulles to review exhibits for secret writing or codes, with no findings, and that there is no identified information from Cuban or Soviet transmissions relating to the assassination, although Cuban military forces did go on alert immediately after the assassination.",
