  "summary_one_paragraph": "This SECRET telepouch, dated April 27, 1978, outlines a request from the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) for information pertaining to the Flemish Order of Militants (VMO) as part of their investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. The CIA is seeking to balance honoring the HSCA request with maintaining a confidential relationship with NIGALE, an intelligence entity that may possess relevant information on the VMO. The message requests that the Brussels station inquire with NIGALE about any contacts between the VMO and Americans during 1968-1970, their willingness to prepare a report for the committee, and permission to share VMO excerpts from semi-annual reviews, sourced or unsourced.",
