  "summary_one_paragraph": "On April 10, 1963, the FBI sent a memo to the CIA regarding Franc Pecar, a Yugoslavian commercial representative believed to be returning to Yugoslavia at the end of April. The CIA expressed interest in contacting Pecar to persuade him to return under CIA control, due to conflicting information about whether he was a member of the Yugoslav Intelligence Service (YIS). However, the FBI advised against approaching Pecar based on information from New York informants indicating he was not engaged in intelligence activities and a recent denial by the State Department for a similar approach.",
