The document's status is 'Postponed in Part' due to privacy concerns, with two postponements related to the redaction of Social Security Numbers (SSN). The Board's decision balances the historical interest in the document against potential harm to individuals, concluding that releasing SSNs would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. The redacted text is replaced with 'SSN,' and the next review date is set for 2017.",
