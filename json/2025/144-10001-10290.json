  "security": "This document records operational responses and communications following President Kennedy's assassination. Sharing specific communications protocols (e.g., releasing 'P055/251' and 'P055/252') and unit readiness conditions ('SIGINT READINESS ALFA') could reveal NSA's operational procedures and response mechanisms, potentially compromising future operations. Details about specific unit activities, such as revising mission coverage at USN-19 due to a possible coup in Brazil, may also expose sensitive intelligence gathering activities. Sharing the specific alert conditions could indicate the nature of potential Soviet responses. The statement, 'INSTRUCTED THEM NOT TO DECLARE ANY READINESS CONDITION,' reveals potential internal disagreement regarding security protocols following the assassination.",
