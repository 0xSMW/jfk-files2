  "summary_one_paragraph": "This TOP SECRET UMBRA cable, dated December 6, 1963, relays a report from Prague regarding the reactions to President John F. Kennedy's assassination. The cable notes that while the general population in Prague expressed grief and anxiety, with large crowds gathering at the American Embassy and signing a memorial book, the government showed minimal interest, as evidenced by the limited attendance of officials at memorial services and the absence of flags at half-mast on official buildings. The press, however, characterized the assassination as a crime against world peace, expressing concern that the new American administration might shift policies under right-wing influence.",
