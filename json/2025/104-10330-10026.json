Releasing information regarding the Congo and Senegal would jeopardize relationships. The Czech citizenry came of age in an atmosphere in which distrust of intelligence services in general, and the CIA in particular, was thoroughly ingrained. That distrust lingers in the public's mind even today. Disclosure to the public of our presence weakens this confidence.",

  "summary_one_paragraph": "In a memorandum dated May 7, 1995, CIA Deputy Director for Operations David Cohen expresses strong opposition to the JFK Assassination Records Review Board's potential release of documents identifying CIA station locations. Cohen argues that public acknowledgment would embarrass host governments, threaten sensitive operations, and jeopardize liaison relationships, specifically highlighting concerns regarding stations in the Congo (Zaire), Senegal, Prague, India, Tunisia, and Morocco. He suggests using regional designations instead of specific station names, warning that any disclosure of operational presence weakens confidence in the CIA's ability to protect sources and methods.",
