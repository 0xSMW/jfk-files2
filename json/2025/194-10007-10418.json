Trinkala requested an interview because he was underage when he enlisted in the Army, claiming he was only 17 years old; his records incorrectly indicated he was born on November 28, 1950, while his real birthday was November 28, 1951.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "On November 7, 1969, Victor L. Trinkala, a Private (PVT) with social security number 186-42-1155, submitted a Record of Interview form because he was underage at enlistment, stating he was actually 17 years old. Assigned to AUTH RVN with roster number 7 V4 L-25, Trinkala reported his real birthday as November 28, 1951, contradicting his official records that listed November 28, 1950. The interviewer put Trinkala on hold and planned to call the County Clerk to verify his birth record, as noted on April 22, 1970, by Dave Nav of the 115th MI Group, Alameda Field Office, Region I.",
