Paniello in Havana, Cuba. The wedding, scheduled for June 1959, was reportedly opposed by Trafficante due to Paniello's prior divorce. An informant, MM-416-C, suggested the Havana location was chosen to avoid publicity and Trafficante's presence in Tampa. The memo suggests the event might draw Trafficante's associates, including individuals with underworld ties, and is being forwarded to the Legat in Havana for awareness.",
