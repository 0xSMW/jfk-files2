Specifically, the cable requests that addressees 'make every effort determine if Galt is or has been in your area' and pass this information to 'liaison and any other likely sources.' This could indicate intelligence sharing arrangements that some countries might prefer to keep confidential.",

  "summary_one_paragraph": "This memorandum, dated October 24, 1975, addresses the CIA's involvement in the James Earl Ray case, clarifying that all CIA activities were conducted at the behest of the FBI. Dick Ober recalls coordinating with the FBI, primarily via phone due to the rapidly evolving situation. The memo references a cable concerning Eric Starvo Galt (an alias of Ray), instructing overseas stations to determine if Galt had been in their area, to share information with liaison contacts, and to report findings back to headquarters and legal attach√©s; Ober notes the FBI later provided fingerprint formulas, physical descriptions, and photos to aid in this effort. David H. Blee, Associate Deputy Director for Operations, transmits this memo to the Director of Central Intelligence.",
