  "summary_one_paragraph": "This agent report, dated November 14, 1969, outlines information received by Duty Agent Mario J. Maltese of the 108th Military Intelligence Group from an anonymous male caller. The caller, claiming to be a former Counterintelligence Corp Special Agent, reported that PVT Victor L. TRINKALA, a soldier identified as a Conscientious Objector en route to Vietnam via Oakland Army Terminal, was unknowingly contacted by a \"Soviet Agent.\" The \"Soviet Agent\" allegedly intended to exploit TRINKALA's CO status for anti-U.S. propaganda, suggesting the Army was forcing a known objector to serve in a combat zone against his will. The caller requested that TRINKALA's orders be cancelled or that he be detained to prevent potential embarrassment to the U.S., claiming he would inform \"proper\" authorities in Washington, DC, about the incident and citing his release from East Germany approximately one year prior.",
