  "security": "This memorandum details the complaints and concerns of Dr. Miro regarding the operations of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) and its relationship with the CIA. Specifically, it notes Miro’s frustration with the Agency’s independent actions, lack of support for the Council’s initiatives, and the potential for compromising the security of operations and personnel in Cuba. Directly quoting, “Meanwhile the Agency keeps on infiltrating people into Cuba but disconnected from the Council. I was told in my conversation with the President to amplify the membership in the Consejo...This puts it into an absurd position - merely a 'council painted on the wall.' I have said, 'look for someone else if I am not considered able to do the job - but we must work. I have confidence in the Agency, but I cannot work in this fashion.'”, “He said he was convinced that there was no intention of accepting such plans, and that while now we discuss such plans, we lose out. I cannot accept this situation, nor would you.” Revealing Miro's concerns about security could expose the operational vulnerabilities and internal conflicts within the anti-Castro efforts.",

  "summary": "A memorandum documenting a meeting with Dr. Miro, head of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), where he expresses frustration over the lack of support and coordination from the CIA, the independent operations of the Agency in Cuba, and the failure to resolve key issues such as providing arms, funds, and a unified plan of action for the underground resistance.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "On October 16, 1961, Dr. Miro met with an unnamed agent to discuss the dire state of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC). Miro lamented the lack of unified action and support from the CIA, highlighting that the agency continues to act independently, undermining the CRC's authority and effectiveness. He expressed frustration over the failure to provide arms and funds for the underground resistance, as well as his inability to implement a cohesive plan of action. Furthermore, Miro voiced concerns that the Agency’s direct dealings with other Cuban groups were marginalizing the Council and jeopardizing the security of operations in Cuba. Ultimately, Miro threatened to resign if the issues were not addressed, citing his desire to avoid being a puppet leader and to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the anti-Castro efforts.",
