  "summary_one_paragraph": "Based on Polish diplomatic communications intercepted by the NSA, this December 2, 1963, TOP SECRET UMBRA report outlines Cuba's reaction to President Kennedy's assassination. The Cuban leadership, according to a November 24 report from CIURUS in Havana, perceives the situation as serious, fearing that the search for Kennedy’s murderers will implicate Castroites, Communists, and USSR influence. They anticipate a shift in U.S. foreign and domestic policy due to the loss of Kennedy’s authority and modernistic leanings, suggesting ultrareactionary circles within the U.S. may have been involved in the assassination to strengthen conservative elements in Latin America. In response, Cuba declared a quiet military alert and began relocating military units.",
