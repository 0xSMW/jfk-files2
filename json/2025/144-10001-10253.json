Christensenâ€™s allegations about involvement in President Kennedy's assassination; the interview, held in secure spaces provided by George Murphy, involved Sgt. Nicholas B. Stevenson, who was stationed with Christensen at USA-55, Kirknewton, Scotland, in 1963, and focused on Christensen's letter to Stevenson written in May 1978, with Stevenson denying knowledge of any intercepted communications related to the assassination; the staffers were interested in identifying the individual Christensen believed related to the assassination, and considered having Stevenson contact Christensen, a suggestion met with resistance and requiring policy-level examination within the DoD.",
