  "security": "Sharing the transcript of the Senate Select Committee hearing, particularly Director Kelley’s statements, could reveal the FBI’s operational concerns and adjustments made in response to congressional oversight. Disclosing these internal assessments and proposed reforms may undermine ongoing intelligence efforts and allow adversaries to anticipate and counteract future FBI strategies. Quoting directly: “Probably the most important question here today is what assurances I can give that the errors and abuses which arose under the Counterintelligence Programs will not occur again?” Also, “Today we place a high premium on openness, openness both within and without the service.” These statements open the FBI to scrutiny regarding its adherence to these assurances.",
