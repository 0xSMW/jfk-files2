  "security": "This document discusses the ARRB's (Assassination Records Review Board) objective to assure the public that all JFK assassination-related files have been located. It also mentions specific offices and files within the CIA that the ARRB wants to search, including DCI files, Richard Helms' files, and DO offices. Providing details on which files the ARRB is interested in could compromise internal CIA processes and reveal search methodologies. For example: \"Gunn asked if he can go to WTC and/or other Records Centers and look at shelf lists and the files around a topic of special interest?\"",
