  "security": "This document is marked Top Secret and includes specific intelligence on various countries and regions. Disclosing details about military and political situations, such as troop movements, political instability, and potential coup plots (e.g., in Brazil), could compromise intelligence sources and methods. It also reveals information about intercepts, which could expose signals intelligence capabilities. The document also includes notes on Chou En-Lai's tour of Africa, an effort by The Guinean ambassador to promote diplomacy in Peiping, President Sukarno's plans to head to Manila, terrorist attacks on U.S.-owned oil and gas pipelines in Venezuela, and the departure of members of the Soviet Embassy, all of which could jeopardize diplomatic relations and operational effectiveness. Directly quoting: \"We are now reasonably sure that at least 784 persons infiltrated from the north during 1963 and the actual total may be much higher.\"",
