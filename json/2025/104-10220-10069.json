The polygraph results, investigative reports, and operational approvals contain sensitive information about intelligence sources, methods, and ongoing investigations, which, if revealed, could compromise operations and endanger individuals. For instance, the file includes information about 'infiltration of CRASH,' which details operational methods. Disclosing the true name and cryptonym association of WKSCARLET/3 could expose an intelligence asset.
