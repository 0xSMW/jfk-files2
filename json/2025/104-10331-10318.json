  "security": "Acknowledging the existence of specific CIA stations could compromise relationships with host governments and their intelligence services. As stated in the document, doing so could \"open up old sores\" and affect trust between the Agency and the host service (violated agreement of confidentially). Releasing crypts and file numbers can also cause damage, as exemplified by the Iranian takeover.",

  "summary": "Notes from an ARRB staff briefing on October 11, 1995, detailing CIA concerns about releasing information on overseas stations, potential political repercussions, and the balance between public interest and agency needs. CIA representatives discuss the impact of acknowledging station presence in 1963 on current operations, emphasizing the importance of protecting sensitive relationships and ongoing projects.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "During an ARRB staff briefing on October 11, 1995, CIA representatives Bill McNair, Lee Carle, John Goins, Chuck Briggs, Hal Bean, and Barry Harrelson discussed concerns related to releasing information about CIA stations. The primary issue was the potential political fallout of acknowledging station locations, which could strain relationships with host governments and intelligence services, particularly in countries where the government does not acknowledge its own service. The CIA representatives argued for protecting stations not critical to the Oswald story and expressed reservations about releasing sensitive information that could jeopardize ongoing operations, such as counter-narcotics projects and covert actions.",
