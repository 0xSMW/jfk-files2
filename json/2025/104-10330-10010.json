  "summary_one_paragraph": "This memo, dated May 15, 1995, is from John Pereira of the CIA/Historical Review Group, to David Marwell, Executive Director of the ARRB, concerning the sensitivity of records related to telephone tap operations in Mexico City. Pereira explains that the Directorate of Operations has prepared a statement outlining why references to the Mexico City Station teltap activity should be excised from documents released under the JFK Assassination Record Collection Act of 1992. The memo asserts that the joint teltap operation with Mexican liaison, though initiated over thirty years prior, continues in a modified form, and any official USG acknowledgment of its existence would seriously compromise current operations by damaging relations with the Mexican liaison service.",
