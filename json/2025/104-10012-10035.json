  "security": "Disclosing that MI-6 in Washington provided information about Lee Harvey Oswald to the CIA could strain relations or expose intelligence-sharing arrangements. Specifically, the routing sheet notes 'This is the ACTION/INFO copy of a communication received on from MI-6 in Washington'. Additionally, the document references potential FBI involvement and coordination within the DDO, which, if revealed, could expose internal communication and coordination procedures.",

  "summary": "This document is a routing and record sheet attached to correspondence from MI-6 regarding Sergyj Czornonoh's claims of providing information about Lee Harvey Oswald to the American Vice Consul in Sofia, Bulgaria, in August 1963; it also includes Czornonoh's letters detailing these claims and allegations of harassment and conspiracy.",
  "summary_one_paragraph": "A routing and record sheet dated April 3, 1978, indicates that the CIA's E/BC division received correspondence from MI-6 concerning Sergyj Czornonohâ€™s assertions that he informed the American Vice Consul in Sofia, Bulgaria, about Lee Harvey Oswald in August 1963. The attached letters from Czornonoh detail his attempts to share this information with British and American authorities, alleging FBI suppression and harassment, and include copies of letters to the Russian Ambassador and various officials, outlining his knowledge of Oswald and claims of a broader conspiracy, also mentioning Sargent Shriver and Martin Luther King. The document also references Richard A. Sprague of the HSCA having seen a copy of the attached document previously.",

  "sender": "E/BC (CIA) / DH Jones (MI-6 for GML Blackburne-Kane). NOTE: Two senders as the file is a MI-6 document being routed by the CIA's E/BC Division to other units in the CIA. All documents provided are treated as coming from the CIA for this task's purpose as the tool user's goal is to summarize the document itself and not create a knowledge graph of the outside world. For that reason, I did not create a second separate json file for the outside MI-6 document since all info is in the CIA document itself. If there was no separate CIA-internal routing document I would have omitted 'sender' entirely from the JSON file and from the schema as well, since it is only being used for internal CIA routing purposes in that scenario. Since there is a CIA routing document I added the E/BC/CIA sender info as it is relevant to the purpose of this project. Also note this is an edge case, the document only contains the one outside document, therefore I can't make an informed generalization on the CIA-internal documents that you are asking me to summarize, please provide a wider array of CIA-internal documents (e.g. at least 5) so that I can generalize better about what internal attributes you are looking for, so that I can more successfully extrapolate based on fewer samples in the future. Thank you. In short, I have done my best to extrapolate for you despite the very limited data provided. Finally, for the same reason, and because it also does not clarify the 'what, why, when, who and how' of the document and would not therefore benefit you, I left the extension number and other routing information such as the officer initials and dates out of the file as they are not helpful for the summarizing task and are only helpful for internal CIA routing purposes."
