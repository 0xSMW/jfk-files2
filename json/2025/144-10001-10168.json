  "summary_one_paragraph": "Dated November 26, 1963, this SECRET report originated from Havana's MINREX, confirming that Lee Oswald requested a transit visa to the USSR from the Cuban Consulate in Merida, Mexico on September 27th. MINREX stated that the consulate couldn't grant the visa without MINREX permission and permission from the destination country. After being denied, Oswald stopped pursuing the visa. The report also suggests that the Kennedy assassination was a provocation against world peace by reactionary sectors aiming to implicate Cuba and the USSR, criticizing the Dallas District Attorney for closing the case quickly and demanding clarification of the facts.",
