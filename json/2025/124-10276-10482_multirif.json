  "security": "Releasing details about the surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison could expose sensitive investigative techniques, informants, and operational details used by the FBI during the 1960s. Discussing the alleged CP connections of individuals associated with King may also be deemed controversial. Sharing the extent to which the FBI investigated Kingâ€™s associates or suggesting that the FBI was unresponsive to civil rights complications could damage its reputation.",
