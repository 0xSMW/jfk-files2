  "summary": "The Office of Legislative Counsel was a part of the CIA responsible for liaising with Congress. The documents indicate their involvement in administrative tasks, budget discussions, and acting as a point of contact between the CIA and various congressional committees, particularly the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. They handled employment requests, security matters, and the review of intelligence materials. The timeline spans from February 1977 to December 1978, with consistent engagement with the HSCA. A notable pattern is their role in facilitating communication and information flow between the CIA and congressional bodies investigating the JFK assassination, handling sensitive materials, and addressing security concerns related to these investigations.",
