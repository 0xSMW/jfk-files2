The FBI investigated Gabriel Mannarino's plans to purchase or lease the Anchorage Road House in anticipation of an administration change and move his gambling operation there. The FBI also investigated Gabriel Mannarino's suspected gambling activities at a farm in Westmoreland County, PA. Willie Sams, associated with Gabriel Mannarino's gambling operations, may have a tipster or be an informant for a federal agency. Gambling activities in New Kensington, PA, were suppressed due to increased law enforcement pressure, including an IRS investigation into Willie Sams, a key figure in Gabriel and Samuel Mannarino's gambling operations.",
