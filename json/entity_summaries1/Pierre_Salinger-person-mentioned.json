One document mentions the U.S. government's reaction to interviews with John F. Kennedy and Fidel Castro, suggesting Salinger, as a member of the administration, would have been privy to these reactions. The documents do not provide a timeline of Salinger's specific actions or a pattern of involvement directly related to the assassination, but rather indicate his presence within the Kennedy administration during relevant periods.",
