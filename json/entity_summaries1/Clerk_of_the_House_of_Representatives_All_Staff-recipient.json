  "summary": "The documents primarily concern the payroll records of staff members of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The Clerk of the House of Representatives, All Staff, is implicitly involved as the recipient of payroll authorizations and related documentation for HSCA staff. The documents detail the employment of various individuals, including Lance W. Svendsen, Dawne C. Miller, Peter G. Beeson, Clarence J. Day, Margo E. Jackson, and Dan L. Hardway. The records include information about their salaries, positions, and employment dates. A recurring theme is the postponement of the release of Social Security numbers from these records to protect personal privacy, as determined by the Assassination Records Review Board. The documents span from 1977 to 1995, reflecting the period of HSCA's operation and subsequent review of its records.",
