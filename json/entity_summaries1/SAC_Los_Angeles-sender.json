  "summary": "The SAC (Special Agent in Charge) of the FBI's Los Angeles office was a sender of multiple reports concerning John Rosselli's activities in the early 1960s. These reports, primarily teletypes and airtels, detail Rosselli's whereabouts, associates, and financial transactions. The SAC, Los Angeles, communicated this information to the Director of the FBI and, in some instances, to the SAC in Las Vegas. The documents suggest a focus on monitoring Rosselli's movements and connections, including those in Las Vegas and San Diego, as well as his financial dealings. The reports span from October 1962 to September 1963.",
