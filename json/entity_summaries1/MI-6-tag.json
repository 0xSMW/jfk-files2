  "summary": "MI-6, British Intelligence, appears in these documents primarily in the context of information sharing with US intelligence agencies like the CIA and FBI. Their role involves providing information related to individuals and events potentially connected to the JFK assassination or related matters. This includes reporting on individuals with possible links to Cuba, such as Levi Laub's unauthorized travel, and relaying information about Sergyj Czornonoh's claims regarding Lee Harvey Oswald. They also shared information regarding a conversation about the Kennedy assassination involving a Cuban Embassy counselor in London. The timeline spans from 1961 to 1964, indicating ongoing intelligence gathering and collaboration during this period. A notable pattern is their role as an intermediary, passing on information gathered from other sources (e.g., British newspaperman, Sergyj Czornonoh) to US agencies.",
