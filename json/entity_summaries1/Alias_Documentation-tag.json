  "summary": "Alias documentation refers to the creation and management of false identities and supporting documents (such as driver's licenses, social security cards, and identity cards) used by individuals, particularly CIA operatives, for covert operations. In the context of the JFK assassination records, alias documentation is a sensitive topic due to its potential to reveal covert actions, intelligence collection methods, and the identities of individuals involved in clandestine activities. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) negotiated with the CIA regarding the release of documents related to alias documentation, balancing the public interest in transparency with the need to protect sensitive information that could potentially harm diplomatic relations, ongoing litigation, or intelligence operations. The documents span from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, indicating a sustained concern over the protection and potential release of this type of information.",
