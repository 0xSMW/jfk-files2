These communications are crucial for relaying intelligence, coordinating operations, and managing resources.

Specific examples include communications regarding supplies and shipments (JMWAVE cable), intelligence gathering and potential military preparations in Cuba (NYJAT TYPIC AXKHAN-2 COMMO TARROT), contact information for agents like Rolando CUBELA Secades (AM/LASH), and operational details including planned retrieval of materials and possible agent exfiltration (Classified Message). The documents reveal the importance of secure communication channels, code names, and contact addresses for maintaining operational security and effectiveness.",
