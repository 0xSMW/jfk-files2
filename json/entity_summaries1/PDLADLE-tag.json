  "summary": "PDLADLE appears to be a high-level defector who was of interest to the CIA. Queries were made about them, and there were considerations for an outside lawyer to draw up a Deed of Trust for them, indicating a level of protection or management of their assets. PDLADLE was considered for questioning regarding the Wallenberg case, although it hadn't occurred as of 1976. There was also a directive to prevent the publication of PDLADLE's material in BKHERALD due to liaison equities and the source's un-surfaced status. A meeting in New York involved PDLADLE and his wife mortgaging property in favor of a CIA-devised facility nominee, Roush-Walker Company, indicating CIA involvement in managing their financial affairs.",
