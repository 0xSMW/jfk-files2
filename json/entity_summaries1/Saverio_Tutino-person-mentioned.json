  "summary": "Saverio Tutino is mentioned in three documents related to Cuban matters. The documents primarily focus on the activities of an agent named DELORRY in Italy and Cuba. While Tutino himself is not directly involved in the activities described, the documents suggest that DELORRY had connections to individuals of interest, including those close to Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. One document mentions Manuel Pineiro Lozada expressing interest in meeting and traveling with Delorry, suggesting potential intelligence connections. The documents span from 1965 to 1967, indicating a period of interest in DELORRY's activities and connections.",

However, the documents do not explicitly link Tutino or DELORRY to the assassination itself.",
