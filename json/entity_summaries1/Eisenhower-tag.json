  "summary": "Dwight D. Eisenhower was the President of the United States during the period when several covert operations and assassination plots were allegedly considered or planned by the CIA. The documents suggest that during his presidency, discussions and plans were made regarding the potential assassinations of foreign leaders such as Rafael Trujillo, Fidel Castro, and Patrice Lumumba. Specifically, one document mentions an alleged authorization from President Eisenhower regarding the Lumumba assassination plan in the Congo during 1960-1961. The documents raise questions about the extent of Eisenhower's knowledge and authorization of these plans, as well as the command and control system for covert actions during his administration. However, the documents do not directly link Eisenhower to the JFK assassination.",
