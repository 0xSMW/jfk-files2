  "summary": "Evelio Duque Miyar is a former Cuban citizen and anti-communist who was of interest to the CIA. Cables from 1978 indicate that the CIA had past interactions with him, including providing assistance, but terminated the relationship due to disagreements over operational control. In 1978, Duque Miyar opened a confectionery store across from the U.S. consulate in Guayaquil, Ecuador, prompting the Guayaquil station to request traces on him, suspecting possible involvement in Cuban operations in the Miami area during the early 1960s. The station also sought to determine if he had past ties to the U.S. government, though they stated they had no operational interest in him at that time. HQ was requested to conduct traces on him.",
