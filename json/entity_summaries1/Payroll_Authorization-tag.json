  "summary": "Payroll Authorization forms are administrative documents used by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) to authorize and record the payment of salaries to its staff. These forms typically include information such as the employee's name, position, salary, employment dates, and authorizing signatures. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) reviewed these payroll records and often postponed the release of Social Security numbers to protect personal privacy. The documents reveal details about the individuals employed by the HSCA, their roles within the committee (including the Martin Luther King Task Force and the John F. Kennedy Task Force), and their compensation. The records also include certifications regarding relationships to members of Congress and other administrative details related to their employment. The date range of these documents spans primarily from 1976 to 1978, with some documents including final determination notifications from the ARRB in 1995.",

  "significance": "Payroll Authorization forms provide insight into the staffing and operations of the HSCA, the individuals involved in the investigation, and the administrative processes surrounding their employment. They also highlight the ARRB's role in reviewing and potentially redacting sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers, from these records to protect personal privacy while still making the records available for historical research.",
