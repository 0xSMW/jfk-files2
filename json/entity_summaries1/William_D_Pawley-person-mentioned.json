Pawley expressed skepticism about the feasibility of supporting Cuban revolutionary activities due to disunity among anti-Castro groups and Castro's control. Additionally, Pawley had business interests in the Dominican Republic, including mineral exploitation and a postage stamp concession managed by his brother, Edward F. Pawley. The CIA was monitoring Pawley's activities and interests in the Dominican Republic.",
