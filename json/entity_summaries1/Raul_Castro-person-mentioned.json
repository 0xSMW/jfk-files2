  "summary": "Raul Castro is mentioned in three documents. One document from August 1957 refers to potential contacts within Castro's regime. Another document from May 1964 details a CIA project (AMCANOE) supporting Cuban resistance groups to overthrow CASTRO, revealing connections between Cuban exiles, the Mafia, and potential assassination plots against Cuban leaders. The documents suggest that Raul Castro was a significant figure in the Cuban government during the period when the CIA was actively involved in efforts to destabilize the regime.",

  "significance": "Raul Castro's significance in the JFK assassination context stems from his role as a leader in the Cuban government, which was a target of CIA covert operations. The documents suggest that the CIA was actively involved in efforts to overthrow the Castro regime, including potential assassination plots. This context is relevant to the JFK assassination because some theories suggest that the assassination was a result of retaliation for these covert operations.",
