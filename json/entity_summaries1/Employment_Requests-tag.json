  "summary": "The documents indicate that the Office of Legislative Counsel was involved in handling employment requests. These requests appear to be a routine part of the office's activities, alongside liaison with congressional offices and committees, and security matters. The documents do not provide specific details about the nature of these employment requests, such as who made them or what positions were being sought. The requests are mentioned in the context of daily activities and do not appear to be directly related to the JFK assassination investigation itself, but rather represent the administrative tasks handled by the Office of Legislative Counsel during that period.",
