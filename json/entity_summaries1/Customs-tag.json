  "summary": "The documents highlight instances where customs agencies play a role in potentially illicit activities. One document mentions a failed attempt to move items through Mexican customs, leading to increased scrutiny. Another refers to the return of Cuban exiles to the U.S., involving transportation and equipment, implying customs procedures at Andrews Air Force Base. A third document mentions a potential illegal arms shipment to the Caribbean. These instances suggest that customs agencies, while not directly implicated in the JFK assassination, are relevant in the context of potential illegal activities and movements of people and goods that could be related to broader conspiracies or operations.",
