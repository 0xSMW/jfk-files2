  "summary": "The documents reference addresses primarily in the context of contact information for individuals, many of whom are current or former CIA employees. These addresses are included in lists, memoranda, and contact books. The documents do not explicitly link the addresses to the JFK assassination but rather use them as part of personnel records and contact information. The addresses appear in lists alongside names and phone numbers, suggesting they are used for communication and identification purposes within the CIA. The documents span from lists of contact information to memoranda regarding CIA personnel and their interactions with the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA).",

  "significance": "The addresses themselves do not have direct significance to the JFK assassination in the context of these documents. Their importance lies in their association with CIA personnel, some of whom may have been interviewed by the HSCA. The addresses serve as a component of identifying and contacting individuals related to the CIA, which is relevant to understanding the broader context of investigations and information gathering related to the assassination.",
