  "summary": "The Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO), or Flemish Order of Militants, is a Flemish militant organization that garnered the attention of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) during its investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1978. The HSCA requested information on the VMO, specifically regarding any contacts between VMO members and American citizens between 1968 and 1970. However, NIGALE, an intelligence source, was reluctant to provide this information due to concerns about potential leaks and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The documents suggest a reluctance to share information with the HSCA, balancing the committee's request with preserving the relationship with NIGALE. The documents indicate that NIGALE did not have much information on VMO-American citizen contacts during the specified period.",

The documents focus on the reluctance of an intelligence source to share information about the VMO with the HSCA due to concerns about leaks and FOIA.",
