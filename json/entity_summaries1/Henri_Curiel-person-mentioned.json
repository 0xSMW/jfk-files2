  "summary": "Henri Curiel is mentioned in the documents as providing support to Black Panther members in Paris. Specifically, his organization is reported to be assisting members, including George Edward Wright, who arrived from Algiers, in obtaining plastic surgery and false documentation to re-enter the U.S. This activity occurred around 1973. The documents also mention the movements of American Black militants/hijackers from Algeria to France and Switzerland, suggesting Curiel's potential involvement in facilitating their travel. One document also mentions alleged connections between the CIA, Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation, and individuals linked to Soviet agents, although Curiel's direct involvement in this context is not explicitly stated.",
