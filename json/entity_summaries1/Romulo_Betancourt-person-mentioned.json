  "summary": "Romulo Betancourt is mentioned in the documents in the context of Cuban support for subversive activities, particularly in Venezuela. While the documents do not provide extensive details about Betancourt himself, they suggest that he was a significant figure in Venezuelan politics during the early 1960s, as evidenced by Cuba's involvement in supporting subversive activities against his government. His role appears to be that of a leader or figure targeted by Cuban-backed subversion. The documents do not specify the exact nature of Betancourt's position or his direct involvement in events related to the JFK assassination, but his government was a target of Cuban activities during the period surrounding the assassination.",
