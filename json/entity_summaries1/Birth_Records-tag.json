  "summary": "The documents highlight the use of birth records in investigations, specifically to verify identities and uncover potential discrepancies or name changes. In the context of Manuel Marti, birth records were examined to reveal a name change from Manuel Adrian Sotomayor-Badillo and to document his father's name change. Similarly, birth records were checked in Italy for Vincenzo Roselli and his family, but no records were found. These investigations suggest that birth records were a tool used to investigate individuals of interest, potentially to uncover hidden connections or inconsistencies in their backgrounds.",
