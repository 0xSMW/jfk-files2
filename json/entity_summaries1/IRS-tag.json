  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, the IRS's significance is indirect. The documents suggest the IRS was involved in investigating individuals potentially connected to organized crime, such as John Roselli. While these investigations might not be directly related to the assassination, they reflect the broader landscape of law enforcement activities and potential connections between individuals of interest during that period. The IRS's role was primarily investigatory, focusing on financial aspects of individuals who may have been of interest to other investigations.",
