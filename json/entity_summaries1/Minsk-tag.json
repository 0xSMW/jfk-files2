  "summary": "Minsk's significance in these documents primarily revolves around Lee Harvey Oswald's time living there in the Soviet Union. The documents reflect CIA interest in accessing Belorussian KGB (BKGB) records related to Oswald's life in Minsk, particularly in the context of the JFK assassination investigation and the work of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB). The CIA station in Minsk was tasked with facilitating meetings between the ARRB and BKGB, though CIA participation in substantive discussions was explicitly forbidden. There are concerns about the security and potential unauthorized access to Oswald's files by researchers, such as Norman Mailer. Beyond the Oswald connection, Minsk is also mentioned in the context of general CIA station activities, including liaison operations, embassy support, and intelligence gathering on Soviet life, including KGB activities and recruitment tactics. The documents span from the 1970s to the late 1990s, indicating a sustained interest in Minsk-related information concerning Oswald and broader Soviet intelligence matters.",
