  "summary": "J. D. Lavery is identified as being part of the Office of General Counsel (OGC). The documents available indicate Lavery's involvement in the classification of document EX 3600. These documents, dated April 7, 1977, are memoranda discussing the justification for classifying EX 3600, citing its connection to Operation MHCHAOS, the inclusion of information from sensitive sources and methods, and classified FBI reports. Lavery received these memoranda from P. Haefner and J. Haffner, both routed via A. Addona. The documents suggest Lavery's role involved reviewing and possibly approving the classification status of sensitive documents related to past CIA operations.",
