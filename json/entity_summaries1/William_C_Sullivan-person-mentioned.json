  "summary": "William C. Sullivan is mentioned in several memoranda related to the FBI's response to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) requests for information. These requests primarily concern materials related to Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The documents detail the FBI's efforts to locate and provide the requested materials to the SSC. Sullivan's role appears to be connected to the FBI's internal processes for handling and delivering sensitive information to the Senate committee, specifically concerning investigations and surveillance activities related to King and the SCLC. The documents do not explicitly detail Sullivan's direct involvement in the JFK assassination context, but rather his role in the FBI's response to subsequent inquiries regarding intelligence activities.",
