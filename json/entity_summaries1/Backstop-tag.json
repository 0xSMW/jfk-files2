The documents span from 1961 to 1975, indicating a sustained practice of using cover identities within military or intelligence operations. The notifications outline the administrative processes involved, such as submitting forms, changing limitation categories, and transferring cover responsibility. The documents suggest a systemized approach to creating and dismantling cover identities, with specific protocols for handling associated records and documentation.",
