In 1963, AMWHIP/1 had close ties to the Perumen regime and was considered for use in supporting operations in Rome, including providing cover and access to Perumen officials. In 1964, AMWHIP/1 was scheduled for a three-week business trip to Europe, with assignments in Paris and Geneva for KUBARK, and was expected to contact the Rome station. The documents suggest AMWHIP/1 was involved in sensitive operations and had established communication methods, as indicated by a memo detailing communication methods for Rolando CUBELA Secades (AM/LASH).",
