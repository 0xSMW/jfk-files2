  "summary": "The documents highlight instances of name changes, primarily focusing on Manuel Marti and his father, Adrian Sotomayor. Adrian Sotomayor legally changed his name to Manuel Marti in 1963, which also resulted in corrections to the birth certificates of his sons, Ivan and Manuel, to reflect the Marti surname. This name change is significant as FBI checks conducted later in 1968 found no records under Manuel Marti's name or his alias, Manuel Adrian Sotomayor-Badillo, indicating the importance of tracking individuals under both their original and new identities. Another instance involves EMMA HARRIS, who became known as EXMA HARRIS JOHNSON, prompting an inquiry regarding the validity of her Protective Security Approval (PCSA) due to negative traces under her new name.",
