  "summary": "A 201 file is a record maintained by the CIA on individuals of interest. These files contain personal information, activities, and any relevant intelligence gathered about the subject. The documents suggest that 201 files were used to track potential agents, collaborators, and persons of interest in various operations. The files include details such as health records, financial matters, and activities related to specific operations. The process of opening, maintaining, and consolidating these files was governed by specific criteria and procedures within the CIA. The documents also reveal that external entities, such as the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), requested information related to the criteria for opening 201 files and specific files related to the JFK assassination.",

  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, 201 files are significant because they potentially contain information about individuals who may have been involved or connected to the assassination. The ARRB requested information on Lee Harvey Oswald's pre-assassination files, indicating the importance of these records in understanding potential connections or intelligence failures related to the assassination. One document specifically mentions a 201 file of a protectable source related to the JFK assassination, with release postponed until the subject's death, highlighting the sensitivity and potential relevance of these files to the historical event.",
