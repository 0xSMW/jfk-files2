  "summary": "NWBOLTON is an individual or entity whose name appears in several CIA documents related to the JFK assassination. The documents suggest that NWBOLTON was suspected by some, including an individual named LPAVERT, of being involved in President Kennedy's assassination. There are concerns about NWBOLTON's potential covert affiliations being publicly disclosed due to the Assassination Records Review Board's document release. A person claiming a former association with NWBOLTON, Robert Plumlee (also known as William H. Pearson), contacted the Denver NVTAG office alleging he sabotaged a Denver Magazine article related to the assassination trail. Additionally, NWBOLTON's name is linked to a Rio <JFK> conference, suspected to be an anti-NWBOLTON propaganda effort by the Cubans. The documents span from 1995 to 1996, indicating ongoing interest or investigation into NWBOLTON's potential connections to the assassination during that period.",
