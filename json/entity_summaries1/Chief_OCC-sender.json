  "summary": "The Chief/Office of Covert Communications (OCC) within the CIA played a central role in managing the agency's compliance with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.  Specifically, the OCC was responsible for coordinating with various CIA stations (Paris, Bonn, Mexico City, Caracas, San Jose) to contact former employees residing abroad. The purpose of these communications was to inform these individuals that their names appeared in documents related to the JFK assassination records and that these documents were being reviewed for potential public release. The OCC provided guidance to these former employees on how to respond if they had concerns about the disclosure of their names. The cables and messages indicate a concentrated effort in March 1997, with one message dating back to November 1995, to ensure that former employees were notified and given the opportunity to address potential privacy concerns before the release of the JFK assassination records.",
