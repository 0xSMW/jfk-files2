  "summary": "The Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) was formed in 1961 under the guidance of the U.S. Government to unify Cuban exile groups against the Castro regime. It aimed to coordinate efforts to overthrow Castro and establish a unified plan of action for the underground resistance. The CRC faced internal issues, including frustration over the lack of support and coordination from the CIA, independent operations by the Agency in Cuba, and unresolved issues such as providing arms and funds. The CRC's activities and financial records were subjects of interest to the ARRB in relation to the JFK assassination records. The documents reveal the CIA's involvement with the CRC, including PM Case Officers maintaining contact with various segments of the Council. The CRC's existence highlights the U.S. government's efforts to support anti-Castro movements and the complexities of managing Cuban exile groups.",
