  "summary": "George Wackenhut was the President of The Wackenhut Corporation. The documents reveal that in 1963, the CIA's Central Cover Staff (CCS) met with Wackenhut to explore his firm's potential for providing cover support for CIA operations, including overseas ventures and potential integration of Agency personnel. Later documents indicate ongoing interactions between the CIA and Wackenhut Corporation, involving discussions about electronic surveillance technology, potential recruitment of former Agency personnel, and instances where Wackenhut provided services or information to the CIA. One document mentions Bruce Berkmans, a former CIA staff agent working for Wackenhut Corporation, and the possibility of using him as a DCD contact and gathering information from Wackenhut's international operations.",
