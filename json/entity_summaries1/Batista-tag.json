  "significance": "In the context of the JFK assassination, Batista's significance is indirect. The documents suggest the CIA's involvement in Cuban affairs before Castro's rise to power. The activities of anti-Castro Cubans, some with ties to the CIA, are often considered within the broader context of potential motives for the assassination, though these documents do not directly link Batista to the assassination.",
