  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, Phillip W. May's significance in the JFK context is not directly apparent. The documents relate to a counter-intelligence investigation in 1972, which is several years after the JFK assassination. Without further information, it's difficult to establish a direct link between May and the events surrounding the assassination. His role appears to be more related to routine counter-intelligence work within the military during the early 1970s.",
