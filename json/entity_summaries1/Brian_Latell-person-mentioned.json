  "summary": "Brian Latell is identified as the Director of the Center for the Study of Intelligence in 1995. His involvement in the JFK assassination context stems from advising against appealing the JFK Review Board's decision to release the names of two CIA employees who retired under cover. He argued that the DO's (Directorate of Operations) damage argument wouldn't merit Presidential reversal. The documents suggest his role was primarily related to the declassification and review of JFK assassination records within the CIA.",
