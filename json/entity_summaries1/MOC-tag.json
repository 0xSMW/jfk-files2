  "summary": "MOC stands for Memorandum of Oral Commitment. The documents indicate that MOCs were used by the CIA to formalize agreements with individuals, often related to operational activities. These commitments covered terms of engagement, compensation, and specific operational duties. The documents highlight the use of MOCs in the context of JMWAVE operations, specifically involving individuals like Alberto PONZOA y Alvarez (aka \"Junior\") for maritime operations and Subject 201-332676. The documents span from 1961 to 1965, showing a period of active use of MOCs. A notable pattern is the use of MOCs to engage individuals in specific operations, with details regarding their roles and compensation being formally documented.",

  "significance": "While the documents do not directly link MOCs to the JFK assassination, they reveal the CIA's operational practices and methods of engaging individuals in covert activities during the same period. The use of MOCs to formalize agreements with individuals involved in maritime and other operations suggests a network of individuals and activities that could potentially be relevant to understanding the broader context of the JFK assassination, depending on the specific individuals and operations involved.",
