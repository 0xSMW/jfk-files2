  "summary": "The documents highlight interrogation as a key intelligence gathering method. Yuriy Nosenko's case involves extensive assessments, including psychological and psychiatric evaluations, to determine his truthfulness as a KGB defector. The FBI compared CIA's assessment of Nosenko with information from interrogations of another defector, SAMMY, revealing deficiencies in CIA's conclusions. AMFAUNA-14's debriefing details her detention and interrogation by Cuban intelligence, uncovering her contacts and activities. In San Salvador, plans involved arresting and attempting recruitment of individuals through interrogation for joint operations. While not directly related to the JFK assassination, these documents illustrate the intelligence community's reliance on interrogation for gathering information, assessing individuals, and planning operations during the Cold War era, which provides context for understanding intelligence activities surrounding the JFK assassination.",
