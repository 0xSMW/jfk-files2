  "summary": "The Intelligence Medal of Merit is an award given by the CIA to recognize individuals for their meritorious service. The documents highlight several CIA employees who received this medal for their contributions over extended periods, such as David S. Morales for his 25 years of service across various regions and operations, David L. Christ for his pioneering work in electronics engineering and audio surveillance over 20 years, and James P. O'Connell, Jr. for his service from 1951 to 1973. The documents consist of recommendations for the award, personnel files, and memoranda related to the recognition of these individuals upon their retirement or departure from the agency. A notable pattern is the recognition of long-term service and significant contributions to the CIA's operations and technical capabilities.",
