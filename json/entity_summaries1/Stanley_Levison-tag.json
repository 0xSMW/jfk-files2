  "summary": "Stanley Levison was a key figure investigated by the FBI due to his close association with Martin Luther King Jr. and alleged ties to the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). The FBI's interest in Levison stemmed from concerns about potential communist influence within the Civil Rights Movement, particularly through King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Multiple documents detail the FBI's efforts to gather information on Levison's background, activities, and connections, including electronic surveillance and informant reports. The Senate Select Committee (SSC) also investigated Levison's alleged communist ties, prompting the FBI to provide materials establishing a factual basis for these allegations. Alan G. Sentinella's testimony before the SSC frequently references investigations into King, the SCLC, and Levison, highlighting the interconnected nature of these inquiries.",
