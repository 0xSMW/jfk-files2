  "summary": "The documents reference \"Communists\" in various contexts, primarily focusing on identifying and monitoring individuals and groups suspected of communist affiliations or sympathies during the Cold War era. These references appear in the context of US intelligence operations aimed at countering perceived communist influence in regions like El Salvador, Guatemala, and Vietnam. The documents suggest that the CIA was actively involved in gathering information on individuals and organizations suspected of communist ties, sharing intelligence with allied agencies, and supporting anti-communist movements. The documents do not directly link communists to the JFK assassination, but rather portray them as a general target of US intelligence efforts during the Cold War.",
