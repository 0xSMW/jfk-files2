  "summary": "The National Security Council (NSC) is a key entity involved in US foreign policy and national security matters. In the context of these documents, the NSC appears as a central point for discussions and decisions related to sensitive issues such as potential assassinations of foreign leaders (Trujillo, Castro, Lumumba) and US policy towards Cuba during the Cold War. The documents suggest the NSC played a role in coordinating and overseeing covert actions and in managing the flow of information related to these activities. The NSC also served as a point of contact for other government agencies, such as the FBI, regarding the release of classified documents to external investigations, such as the Senate Select Committee (Church Committee).",
