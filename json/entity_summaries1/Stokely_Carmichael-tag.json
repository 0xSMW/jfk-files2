  "summary": "Stokely Carmichael, a prominent figure in the Civil Rights Movement, is mentioned in three documents. These documents do not directly link him to the JFK assassination but rather place him within the broader context of surveillance and investigations during the 1960s and 1970s. One document references communist reactions to Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, while another details FBI mail opening operations and information requests concerning individuals on the National Security Agency (NSA) Watch List. The third document discusses requests for documentation related to the creation of a Special Counterintelligence Operation and a study on \"International Connections with the United States Peace Movement.\"",

The documents suggest that individuals and movements associated with social and political activism were subject to scrutiny and monitoring.",
