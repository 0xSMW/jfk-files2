  "summary": "File management, in the context of these documents, refers to the systems and procedures used by organizations, particularly the CIA, to organize, track, and control access to information. This includes document transfer protocols, cross-referencing systems for projects, and the maintenance of individual files. The \"201 system\" is a specific example of a CIA file management system used to track individuals of interest, detailing procedures for opening, maintaining, and restricting access to files. File management also encompasses actions such as equipment requests, passport renewals, and the provision of materials for review by external bodies like the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA).",

  "significance": "In the JFK assassination context, file management practices are significant because they determine how information related to individuals, projects, and events of interest was organized, accessed, and potentially controlled. The CIA's file management systems, such as the \"201 system\", could have played a role in tracking individuals connected to the assassination or in managing information related to relevant projects and operations. The provision of files to the HSCA indicates an attempt to provide transparency, but also highlights the importance of understanding how information was curated and presented.",
