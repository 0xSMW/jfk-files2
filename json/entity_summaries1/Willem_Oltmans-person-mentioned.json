Cables from November 9, 1977, report on his meetings and contacts with these diplomats, his travel to the USSR, and potential travel to Cuba. A recurring point across the documents is his connection to George de Mohrenschildt, which made him relevant to Congressional committees investigating matters related to the JFK assassination. The documents suggest that information about Oltmans' activities and connections was considered important enough to be conveyed to Congressional authorities.",
