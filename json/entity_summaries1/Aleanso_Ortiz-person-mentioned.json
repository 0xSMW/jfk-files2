  "summary": "Aleanso Ortiz is a character reference for Manuel Marti. In November 1968, an agent attempted to verify information provided by Ortiz as part of a character reference check for Marti. Another agent was unsuccessful in locating and interviewing Ortiz at 810 Hunts Point Avenue, Bronx, New York, to gather information about Marti. The documents suggest that Ortiz was contacted or listed as a reference by Marti, but the information provided by Ortiz is not detailed in the available summaries.",
