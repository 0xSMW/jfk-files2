  "summary": "Ghana, under President Kwame Nkrumah, appears in the documents primarily in the context of President Kennedy's assassination and its aftermath. Ghana sent representatives to Kennedy's funeral, with the Ghanaian Embassy advising Accra to send a high-prestige delegation to reflect Kennedy's interest in Ghana and strengthen relations. Mrs. Kennedy expressed her appreciation to Nkrumah for his message of condolence and representation. Separately, a document mentions a protest by African students in Moscow over the alleged killing of a Ghanaian student, suggesting the incident could be used to highlight racist attitudes and Soviet subversion in Africa. These documents suggest Ghana was a nation of interest to the Kennedy administration, and the assassination prompted diplomatic exchanges and considerations of its impact on US-Ghana relations.",
