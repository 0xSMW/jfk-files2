  "summary": "The tag 'Public Release' in these documents refers to the process mandated by the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which required the review and potential release of documents related to the JFK assassination. The CIA was tasked with identifying former employees whose names appeared in these documents and informing them of the potential public release. This involved contacting these individuals, often through CIA stations abroad, to offer them the opportunity to provide reasons why their names should not be released. The documents highlight the CIA's efforts to comply with the Act by notifying former employees and addressing their concerns regarding the release of their information.",
