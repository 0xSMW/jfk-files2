  "summary": "The Selective Service is referenced in the documents as the entity to which individuals like Robert Scheer and David Reed Fromer were registered. The documents primarily consist of agent reports detailing local agency checks and FBI file examinations conducted on these registrants. These checks were likely part of background investigations or security clearances. The reports indicate that the FBI had an ongoing interest in David Reed Fromer, with reports dating back to 1960, and copies of these reports were shared with the Department of the Army. The documents suggest a process of vetting individuals registered with the Selective Service, possibly related to national security concerns during the 1960s.",
