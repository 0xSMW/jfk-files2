  "summary": "Juanita Reyes is identified as a character reference for Manuel Marti in documents dated November 1968. Investigative efforts were made to contact her to verify information about Marti. Initial attempts to locate her at a provided address were unsuccessful, with reports indicating she no longer resided there and had possibly returned to Puerto Rico. A physical check at an address in the Bronx also yielded negative results. Eventually, contact was made, and Reyes stated she did not know Manuel Marti. The documents suggest a concerted effort to vet Marti's background by contacting his listed references.",
