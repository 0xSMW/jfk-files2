  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, Earle G. Wheeler's significance in the JFK assassination context is indirect. The documents focus on US efforts to counter Cuban subversion, a context relevant to the broader political climate surrounding the assassination. However, the documents do not directly link Wheeler to the assassination itself. His involvement appears to be related to the broader Cold War context and US foreign policy towards Cuba.",
