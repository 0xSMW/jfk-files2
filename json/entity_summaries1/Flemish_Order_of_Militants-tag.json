  "summary": "The documents refer to the 'Flemish Order of Militants' (also known as Vlaamse Militanten Orde or VMO), a Flemish militant order. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) requested information on the VMO in connection with its investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. The CIA was seeking guidance on how to respond to the HSCA request while preserving the relationship with NIGALE, an intelligence source. NITRUST, a liaison contact, was reluctant to share information on potential VMO-American contacts with the HSCA due to concerns about information leaks and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The documents are all dated in April and May of 1978.",
