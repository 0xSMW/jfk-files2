  "summary": "The documents provided do not directly mention NARA (National Archives and Records Administration). Instead, they focus on the CIA's interactions with the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), also referred to as the JFK Board. These interactions involve reviewing JFK assassination records, addressing issues related to sanitization, privacy, and inadvertent destruction of records. The documents cover topics such as the protection of specific information (LITAMIL-9, 'Aquatic' slug line), discussions about CIA official files, Mexico City tapes, and alias documentation. The timeline spans from 1994 to 1998, reflecting the period when the ARRB was actively reviewing and requesting access to assassination-related materials held by the CIA.",

The ARRB's work, as described in these documents, directly impacts the materials that NARA would eventually hold and make available to the public.",
