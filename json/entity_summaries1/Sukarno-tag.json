The documents suggest that Sukarno was a person of interest to the CIA, with multiple documents referencing his relationships and potential influence.

Maheu's involvement in operations related to Sukarno. Dutch journalist William Leonard Oltmans is mentioned as having relationships with Sukarno and communist countries.

  "significance": "Sukarno's significance in the JFK context is indirect. The documents suggest that the CIA was interested in influencing Sukarno, and that Robert A. Maheu, who is also connected to potential assassinations of foreign leaders, was involved in operations related to Sukarno. One document mentions Oltmans' testimony before the House of Representatives Assassinations Committee on George de Mohrenschildt's link to Lee Harvey Oswald, but Sukarno is not directly linked to the JFK assassination in these documents.",
