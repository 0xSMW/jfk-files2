  "significance": "Madrid's significance in the JFK context is primarily related to the investigation of a letter sent to the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, which prompted the FBI to request assistance from the High General Staff (HGS) in Madrid. Additionally, the presence of individuals connected to Cuban intelligence and exile groups in Madrid suggests a potential link, albeit indirect, to the broader context of the assassination, given the historical tensions between the U.S. and Cuba.",
