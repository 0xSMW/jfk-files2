  "summary": "The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was established to oversee the declassification and release of records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, as mandated by the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The ARRB worked with various government agencies, including the CIA, to review and release assassination-related documents while balancing the public interest with concerns about national security and personal privacy. A recurring theme in the documents is the ARRB's role in determining the release status of HSCA (House Select Committee on Assassinations) staff payroll records, often postponing the release of Social Security numbers to protect personal privacy. The ARRB engaged in discussions with the CIA regarding the release of sensitive information, such as the identities of human sources, CIA employees, and details about intelligence operations. They also worked to obtain records from foreign governments, such as the BKGB (Belarusian KGB), related to Lee Harvey Oswald's time in Minsk.",
