  "summary": "Richard Case Nagell is a figure mentioned in several CIA cables and memoranda. He is described as someone who threatened to expose his contacts with an organization referred to as 'WOFIRM' if promises made by US officials were not honored. He was active in Zurich, where he claimed a document intended for American military authorities in Berlin was stolen. He is also characterized as a 'fabricator' and a 'mental case' who caused trouble for Swiss and U.S. consulates. A memorandum outlines procedures for handling Office of Security files reviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) regarding Nagell, ensuring sensitive information remains protected. His name also appears in Dick Russell's book 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'.",

The documents suggest concern within the CIA regarding his potential to reveal information, as evidenced by the procedures put in place to protect certain information during the HSCA review. However, he is also described as unreliable, which complicates assessing his true significance.",
