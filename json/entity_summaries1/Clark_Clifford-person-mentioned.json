  "summary": "Clark Clifford is mentioned in several documents related to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) and an inventory of Rockefeller Commission files. While the documents do not explicitly detail Clifford's direct involvement in the JFK assassination context, his presence in discussions and meetings related to intelligence activities during the period leading up to and following the assassination suggests his awareness of relevant information. He appears in the minutes and agendas of PFIAB meetings from 1963 and 1964, indicating his involvement in advising the President on foreign intelligence matters. The Rockefeller Commission files, which include documents related to the CIA's activities and the Kennedy assassination, also mention him, though the specific nature of his involvement is not detailed in the provided summaries. His role seems to be primarily advisory within the context of national security and intelligence.",
