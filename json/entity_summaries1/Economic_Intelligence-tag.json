While not directly linked to the assassination plot in these documents, economic factors could influence political decisions and actions related to Cuba, which was a focal point of US foreign policy during that era. The economic intelligence gathered could inform strategies related to Cuba and potentially influence decisions related to covert operations or political actions.",
