  "summary": "Huey P. Newton, a prominent figure as a co-founder of the Black Panther Party (BPP), is mentioned in these documents primarily in the context of FBI surveillance and monitoring of the BPP. The documents do not directly link Newton to the JFK assassination. Instead, they highlight the FBI's interest in the BPP's activities, including requests for telephone surveillances based on alleged extremist activities and potential threats to national security. One document mentions Bobby Seale's visit to Norway and his views on the Black Panther Party, further illustrating the international attention and scrutiny the BPP received. The documents collectively suggest a pattern of government surveillance and concern regarding the BPP's activities during the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
