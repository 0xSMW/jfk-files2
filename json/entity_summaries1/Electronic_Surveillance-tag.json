  "significance": "While the documents do not directly link electronic surveillance to the JFK assassination, they highlight the context of intelligence agency activities during that era. The concerns about domestic surveillance, potential overreach, and the involvement of entities like the CIA and FBI in these activities provide a backdrop for understanding the environment in which the JFK assassination investigation took place. The Senate Select Committee's scrutiny of these activities suggests a broader concern about the potential for abuse of power within these agencies.",
