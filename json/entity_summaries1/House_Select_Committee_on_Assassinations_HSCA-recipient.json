Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The CIA provided materials to the HSCA for review at CIA headquarters. The HSCA investigated allegations of CIA involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald, including claims that Oswald was a CIA agent while stationed in Tokyo and whether the CIA routinely debriefed returning American defectors from the Soviet Union. The CIA consistently denied any contact with Oswald. The HSCA's investigation spanned from September 1976 to June 1978, involving meetings, requests for information, and correspondence between the HSCA and the CIA.",
