These checks, conducted by USAINTC and the U.S. Army Advanced Weapons Support Command, compile personal information including his birth details (born in West Germany), family history, residences, employment history, and foreign connections, specifically travel to the USSR and Poland. The NACRs also document his immigration to the U.S. and active duty in the U.S. Army.
