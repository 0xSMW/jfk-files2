  "summary": "The available documents mention \"Prostitutes\" in the context of a CIA cable reporting allegations that Robert Maheu violated the Mann Act by procuring prostitutes for a foreign leader during a state visit in 1956. The other two documents are about Yurily Ivanovich Nosenko, a Soviet KGB officer who defected in 1964 and was involuntarily confined by the CIA for approximately three years, detailing the legal justifications for his confinement, the conditions of his confinement, and his subsequent employment by the Agency as a consultant. The connection between these documents is not explicitly stated, but it appears that the mention of prostitutes is related to potential illegal activities and ethical concerns involving individuals connected to intelligence operations.",
