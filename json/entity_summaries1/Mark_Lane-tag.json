  "summary": "Mark Lane was an individual of interest to the FBI and CIA, particularly in the years following the JFK assassination. The documents indicate that Lane was actively involved in promoting the idea of Oswald's innocence in the Kennedy assassination, giving speeches and disseminating information. The FBI, through its Legat office in Bern, Switzerland, monitored Lane's activities, gathering information from Austrian and Swiss police, as well as covert CIA sources. This information was shared with various U.S. and foreign law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Later, in 1998, Lane's name appears in a memo discussing pending issues before the ARRB (JFK Board), suggesting continued relevance in the context of JFK assassination records and investigations.",
