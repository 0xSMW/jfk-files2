  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, there appears to be a misunderstanding in the entity name. The documents refer to Alan G. Sentinella, a retired FBI Special Agent, not Al Miller. Alan G. Sentinella testified before the Senate Select Committee (SSC) on May 21, 1975, regarding investigations into Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison. His testimony covered topics such as electronic surveillance and potential communist influence within these organizations. The documents consistently summarize Sentinella's testimony before the SSC on the same date, focusing on the same subjects.",
