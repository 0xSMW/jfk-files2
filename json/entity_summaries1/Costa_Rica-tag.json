  "summary": "Costa Rica appears in the documents primarily as a location for CIA operations, agent activities, and as a transit point or residence for individuals of interest. It served as a base for Guatemalan exiles in the 1950s, a location for Project HUMANOID, and a meeting place for drug traffickers. The CIA sought operational clearances for agents to be used in Costa Rica and maintained contact with former employees residing there, particularly concerning the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act. The documents also mention potential illicit armament traffic and communist activities in Costa Rica in the 1950s. Overall, Costa Rica's significance lies in its geographical role as a site for various covert activities and a point of contact for individuals linked to CIA operations and other events of interest.",

  "significance": "Costa Rica's significance in the JFK context is primarily related to the potential release of information about former CIA employees residing there, as part of the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act. The documents suggest the CIA was proactive in contacting these individuals to inform them of the potential public release of their information and offer them the opportunity to prevent it. However, the documents do not directly link Costa Rica to the assassination itself, but rather to the subsequent declassification process.",
