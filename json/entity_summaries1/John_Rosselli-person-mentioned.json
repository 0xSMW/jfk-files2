The documents detail his activities, whereabouts, and associations, primarily in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. He was involved in various activities, including car rentals, hotel and casino deals, and financial transactions. The FBI tracked his movements, contacts, and potential involvement in suppressing scandals. Rosselli's connections included individuals like Irving J. Leff, Joseph I. Breen, Jr., Jack Brooks (Brookstein), Bryan Foy, Jonie Taps, Albert Foley, Maurice Friedman, Gordon Nesser, and Emanuel Rothman. The documents also mention his presence at the Friar-s Club and conversations about firearm purchases during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The FBI's interest in Rosselli appears to stem from investigations into his corporations and potential criminal activities.",
