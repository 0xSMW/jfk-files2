He appears in documents concerning the Diem regime in Vietnam, discussions by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), and the ROK President's visit to the U.S. These documents suggest Hilsman was involved in or had knowledge of significant foreign policy and intelligence matters during the Kennedy administration. The documents span from 1961 to 1975, indicating his involvement in these matters extended beyond the immediate period surrounding the JFK assassination.",
