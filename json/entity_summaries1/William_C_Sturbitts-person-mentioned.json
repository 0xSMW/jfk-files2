  "significance": "William C. Sturbitts' significance in the JFK assassination context lies in his involvement in CIA's Cuban operations and anti-Castro activities. While a Latin America Division task force report found no definitive proof of Cuban involvement in the assassination, Sturbitts' depositions reveal his knowledge of potential assassination attempts against Fidel Castro, which is relevant to understanding the broader context of US-Cuban relations and potential motives for Cuban involvement in the JFK assassination. His role provides insight into the CIA's activities and strategies concerning Cuba during the period leading up to and following the assassination.",
