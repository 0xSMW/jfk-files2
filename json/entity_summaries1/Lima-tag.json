  "summary": "Lima is mentioned in the documents primarily as a location where CIA stations received information or where events related to Cuban interests occurred. In one instance, a classified message regarding Grace Holmes and a P.O. box in Coral Gables, Florida, was sent to CIA stations in Mexico City, Bogota, Lima, and Guatemala. Another document discusses an attack on a Cuban Embassy attache's house in Lima, Peru, and references coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations. The American Embassy did not submit a report. The documents suggest Lima's relevance lies in its role as a point of communication for CIA activities and as a site of anti-Cuban activity.",
