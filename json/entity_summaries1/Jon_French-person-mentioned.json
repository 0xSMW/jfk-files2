  "summary": "Jon French is identified as being affiliated with DCD (likely a division within an organization, potentially related to intelligence or law enforcement). The documents highlight his involvement in monitoring Frank Sturgis, particularly concerning Sturgis's possession of cryptographic material obtained from Marita Lorenz and his intention to share it with Senator Baker. French's role appears to be one of information gathering and monitoring, specifically related to Sturgis's activities and potential impact. One document also mentions the possibility of using Bruce Berkmans, a former CIA staff agent working for Wackenhut Corporation, as a DCD contact, although French's direct involvement in this is not explicitly stated.",
