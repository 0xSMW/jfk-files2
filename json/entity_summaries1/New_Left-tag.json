  "summary": "The documents provided mention the 'New Left' in the context of FBI investigations and surveillance during the 1960s and 1970s. Specifically, the FBI sought authorization for telephone surveillances on organizations associated with the New Left, such as Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). These surveillances were justified based on alleged extremist activities and potential threats to national security. The documents also touch upon the FBI's broader counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) and its actions against various groups, including those associated with the New Left. The documents highlight the FBI's focus on domestic dissident groups and the challenges of coordinating intelligence operations during this period.",

  "significance": "The 'New Left' is mentioned in the context of FBI surveillance and counterintelligence operations, but the provided documents do not directly link the 'New Left' to the JFK assassination. The significance lies in understanding the broader political and social climate of the time, where domestic dissident groups were under intense scrutiny by federal agencies.",
