The documents also reveal connections between CIA personnel and individuals or organizations that may have been relevant to the assassination, such as those involved in Cuban-related activities or those who had contact with Lee Harvey Oswald. The documents also show the CIA's efforts to manage and conceal the identities and activities of its personnel, which could be relevant to understanding the agency's role in the assassination and subsequent investigations.",
