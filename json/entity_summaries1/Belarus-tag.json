  "summary": "Belarus, specifically Minsk, served as a location of interest in the context of the JFK assassination due to Lee Harvey Oswald's time living there. The CIA's Minsk station was involved in discussions and coordination with the FBI and the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) to access KGB files related to Oswald's activities in Minsk. The Belarusian KGB (BKGB) held records that the ARRB sought to review, leading to requests for access and facilitation of meetings. The documents reveal concerns about unilaterally handling the files due to distrust related to the Kennedy assassination and challenges in obtaining the records due to privacy laws and past failed attempts. The timeline spans from the early 1990s to 1998, with a focus on accessing and reviewing records related to Oswald's time in Minsk.",
