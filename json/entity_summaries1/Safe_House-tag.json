  "summary": "The documents refer to safe houses in the context of CIA operations. One document mentions SR safe houses being used for training and assessment of REDSKIN agent candidates outside of Washington, D.C. This suggests that safe houses were utilized as secure locations for sensitive activities such as agent training and assessment. Another document mentions the handling of a Soviet defector, implying the potential use of safe houses for temporary accommodation or secure transit during defection operations. The third document does not directly relate to safe houses, but rather discusses a meeting between individuals and their plans, which could indirectly involve safe houses for clandestine meetings or operations.",

  "significance": "The significance of safe houses in the JFK context, based on these documents, is primarily related to their role in covert operations, agent training, and handling defectors. While these documents do not directly link safe houses to the JFK assassination, they illustrate the CIA's use of such facilities for clandestine activities, which could be relevant in understanding the broader operational context of the time.",
