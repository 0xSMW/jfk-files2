  "summary": "The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act is referenced in documents pertaining to the Assassination Records Review Board's (ARRB) decisions regarding the release of HSCA (House Select Committee on Assassinations) staff payroll records. These documents are final determination notifications issued by the ARRB in December 1995. The notifications concern the postponement of releasing specific information, namely Social Security numbers, from the HSCA staff payroll records to protect personal privacy. The ARRB acknowledges the historical interest in the documents while balancing it with the need to safeguard personal information. The consistent pattern across these documents is the ARRB's cautious approach to releasing sensitive personal data, even within historically significant records related to the JFK assassination investigation.",
