  "summary": "JYVAPOROUS is an individual connected to the JFK assassination, specifically related to Lee Harvey Oswald's files in Minsk, Belarus. The Records Review Board sought access to JYVAPOROUS, who responded positively to an embassy note. JYVAPOROUS/1 visited headquarters in July 1993, where discussions included Lee Harvey Oswald files and potential joint operations. In 1995, there was a request for guidance on whether to question JYVAPOROUS about sharing Oswald files with Norman Mailer, given the US government's displeasure. The documents indicate that JYVAPOROUS was a point of contact or individual with access to information related to Lee Harvey Oswald's time in Minsk and that the US government was interested in accessing these files, sometimes through diplomatic channels and sometimes directly.",
