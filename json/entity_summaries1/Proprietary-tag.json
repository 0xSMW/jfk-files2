  "summary": "The term \"Proprietary\" appears in the documents primarily in the context of protecting Agency assets and covert operations. In one instance, a \"KUBARK proprietary\" is used as a front for procuring a DC-3 aircraft to transport stranded newsmen from SDOM, highlighting the use of proprietaries for cover. Another document mentions the potential exposure of Agency assets and proprietaries due to media inquiries regarding Cuban involvement in the Watergate case and related attitudes in Miami. The documents suggest that proprietaries are entities or operations owned or controlled by the Agency, used to maintain secrecy and provide cover for sensitive activities. The documents do not directly link the entity to the JFK assassination.",
