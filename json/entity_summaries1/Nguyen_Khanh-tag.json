The US government's stance towards Diem and the coup has been a subject of historical analysis, particularly concerning its potential impact on the political stability of South Vietnam and the subsequent course of the Vietnam War. His actions contributed to the instability in South Vietnam, which indirectly relates to the broader context of US foreign policy during the Kennedy administration.",
