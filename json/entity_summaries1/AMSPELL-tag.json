Its activities included radio broadcasts, press releases, and mailings designed to shape public opinion and exploit events, such as Che Guevara's disappearance. The organization's efforts were aimed at countering pro-Castro sentiments and promoting anti-communist views. AMSPELL conducted tours of Latin America to showcase exhibits and engage with local populations. The organization faced organizational challenges and required financial support from the CIA to sustain its operations. The timeline of AMSPELL's activities spans from at least September 1962 to July 1966, as indicated by the progress reports and dispatches.",
