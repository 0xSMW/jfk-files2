Specifically, he is mentioned in a memorandum advising the Office of Finance about the termination of consultant agreements effective June 30, 1974. While the documents do not explicitly link Sandman to the JFK assassination, his position within the Contract Personnel Division suggests he was involved in the administrative aspects of managing personnel, including consultants, within the organization during the relevant time frame.",
