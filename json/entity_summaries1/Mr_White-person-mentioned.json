  "summary": "Based on the provided documents, there is insufficient information to provide a comprehensive summary about Mr. White. The documents mention various topics including Senate Select Committee investigations, cancellation of military cover, requests for documentation, and testimony about CIA mail opening projects. However, none of the documents explicitly detail who Mr. White is, his role, or his connections to other people, organizations, or events. Therefore, it is not possible to determine his significance or involvement in the JFK assassination context based solely on these documents.",
