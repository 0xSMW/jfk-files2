  "summary": "Tom Moore was a staffer for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) in 1976. He is mentioned in NSA documents related to the SSCI's investigation into Cuban intelligence networks and potential assassination plots, specifically concerning Antonio Veciana. Moore, along with Howard Liebengood, met with NSA's John C. Wobensmith to review an NSA product on Veciana, which led to the SSCI requesting a review of all Cuban material from 1961-1965. His role appears to be part of the SSCI's effort to gather information related to the JFK assassination and related Cuban matters.",
