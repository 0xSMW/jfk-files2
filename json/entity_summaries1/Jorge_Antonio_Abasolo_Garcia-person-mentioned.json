  "summary": "Jorge Antonio Abasolo Garcia was a Cuban industrial engineer who had ties to Che Guevara. In the early 1960s, the CIA was interested in potentially recruiting him as an asset, due to his disillusionment with the Cuban regime. His brother, Gustavo Abasolo (AMSEVER-2), was already a CIA asset and provided information about Jorge's feelings towards the Cuban government. The CIA considered offering financial support to Abasolo's children to encourage his cooperation and willingness to provide information while remaining in place. The CIA was interested in gathering information from him due to his contact with Che Guevara.",
