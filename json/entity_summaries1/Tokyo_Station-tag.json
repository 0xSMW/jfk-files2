  "summary": "Tokyo Station refers to a CIA station located in Tokyo, Japan. The documents indicate that the station was active in the early 1960s and its existence was a sensitive matter, particularly concerning the JFK Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s. The CIA was concerned about the potential release of information confirming the existence of the Tokyo Station, fearing it could damage US-Japan relations and compromise ongoing intelligence operations. The station's activities and personnel are mentioned in connection to allegations involving Lee Harvey Oswald's potential ties to the CIA while stationed in Tokyo, based on claims made by James Wilcott. Additionally, there are records related to the Tokyo Station Position Control Register pages for 1960-64, with missing data for September and December 1963.",
