  "summary": "Clarence M. Kelley was the Director of the FBI during the time period covered by these documents (June 1975). The documents primarily concern the FBI's responses to requests from Congressional committees, particularly the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (also known as the Church Committee), regarding investigations, COINTELPRO, and related matters. While the documents do not directly implicate Kelley in the JFK assassination, they show him overseeing the FBI's cooperation with congressional inquiries into sensitive matters, including those potentially related to the CIA's activities and the Kennedy assassination, as indicated by the inventory of Rockefeller Commission files. The documents suggest Kelley was responsible for managing the FBI's response to congressional oversight and inquiries into past activities, including those that might have touched on the JFK assassination.",
