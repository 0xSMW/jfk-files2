The documents suggest that Ruiz was a person of interest to the CIA, possibly due to his connections to individuals and activities related to Cuban intelligence. One document specifically includes intelligence reports related to him, along with Orestes Perez and Alexander Samko (AMAUTO-1). While the exact nature of his involvement is not explicitly stated, the documents imply that he was under surveillance or investigation due to potential connections to Cuban intelligence or other foreign entities.
