  "summary": "John F. Rittenhouse was associated with the CIA's Overseas Branch (OPC). In late 1950, there were plans to change his status from OPC Staff Employee to OPC Staff Agent and assign him to Mexico City as a GS-13 Intelligence Officer under State Department deep cover. This plan involved security concurrence and reclassification. However, his security clearance was subsequently canceled, and he was reclassified as a semi-covert employee integrated into a department. The documents suggest a shift in Rittenhouse's role and assignment within the CIA during this period.",
