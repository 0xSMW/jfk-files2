  "summary": "Key West appears in the documents primarily as a point of departure or a location connected to clandestine activities. One document mentions the TEJANA departing from Key West on February 25, 1961, as part of Operation JEAN, involving the infiltration of cargo and personnel. While the documents do not explicitly link Key West to the JFK assassination, its role as a staging point for covert operations, particularly those involving Cuban exiles and potential CIA involvement, suggests its relevance to the broader context of anti-Castro activities and related tensions during that era. The documents highlight Key West's geographical significance for operations targeting Cuba.",
