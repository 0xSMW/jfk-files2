  "summary": "The documents suggest that Counterterrorism, specifically the CIA's Counterintelligence/Counterterrorism division (VYSWORD), was involved in requesting documents related to Jean Rene Soutre, an OAS captain, potentially in connection to the JFK assassination investigation. The documents also reveal concerns within the CIA regarding the release of information by the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) that could compromise ongoing operations and relationships with foreign governments, such as France and Japan. The CIA was actively trying to protect its undeclared officers, activities, and the existence of its stations from being exposed, fearing scrutiny and hostile exploitation.",
