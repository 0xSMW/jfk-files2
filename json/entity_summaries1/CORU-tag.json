  "summary": "CORU (Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations) was an organization of Cuban exiles. The documents indicate CORU's involvement in various activities, including a meeting in the Dominican Republic in June 1976, as well as an attack on a Cuban Embassy attache's house in Lima, Peru. The organization is also linked to investigations into the death of Orlando Letelier. The documents suggest CORU was active in the mid-1970s, with mentions spanning from 1976 to 1977. A notable pattern is CORU's involvement in anti-Castro activities and potential connections to violence and terrorism.",

  "significance": "Based on the provided documents, CORU's significance in the JFK context is not directly apparent. The documents focus on CORU's activities in the mid-1970s, well after the JFK assassination. However, the organization's association with anti-Castro activities and individuals potentially involved in violence and terrorism could be relevant in broader investigations into anti-Castro groups and their activities during the Cold War era, which might indirectly relate to the JFK assassination context.",
