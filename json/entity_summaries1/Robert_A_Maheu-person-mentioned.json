  "significance": "While the documents detail Maheu's involvement in sensitive CIA operations, including plots against Fidel Castro, they do not directly link him to the JFK assassination. His significance lies in his role as a key figure in covert operations during the Cold War era, and his connections to individuals and organizations potentially relevant to understanding the broader context of the assassination.",
