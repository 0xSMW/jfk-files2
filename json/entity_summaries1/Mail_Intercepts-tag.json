  "summary": "Mail intercepts refer to the practice of intercepting and examining mail without the sender's or recipient's knowledge or consent. The documents suggest that mail intercepts were part of the CIA's activities, as indicated in Howard J. Osborn's testimony regarding the activities of the CIA's Office of Security. While the documents do not explicitly link mail intercepts directly to the JFK assassination, the inventory of Rockefeller Commission files, which includes documents related to the Kennedy assassination, suggests that the commission investigated CIA activities, including potentially mail intercepts. The documents also highlight concerns about protecting sensitive sources and methods, which could relate to mail intercept programs. The timeline of involvement is not explicitly detailed, but the documents span from 1961 to 1975, indicating that mail intercepts were a practice employed during this period.",
