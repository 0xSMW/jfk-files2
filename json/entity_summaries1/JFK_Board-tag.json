  "summary": "The JFK Board, formally known as the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), was responsible for reviewing and releasing JFK assassination-related records. The documents indicate ongoing negotiations and potential conflicts between the CIA and the JFK Board regarding the release of sensitive information. The CIA sought to protect sensitive agency equities and operational details, including unacknowledged covert actions, alias documentation, organizational materials, Mexico City tapes, protection of LITAMIL-9, Richard Gibson (CIA Asset), and files of CIA officials. The board was active between 1996 and 1998, addressing issues such as the release of true names of individuals like Jose Marie Mankel and the protection of individuals like John Whitten.",
