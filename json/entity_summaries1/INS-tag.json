  "summary": "The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) appears in these documents primarily in the context of providing information or being requested to provide information on individuals of interest to the CIA. One document mentions a request from the INS to potentially use a covert Agency employee, Balmes Hidalgo Jr., as an informant. Another document mentions the arrest of Francisco RODRIGUEZ Tamayo, who was allegedly planning to assassinate an unknown target. While the documents do not explicitly link the INS to the JFK assassination, they indicate the INS's role in immigration matters and potential involvement in gathering information on individuals who may have been involved in criminal activities or were of interest to national security agencies.",

  "significance": "The significance of the INS in the JFK context, based on these documents, is indirect. The INS is shown as an agency that could potentially provide information on individuals of interest to the CIA, but there is no direct evidence linking them to the assassination itself. The documents highlight the INS's role in immigration matters and potential involvement in gathering information on individuals who may have been involved in criminal activities or were of interest to national security agencies.",
