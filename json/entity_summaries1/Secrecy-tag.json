  "summary": "The documents highlight the CIA's consistent efforts to maintain secrecy regarding its operations, personnel, and sources, particularly in the context of the JFK assassination records and other sensitive activities. This includes protecting the identities of human intelligence sources, concealing CIA involvement in operations like the Glomar Explorer project and the establishment of weapons caches, and using cover arrangements to hide the agency's connections to individuals and organizations. The CIA's concerns about releasing information stem from risks to personal safety, potential damage to ongoing operations, and the need to protect relationships with cover providers. The documents span from 1955 to 1996, indicating a long-standing pattern of prioritizing secrecy within the agency.",
