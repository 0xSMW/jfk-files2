The FBI investigated their activities, particularly their expansion into Pittsburgh, where they used a clothing store as a front. Their gambling operations faced increased law enforcement scrutiny, including IRS investigations into key figures like Willie Sams. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) also provided information about Samuel and Gabriel Mannarino and their associates to the FBI. The documents suggest a pattern of operating gambling businesses, facing law enforcement pressure, and being considered armed and dangerous.",
