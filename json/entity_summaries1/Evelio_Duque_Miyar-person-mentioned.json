  "summary": "Evelio Duque Miyar was a Cuban anti-communist who had past interactions with the CIA. The CIA provided assistance to him at one point but later terminated the relationship due to disagreements over operational control. In the early 1960s, he may have been involved in Cuban operations in the Miami area. In 1978, he opened a confectionery store across from the consulate in Guayaquil, Ecuador. There were also concerns about his potential connections to drug trafficking and exile group affiliations. The CIA requested traces on him to determine his background and activities.",
