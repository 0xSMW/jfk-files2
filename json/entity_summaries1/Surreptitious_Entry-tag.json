  "summary": "Surreptitious entry, in the context of these documents, refers to covert operations involving unauthorized access to locations, particularly for intelligence gathering. The documents highlight instances where such activities were considered or requested by agencies like the CIA. Specifically, one memorandum mentions a request from the CIA to surreptitiously enter the Chilean Embassy in Washington, D.C. This indicates a willingness to engage in clandestine operations on foreign soil. While the documents do not explicitly link surreptitious entry to the JFK assassination, they reveal the operational mindset and capabilities of intelligence agencies during that era, suggesting a potential for covert actions.",
