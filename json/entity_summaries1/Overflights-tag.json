  "significance": "While the provided documents do not directly link \"Overflights\" to the JFK assassination, they illustrate the intelligence operations and geopolitical climate of the era. The U-2 project and reconnaissance flights over Cuba, in particular, reflect the heightened tensions and intelligence gathering activities that were prevalent during the Cold War, which form the broader historical context in which the assassination occurred. The HSCA's interest in the U-2 project suggests a potential avenue of inquiry related to intelligence activities, though the specific connection to the assassination is not detailed in these documents.",
