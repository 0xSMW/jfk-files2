  "summary": "The documents mention \"consultant\" as a role held by individuals in different contexts. Newton S. Miler's records include memoranda regarding his contract termination as a consultant. Yurily Ivanovich Nosenko, a KGB defector, later became a U.S. citizen and an Agency consultant. The third document references a magazine article that incorrectly stated U.S. Intelligence underwrote the development of an Identi-kit, leading to an investigation. While the term \"consultant\" appears in these documents, there is no direct connection to the JFK assassination context. The role of a consultant varies, from contract-based work to advisory positions within intelligence agencies.",
