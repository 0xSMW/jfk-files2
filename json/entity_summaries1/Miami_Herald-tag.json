  "summary": "The Miami Herald appears in the documents primarily in the context of JMWAVE's (CIA's Miami station) operations and its relationship with journalists. Specifically, the documents highlight the use of a Miami Herald journalist, codenamed AMCARBON-1, for operational support, intelligence gathering, and as a propaganda outlet. This relationship spanned from at least December 1962 to March 1964. Additionally, the Miami Herald published articles in May 1962 concerning Cuban exile leadership, specifically the replacement of Miro Cardona by Manuel Ray, allegedly with U.S. backing, which caused concern within the Cuban community and prompted a CIA response to manage the narrative. The documents suggest the Miami Herald, or at least some of its personnel, were used by the CIA for both intelligence and propaganda purposes during this period.",

  "significance": "The Miami Herald's significance in the JFK context lies in its connection to CIA's JMWAVE operations and the potential use of its journalists for intelligence and propaganda purposes. The documents suggest a media outlet was potentially compromised or co-opted to serve the CIA's interests, which raises questions about the integrity of news reporting during this period. The articles published by the Miami Herald regarding Cuban exile leadership also reflect the political tensions and covert operations surrounding Cuba during the early 1960s.",
