  "summary": "The documents relate to the potential public disclosure of information, specifically names and associations, under the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The CIA's Office of Covert Communications (OCC) is contacting various stations (Paris, Bonn, Mexico City, Hong Kong) to assist in informing former employees residing overseas that their names appear in JFK assassination records. The purpose is to advise them of the potential public release of their information and offer guidance on how to respond if they have concerns, including requesting postponement of public disclosure. One document mentions a LACOS contact expressing concerns about the public disclosure of their association with TOHIGHROAD due to privacy and security issues related to their overseas cover. The timeline centers around March-June 1997, when these notifications were being actively pursued.",
