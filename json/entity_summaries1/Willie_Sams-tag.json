  "significance": "Willie Sams's significance in the JFK context is indirect, primarily related to his involvement in the Mannarino's gambling operations, which were under investigation by the FBI. The documents suggest that Sams was a person of interest due to his potential connections to law enforcement as an informant, which the FBI sought to exploit. However, the documents do not directly link Willie Sams to the JFK assassination.",
