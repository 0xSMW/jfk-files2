  "summary": "Jim Garrison was the District Attorney of New Orleans who investigated the JFK assassination, believing it was a conspiracy. The documents reveal that the CIA and FBI were monitoring Garrison's activities. One document mentions that MI-5 informed the FBI about Garrison being contacted by the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation to write an article about the Kennedy assassination. Another document details requests from the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) to the CIA regarding JFK assassination records, which would likely include information related to Garrison's investigation. The documents suggest a timeline of involvement starting around 1967 when Garrison was contacted about writing an article, and continuing through the 1970s with depositions and investigations into related matters.",
