  "summary": "The Martin Luther King Task Force was a component of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The documents provided primarily relate to the payroll records of individuals employed by the Task Force, including Research Attorneys like Thomas Wayne Sacco and Kenneth S. McHargh, and researchers like Barbara Jean Robinson and Elizabeth C. Feeley. These records detail their appointments, salaries, and terminations. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) issued a Final Determination Notification regarding the postponement of certain information, specifically Social Security numbers, within these payroll records due to privacy concerns. The documents span from 1977 to 1978, with a later notification from the ARRB in 1995. A notable pattern is the focus on administrative aspects of the Task Force, specifically personnel and payroll.",
