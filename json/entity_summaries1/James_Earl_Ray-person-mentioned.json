The documents detail efforts to identify and track him, including requests for identikit composites, fingerprint formulas, and physical descriptions.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigated potential leads related to Ray in Portugal, the UK, and Mexico. The documents span from April 1968, immediately following the assassination, to the late 1970s during the HSCA investigation, indicating ongoing interest in Ray's activities and potential connections.",
