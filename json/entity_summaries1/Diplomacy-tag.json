  "significance": "While 'Diplomacy' itself isn't directly tied to the JFK assassination, the documents illustrate the geopolitical landscape and diplomatic challenges faced by the US government during that time. The focus on Cuba, in particular, is relevant given the tensions surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion, which were significant factors in the broader context of the JFK presidency. The documents provide insight into the types of diplomatic issues and international relations that were at play during the JFK era.",
