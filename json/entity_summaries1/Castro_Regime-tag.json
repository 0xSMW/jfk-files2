  "significance": "The documents suggest the Castro regime was a significant focus of U.S. intelligence and covert operations during the period leading up to and following the JFK assassination. While the documents do not directly link the Castro regime to the assassination, they illustrate the intense political tensions and hostile environment that existed between the U.S. and Cuba, which is a relevant context for understanding potential motives and actors involved in the assassination.",
