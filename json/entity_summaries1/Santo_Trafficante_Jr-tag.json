  "summary": "Santo Trafficante Jr. was a prominent figure of interest to the FBI, particularly in the late 1950s and 1960s. The documents reveal investigations into his activities, including potential racketeering, gambling, and associations with organized crime figures. His daughter's wedding in Havana, Cuba, in 1959 drew attention due to the attendance of known underworld associates. The FBI tracked his travels, including trips to London, Madrid, and Lisbon, investigating possible property purchases and connections. He was also associated with Eloy Garcia, a Cuban national involved in gambling. The FBI sought to identify his connections and whereabouts, including meetings with Carlos Marcello and Joseph Marcello. The investigations involved gathering information from confidential sources, conducting telephone toll analyses, and coordinating with international law enforcement agencies.",
