  "summary": "Sanitization, in the context of the JFK assassination records, refers to the process of redacting or removing sensitive information from documents before their release to the public. This process is mentioned in several documents related to the CIA's review of JFK assassination records and FOIA requests. The documents highlight the balancing act between transparency and the need to protect sensitive sources, methods, and privacy concerns. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) played a key role in overseeing the CIA's sanitization efforts, making decisions on CIA requests concerning crypts, project names, and the handling of sensitive foreign documents. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was also involved in discussions regarding the release of file material related to Lee Harvey Oswald, emphasizing the need to protect sensitive sources and methods during the sanitization process. The documents span from 1975 to 1998, indicating ongoing concerns and efforts related to sanitization over several decades.",

In the JFK context, it directly impacts the availability and completeness of records related to the assassination, influencing public understanding and historical narratives. The process is central to debates about transparency, government accountability, and the potential for uncovering new information related to the assassination.",
