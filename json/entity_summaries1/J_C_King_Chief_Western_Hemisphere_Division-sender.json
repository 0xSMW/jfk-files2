  "summary": "J. C. King was the Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division. The documents available indicate his involvement in overseeing Cuban operations, as evidenced by a report on Cuban operations from September 1-15, 1961. He was also involved in planning to exploit Khrushchev's visit to Cuba in 1960. The documents suggest King's role was primarily operational and strategic, focusing on intelligence gathering, propaganda, and potential political actions related to Cuba and the broader Western Hemisphere. The documents do not directly link King to the JFK assassination, but they highlight his involvement in significant Cold War activities related to Cuba.",
