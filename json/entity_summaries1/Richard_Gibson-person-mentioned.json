  "summary": "Richard Gibson is identified in the documents as having connections to Lee Harvey Oswald and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). One document mentions a CIA message reporting on the magazine 'Revolution' in Paris denouncing Gibson, a former secretary of the FPCC, for allegedly infiltrating the international revolutionary movement. The CIA bought up copies for a PSYCH OP. Several documents from 1998 discuss pending issues before the ARRB (JFK Board) regarding the release of JFK assassination-related records, focusing on protecting sensitive Agency equities and operational details. These documents identify Gibson as a CIA asset and mention the protection of his identity and related files as a point of negotiation between the CIA and the ARRB.",

  "significance": "Richard Gibson's significance in the JFK assassination context lies in his alleged connections to Lee Harvey Oswald, his former role as secretary of the FPCC, and his later identification as a CIA asset. The CIA's concern over protecting his identity and files during the ARRB review suggests that he may have had some involvement or knowledge relevant to the assassination, though the exact nature of his role remains unclear from these documents alone.",
