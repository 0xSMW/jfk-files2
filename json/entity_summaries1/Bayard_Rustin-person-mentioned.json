  "summary": "Bayard Rustin is mentioned in documents primarily concerning FBI investigations into Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley Levison. The documents, largely consisting of memoranda summarizing the testimony of retired FBI Special Agent Alan G. Sentinella before the Senate Select Committee (SSC), focus on electronic surveillance, potential communist influence, and the FBI's operational policies regarding these individuals and organizations. While Rustin is mentioned in these contexts, the documents do not provide specific details about his direct involvement or activities. His name appears alongside those of King, Levison, and the SCLC, suggesting a connection within the civil rights movement that drew the attention of the FBI during this period.",
