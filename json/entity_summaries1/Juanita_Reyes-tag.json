  "summary": "Juanita Reyes is identified as a character reference for Manuel Marti in November 1968. Several attempts were made by agents to contact her to verify information about Marti. These attempts included checking telephone directories, visiting her listed address in the Bronx, New York, and contacting her residences. Initial efforts to contact her were unsuccessful, as she no longer resided at the provided address and was reported to have returned to Puerto Rico. Eventually, contact was made, and Reyes stated that she did not know Manuel Marti. The documents consistently portray Reyes as a potential source of information about Manuel Marti, but ultimately, she denies any association with him.",
