  "summary": "Eileen M. Wukitch is a person mentioned in several documents related to the JFK assassination records. Her specific role is not explicitly defined, but she appears to be involved in the process of document review and release, as indicated by a note from J. Barry Harrelson regarding issues for a May meeting, including concerns about document releases, Australian liaison documents, and state cover documents. The documents span from 1978 to 1998, with a concentration in 1997-1998, suggesting her involvement was most active during the ARRB's efforts to declassify and release JFK assassination records. The pattern across the documents suggests she was a point of contact or participant in discussions related to the handling and release of sensitive information.",
