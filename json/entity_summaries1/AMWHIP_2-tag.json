AMWHIP/2 is also mentioned in connection with AMWEST/2 and a trip to PBRUMEN to contact a military friend. The documents do not explicitly define the role or identity of AMWHIP/2, but the context implies involvement in intelligence activities or as a contact within a network. The timeline of involvement spans from at least June 1965 to March 1966, based on the document dates.",
