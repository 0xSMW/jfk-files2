[ON FILE IN THE CIA LIBRARY is a copy, in Spanish, of the Frente Interno
de Unidad Revolucionaria - FIUR.]

1. A Cuban exile, Julio V. Leal, residing at 4823 East 8th Court, Hialeah,
Florida, claims to be the US Delegate of the "Cuban Government in Arms".
He also claims that he received a copy of a proclamation prepared by
members of the FIUR, in Cuba, and was authorized to release it to
publicity sources. He provided me with a copy of the FIUR declaration.
[See On File Material.]

2. On 25 Apr 63 Leal furnished me with a copy of a document, in Spanish,
which showed the appointments to executive and cabinet posts of the
Provisional Government of the Republic of Cuba in Arms. The names are:

President To be announced at a later date for reasons of security.
Vice-President Dr Gustavo Cuerve Rubio
Premier Dr Jose Manuel Gutierrez
Secretary to the President To be announced at a leter date.
Minister of State Dr Carlos Prie Socarras
Minister of Communications - Luis Conte Aguero

Minister of Agriculture Now in Cuba, name not revealed for security
reasons.
Minister of Public Housing - To be announced at a later date.

The following individuals have been named Ministers without portfolio and
subsecretaries:
Jose Ignacio Rivero
Manuel Reyes
Jorge Castellanos
Lauraeano Batista Falla
Agusto Fernandez Conde
Juan Manuel Salvat
Humberte Medrano.
Fermin Peinado
Melchor Gaston
Manuel Fernandez
Enrique Huertas

Designated Ambassador to Washington - Dr Guillermo Belt

OAS Delegate Dr Herminio Portell Vila

3. I doubt that Leal has been designated as the US representative for FIUR,
and do not believe that the documents he gave me originated in Cuba. I
suspect that another group of exiled Cuban politicians wrote the document
in the US, and are trying to get national publicity in order to get support.
I have recently heard that Eloy Gutierrez menoyo has been added to the list
of Cabinet appointments. I doubt very much that Gutierrez and Ray would be
fully accepted by the majority of Cubans in exile.
