MEMORANDUM FOR: Lee H. Wigren

VIA: Head of Career Service

FROM: B. DeFelice
	 Acting Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Retirement Planning

1. In order to assist employees in planning for their
eventual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to
inform each employee, well in advance of retirement, of
the services the Agency provides for retirement planning.

2. The prospect of retirement deserves serious thought
and careful planning so that you may make the transition to
the next phase of life with purpose and confidence. To as-
sist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources
which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You
will, in the future, be invited by a Retirement Counselor to
an individual pre-retirement counseling session, or more than
one if you wish. This phase of retirement planning will be
tailored solely to your own particular situation and circum-
stances and will be within the context of the retirement
system under which you will retire. The individual counseling
sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information
on such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor bene-
fits, life and health-insurance, Social_Security, taxes, and
assistance in obtaining other employment. In addition, you
will-he-imvited-to-attend_a_Retirement Information Seminar
that will be offered in the autumn of 1978.

3. Experience has amply demonstrated that advance
preparation eases the transition to retirement. I recom-
mend, strongly, that you avail yourself of the services the
Agency offers you in planning your own retirement.

to Messrs. Raymond Rocca, William Decker, William Donnelly, John Bogart,
Joseph Flaherty, Lee Wigren, Robert Thomas and Paul Johnson, all members
of your staff, for their outstanding participation and support of our
new "Soviet Intelligence Elective Seminar." This seminar provided an
in-depth examination of the Soviet Intelligence and Security Services

Degree Program in Strategic Intelligence.

(U) Each Agency participant displayed a thorough knowledge of the subject
Interlaced with personal experiences and analyses which made each presen-
tation unique and extremely valuable for the seminar members, In addition
to the participants' formal presentations, they also spent valuable time
informally talking with individual members of the seminar and faculty.
Our students and faculty were enthusiastic in their praise of all aspects
for the program; and they especially appreciated the candid discussions of
the problems Soviet intelligence poses both for the Agency and the Intel-
ligence Community. Please convey to each participant our sincere thanks
for his outstanding presentation and his interest in the School's Graduate
Program.

(U) Your continued cooperation in assisting this School to educate students
whose intelligence capabilities will be an asset to the servicea and
Intelligence Community is deeply appreciated
Sincerely,
