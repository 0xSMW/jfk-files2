BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT PROGRESS OF THE PARTY HAS GOOD. HE SAID THAT AFTER HE HAD WRITTEN ARTICLES, MADE SPEECHES, AND DELIVERED LECTURES ON THE ARCHITECTURAL AESTHETICAL SYMMETRY, HE GRADUALLY RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS A SERIOUS TARGET FOR DEFORMATION. HE SAID "I WAS DOWNHEARTED. I HAD NO QUARREL WITH THE PARTY. I WAS SURE I WAS BEING ENCOURAGED TO OBJECTIVISM BECAUSE MY ARCHITECTURAL THINKING DID NOT FIT INTO THE NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. MY PATIENCE HAD BEEN AS THAT OF A CHILD BEING REPRESSED BY ITS MOTHER, BUT BECAUSE I EMBRACED OUR PARTY AS MUCH AS I HAD EMBRACED MY MOTHER, THE PARTY, HOWEVER, WAS VERY PATIENT WITH ME. AFTER I CALL SERIOUSLY OUT MYSELF, I ADVANCED IN AGREEMENT." HE SAID: "I WAS A FRODIGAL SON. AFTER SELF EXAMINATION, I WILL NEVER LEAVE OUR PARTY _ NOT EVEN A STEP AWAY FROM IT."
