Re Tampa airtel to Director, FBI, dated 11/4/66.

Enclosed for the Tampa and Miami Offices are
two photographs each of CARLOS MARCELLO. It is noted
that both these photographs are excellent likenesses of
CARLOS MARCELLO.

Tampa requested to show photo of CARLOS MARCELLO
to TP 120-C and other sources familiar with TRAFFICANTE'S
associates.

Tampa requested not to make any inquiry of any
informant relative to the visit of CARLOS and JOSEPH
MARCELLO and their respective wives, as is Miami, due to
the fact that this would immediately identify the in-
formant who furnished this information.

Tampa and Miami requested to show CARLOS MARCELLO's
photo only to logical informants, including TP 120-C.
