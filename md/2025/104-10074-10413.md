MEXCO
1. On 8 December 1960 Jose Xavier CORTES Hernandez who represents himself as a priest told Jose Antonio PORTUONDO Valdor, Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, that he had information that "the thing they were working on" had gotten underway and had produced a tremendous reaction in Cuba. He said that a friend, who is Roman Catholic but very liberal, had returned from a visit to Cuba, where he said the Knights of Columbus were pretty well entrenched. For this reason, CORTES said he felt it would be necessary to "take the bull by the horns" and begin things or the Knights of Columbus would gain the advantage.

2. PORTUONDO said that the bombing of the church of Father BOZA in Cuba had definitely been an act of "auto-agression" and was clumsily done. He said a red flag with hammer and sickle was found in the debris. PORTUONDO told CORTES that-Carlos OLIVARES, Under-secretary of Foreign Affairs, had not gaid any- thing, but, since he, PORTUONDO, was going to Cuba at the end of December, he believed that OLIVARES would wait until his visit: 3

3. CORTES said that he would like to go to Cuba and see for himself how things were going.

Field Comments

1. According to an untested bource in the Roman Catholic Church, CORTES Hernandez vas never a priest. It was previously reported that Atisbos, Mexico City newspaper, had reported that CORTES was a Catholic priest and a member of the Jesuit onder until 1950 when he left the order because of his "rebellious and anarchic spirit".

2. It is believed that CORTES Hernandez, who belongs to a schismatic Catholic. church, called the Mexican Apostolic Catholic Church, is interested. in establishing a schismatic church in Cuba.

3. Source Comment. PORTUONDQ's remark about OLIVARES came after he and CORTES had been discussing German Lence, Castrista priest who has been stopped by episcopal sanction from his ministry in Oriente province.
