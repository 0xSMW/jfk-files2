SECRETS OF THE CIA!!!
American Mata Hari Who Duped Castro

Marie Lorenz: spied on Fidel.

Its clandestine operations now undergoing someimes painful official
scrutiny, the Central Intelligence Agency maintains, as always, a tight lip. But
from interviews with the agents who carried out the CIA's clock-and-dagger
work, News reporter Paul Meskil tells here for the first time of the intrigue
that surfaced in the Cuban missile crisis, a confrontation that pushed the US
to the brink of war with the Soviet Union. First of a series.

She spoke German and English,
which she had learned from her Ameri-

About two weeks later, two Cuban
officers called on Marie in New York.
They carried a message from Castro,
saying he was in desperate need of an
English-German translator. He had sent
a Cubana Airlines plane to bring her
back to Havana.
"I made a big mistake," Marie said.,
"I got on that plane."
During the flight to Havana, she
tried to imagine her life in Castroland.

but nothing happened.
"The only clothes I had were what I
brought with me from New York. I
couldn't go out to buy anything. Fidel
had me measured for a uniform so 1

of July Movement. An olive-green uni-
form with a lieutenant's star.
"That way, when I was allowed out

almost every Havana housewife heard
rumors that Castro was keeping a for-
eigner, an American girl, at the fiilton.
I was becoming a problem to him.

where dictator Fulgencio Batista had
imprisoned Fidel and Raol (Fidel's
brother) years before. I went into the
rell to look at a bronze plaque on the
wall. They shut the door and locked me
in the coll. Then they went away.
She Wasn't Pampered
"I spent a week there, eating the
same food as the other prisoners
blacks beans, rice, stale bread and cof-
fee. As far as I know, I was the only
woman there.
"Every morning we would hear the
firing squads. As soon as it got light,
the birds would start singing. Then the
guns would go off. Then marching and
quiet. Then breakfast and cell checks.
The guards would check to see if you'd
hanged yourself during the night or if
you'd done something wro wrong in there
where there was hardly room to turn
around. It was hourible.
"After seven days, I was taken out
and flown back to Havana."
Mevin was never told why she was
jailed. She now believes Castro had her
locked up to make sure she didn't es-
cape while he was out of the count v
visiting the United States and South
Anterica.
One night she was with Castro, and
his bodyguards 111 the lobby of the
Riviera Hotel when a handsome, wav-
haared man aproached her. He wore
the olive-green rehel uniform and the
msignia of a captain m the Cuban Bir
force.
While Castro was conferring with
his sides on the other side of the
lobby, the captain mingled with the
barbudos around Marie and whispered
to her in English: "I know about you."
"Can you help me?" she responded.
"can you get me out of here?"
"Yes. I'm with the American
Embassy. I'll get you out."
This was her introduction to Com-
mandante Frank Fiorini (later known
as Frank Sturgis), Castro confidant
and hired agent for the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency.

Agrees to Spy on Fidel
For the next few weeks Frank kept
in contact with her in person and
through Castro officers who were
working for him. Marie agreed to spy
on Castro. She filched secret documenta
and reported Castro's conversations
with important visitors overheard
through the hotel, walls. Ily now, she
could read and speak Spanish fairly
well.
Thee kuite was full of guns and
papers," she said. "Fidel had papers
atrewn all over the tables, the floor,
the bed, the dresser. He had one filing
cabinet that was never locked. It was
full of money, papers, documents,
maps. I took papers out and slipped
them to Frank. Fidel never missed
them.
"Frank said, 'Get all the data you
can, and I did. I was a regular Mata.
Hari."
Then Marie became sick, and Frank
arranged her escape. Two Cuban offi-
cers took her out of the hotel while
Castro was away and put her on a
Cubana Airlines flight to New York.
i
About that time, Frank also set up
the escapes of two top Cuban air force
officers, a project that forced him to
leave Cuba. He moved his luse of
operations to Miami, bat he kept in
touch with his agents on the island and
his CIA contacta in Havana and Wash-
ington.
When she recovered from her ill-
ness, Marie jo ned him in Florida and
volunteered for a mission that meant
certain death if show were caught.
