SUBJECT: SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR., aka
ANTI-RACKETEERING

Reference Havana letter dated June 10, 1959.

HAV-33 advised on June 15, 1959, that both the subject
and HENRY SAAVEDRA, who represented subject's interests in the
Hotel Capri, continue to be detained by Cuban police. Source
said it appeared that subject and SAAVEDRA might be deported
from Cuba in the near future.

On June 29, 1959, HAV-33 informed that TRAFFICANTE
was temporarily released from jail on June 21, 1959, in order
to attend his daughter's wedding at the Hotel Havana-Hilton.
Source said that TRAFFICANTE appeared at the hotel in the company
of representatives of the Cuban Ministry of Justice and the
Cuban Secret Police. Source noted that several hundred people
attended the wedding celebration at the Hotel Hilton and that
most of these individuals were persons employed by the gambling
casinos in the Havana area. Source said that Miami Top Hoodlum,
JACKALONE, and Boston Top Hoodlum, JOHN WILLIAMS, were observed
at the wedding celebration.

On July 1, 1959, PCI Arthur Newman (conceal), Credit
Manager of the gambling casino at the Hotel Nacional, advised that
the majority of the persons in attendance at the wedding of
subject's daughter were individuals employed in the gambling
casinos in Havana. Source noted there was only one small group
of persons comprising TRAFFICANTE's immediate family and close
friends in Tampa, who came from the United States to be present
at the wedding. Source noted that most of the hoodlums in the
United States are well aware that police authorities would be
on the look-out for individuals possibly attending the wedding
of TRAFFICANTE's daughter in Havana and for that reason many
hoodlums who might have attended stayed in the United States.
