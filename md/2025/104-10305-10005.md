ALLEGATION:	CIA CONNECTION:

Richard Case NAGELL, "a 	None; although, Subject was of
highly decorated infantry	interest to OS in 1964 and early
Captain in the Korean War", 	1965 because of information
alleges that he became a 	furnished to the Agency by the
CIA agent. He said he	FBI that he had in his possession
fired the gun in the bank at	the names of six CIA employees
El Paso, Texas because he	at the time of his arrest for bank
wanted to be in custody when	robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20
the assassination of	September 1963.
President KENNEDY took
place. NAGELL charged
that "the FBI illegally
seized from him evidence
crucial to his defense,
such as notebooks containing
the names of certain CIA
employees, photographs, two
Mexican tourist cards (one
in the name of Joseph KRAMER,
the other in the name of
Albert HIDEL) and receipts for
registered mail, including the one
for the letter sent HOOVER
warning of the assassination.
NAGELL daimed he was in-
structed to "arrow" the
patsy, that is kill him
(OSWALD) after the assassi-
nation. He contended he
got cold feet and this was
his reason for the attempted
bank robbery, he would rather
be arrested than commit
murder and treason. The
article alleges that while it
was suggested in court that
an airplane crash NAGELL
survived mentally affected him,
he was given intelligence
training after the crash.
Also, NAGELL complains he has
been salted away because of
what he knows.

1968 RAMPARTS
Article by William
W. TURNER

OS INDICES RESULTS:

Subject became of interest to the Office of Security in March 1964
when the FBI informed the Agency that Subject had in his possession at
the time of his arest for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September
1963 the name of Richard FECTEAU (an individual by this name was captured
by the Chinese Communists and is now in prison in China) and of six Agency
employees. Research failed to reveal any reason why NAGELL had these
names in his possession. It was concluded that while NAGELL is unquestionably
unbalanced, his story of being involved in espionage is not fully contradicted
by evidence. He could have been contacted by a Soviet agent while in Washington,
D. C. in December 1962 or while he was in Mexico City in September and October
1962. His file contains mostly FBI reports dated 1962 and 1964 and in these
are documented his history of mental instability and physical complaints
stemming from the plam crash. Attached is a chronology dated 3 March 1965
made from the information contained in the FBI reports. At the time this
security research was conducted, it was recommended that NAGELL be personally
interviewed by a representative of OS in the hope that NAGELL might reveal
how he came into the possession/ these names but no further action is indicated
in his file and this interview was not undertaken.

DETAILS:

Subject's file reflects no Agency interest in him prior to March 1964
when the names of CIA employees were found in his possession when arrested
for bank robbery.

The RAMPARTS claim that he received intelligence training after the plane
crash is true. The crash occurred 28 November 1954 and he graduated from
Army Intelligence School, Ft. Holabird, Maryland on 15 August 1955. ะะต
served in Korea and Japan as a member of the U. S. Army Counterintelligence
Corps, terminating about 1958. A Lt. Col. Ned W. GLENN who served with
NAGELL personally in Korea advised that NAGELL was not stable mentally and
that this instability was probably due to brain damage suffered in the airplane
crash.

The RAMPARTS article's claim that NAGELL said he fired the gun in the
bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination
took place is not completely in conflict with a statement NAGELL made on
1 January 1964 which was, however, after the assassination. (see page 4 of
chronology)

The RAMPARTS article's allegation that the FBI took from NAGELL a note-
book containing the names of CIA employees is true.

NAGELL's complaint that he was "salted away" is open to speculation. A
ten year prison sentence does appear harsh, considering the documented brain

damage he suffered in the B-25 plane crash while he was in the U. S.
Army.

24 Jan 1963:	Asked FBI in Miami if his Cuban or Russian sources
	gave him a pistol with silencer and microfilm if he
	would be permitted to return same to his contact so
	he could be of further use to U.S. Government. He
	stated that in August or September 1962 he met a man
	from Maryland in Mexico City who introduced him to
	individuals whom he believed may have been Soviet Agent.

19 April 1963:	Advised FBI in Los Angeles, California, that he had
	taken his former wife to court for failure to comply with
	court order giving NAGELL visitation rights with children.

4 June 1963:	NAGELL appeared at the Out Patient Clinic and was re-
	ferred to the Neurological Clinic for treatment. His
	condition was diagnosed as'depression, tearful, nervous,
	rigid". Would only utter words "Got to see my kids".

20 Sept 1963:	NAGELL arrested in El Paso, Texas, on charge of at-
	tempting to rob State National Bank. Slashed wrist night
	of 9/20/63. NAGELL consistently denied he had tried
	to rob the bank; stated that the fact that he fired two shots
	in the ceiling proved he had not been trying to hit anyone.
	He stated that he was certain that "all of my problems have
	been solved for a long time, and now I won't have to go to
	Cuba!".
	A notebook which the Subject had on his person when ar-
	rested made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
	the names of purported CIA agents and other information.
	Cell mate in jail reported that NAGELL disclosed to him
	that NAGELL, during confused period after discharge,
	decided everything against him in Los Angeles and made
	arrangements with Communist Party in Los Angeles to
	pick up visa and passport from contact in El Paso and
	eventually end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELL reportedly
	attempted suicide three times enroute to El Passo but
	lost nerve.

(Noteworthy that State Department records reflect issuance
of Passport to NAGELL on 7 August 1962 at Los Angeles,
California, and that on 9 July 1963 NAGELL signed affi-
davit that his passport had been lost or stolen. He was
issued a new passport on 6 August 1963.)

4 Nov 1963:	El Paso Herald-Post article states that NAGELL told
	U.S. District Court that he did not attempt to hold up
	the bank. "I had a motive for doing what I did!" NAGELL
	told Judge, "but my motive was not to hold up the bank.
	I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time."

19 Dec 1963:	Subsequent to President's assassination, Subject claimed
	acquaintance with OSWALD and wife. Marina OSWALD
	on 1/18/65 disclaimed any knowledge of NAGELL.

1 Jan 1964:	NAGELL furnished a signed statement:
	"... In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City,a
	representative of a foreign government preposed to me
	that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal
	offense and inimical to the best interest of the United
	States. At that time, I refused such proposal. In May
	1963, another representative of the same foreign govern-
	ment made the same proposal to me. At that time, I
	agreed to such a proposal."
	"In September 1963, I was informed by an American,
	known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government,
	that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned
	act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid
	proposal.
	Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this
	same person to either participate as previously agreed
	or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be
	disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-
	upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person,
	although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation
	actuated my conduct of September 20, 1963, for which I
	was arrested and am presently charged.
	I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I thought that
	my arrest would provide an immediate, though temporary,
	solution to the problem with which I was confronted.
	I am not guilty as charged.!"

24 Jan 1964:	NAGELL arraigned in connection with indictment for
	bank robbery and was committed for 30 days for the
	purpose of psychiatric examination.

9 June 1964:	Sentenced in U.S. District Court, El Paso, Texas to
	serve 10 years.

17 June 1964:	NAGELL swallowed several sleeping pills while lodged
	at the El Paso County Jail.

in that name as confirmation (Report,
p. 315). Garland G. Slack and other

Slack's displeasure by firing on his tar-

An incident at Downtown Lincoln-
Mercury is highly revealing. Immedi-
ately after the assassination, salesman
Albert Guy Bogard reported to the FBI
that a man giving the name Lee Oswald,
who closely resembled the accused as-
sassin, came into the showroom on No-
vember 9. Remarking that in several
weeks he would have the money to make
the purchase, he test-drove an expensive
model on the Stemmons Freeway at 60
to 70 miles an hour. Both Bogard and
another salesman, Oren Brown, wrote
down the name Oswald so that they
would remember him if he called back.
A third salesman, Eugene M. Wilson,
recalled that when the man purporting
to be Oswald was told he would need a
credit rating, he snapped, "Maybe I'm

Given a lie detector test by the FBI,
Bogard's responses were those "normally
expected of a person telling the truth."
Nevertheless, the Warren Commission
dismissed the incident by noting that
Oswald supposedly could not operate an
automobile and that on November 9 he
allegedly spent the day drafting a
lengthy letter to the Soviet Embassy. It
evidently never considered the possibility
someone might be impersonating Os-
wald. But Bogard will never identify the
impersonator. He stuck to his story in
news interviews, and subsequently was
beaten to within an inch of his life by an
unknown assailant and arrested by the
Dallas police on seemingly trumped-up
bad check charges. He retreated to his
native Louisiana, where on St. Valen-
tine's Day 1966, he was found dead of
exhaust fumes in his automobile.

The main ingredients of the patsy
theory are wrapped up in a story that has
gradually filtered out of Leavenworth
Penitentiary. The story is that of inmate
Richard Case Nagell, and paradoxically,
the most cogent confirmation for it is the
manner in which he wound up sentenced
to ten years in federal custody.

Nagell was a highly decorated infantry
captain in the Korean War who, he
claims, subsequently became a CIA
agent. It is a matter of record that in
1957 he was seriously injured in a plane
crash in Cambodia, which tends to sup-
port his contention, since Cambodia was
not exactly a tourist playground. On
September 20, 1963, Nagell walked into
a bank in El Paso, Texas, fired a gun into
the ceiling, and then sat outside waiting
to be arrested. He says he staged the
affair because he wanted to be in custody
as an alibi when the assassination took
place. It was a desperate measure, he ad-
mits. But he had sent a registered letter
to J. Edgar Hoover warning him of the
impending assassination, which he says
was then scheduled for the latter part of
September (probably the 26th in Wash-
ington, D.C.), and the letter had gone
unanswered.

There is an incredibly brief FBI inter-
view report stating, in part, that on De-
cember 19, 1963, Nagell advised, "For
the record he would like to say that his
association with OSWALD (meaning
LEE HARVEY OSWALD) was purely
social and that he had met him in Mexico

repor states that when the prisoner was
being led from court on January 24,
1964, he "made wild accusations to news-
paper reporters, accusing the FBI of not
attempting to prevent the assassination
of President Kennedy..." (CD 404).

That the charges may not be so wild is
indicated by the fact that the government
threw the book at Nagell, a first offender
who says he expected to be charged only
with discharging a firearm on govern-
ment-protected property. Since his sen-
tencing, he has been shuttled between
Leavenworth and the federal medical
center (a euphemism for mental institu-
tion) at Springfield, Missouri. While the
government has suggested in court that
his airplane crash mentally affected
Nagell, the fact remains that he was
given intelligence training after the crash.
What Nagell alleges is damning not only
to the FBI, but to the CIA. In brief,
he says that the motive for the assassina-
tion was Kennedy's move in the direction
of a rapprochement with Castro, which
was a rank, betrayal in the eyes of
anti-Castro elements. As he puts it, an
anti-Castro group in New Orleans and
Mexico City, code name Bravo Club,
decided to give Kennedy a "Christmas.
present" to be delivered September 26, a
date that was postponed. A party was
required. Two members of Bravo Club
approached Oswald while he was work-
ing at the Reily coffee firm in New Or-
leans in the summer of 1963, and ap-
pealed to his ego in setting him up as the
patsy. When the "delivery" site was
shifted to Dallas, Bravo Club enlisted
the aid of a Dallas "subsidiary," Delta
Club.

Meanwhile the CIA got wind of the
plans and sent several agents into the
field to ascertain whether they were "for
real." Nagell says he was one of the
agents dispatched. Within a short time,
he claims, he was pulled in. It had been
verified that the plans were authentic,
that "gusanos [anti-Castroites] were
making the watch tick," and that the
sum of the plot was right-wing in nature.
Nagell says that he was instructed to
"arrow" the patsy, that is kill him, after
the assassination. At this point, he con-
tends, he got cold feet and bailed out. "I
would rather be arrested than commit
murder and treason," he declared in a
self-prepared petition for habeas corpus.
In the petition, Nagell asserts that he
used the pseudonyms Robert Nolan and
Joseph Kramer in the U.S. and three

foreign countries under the authorization
of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He
states that the files of the FBI and the
CIA contain information that Oswald
was using the aliases Albert Hidel and
Aleksei Hidel. He charges that the FBI
illegally seized from him evidence crucial
to his defense, such as notebooks con-
taining the names of certain CIA em-
ployees, photographs, two Mexican
tourist cards (one in the name Joseph
Kramer, the other in the name Albert
Hidel), and receipts for registered mail,
including the one for the letter sent
Hoover warning of the assassination.
When Nagell complains he has been
"salted away" because of what he
knows, he just might be making the un-
derstatement of the year.

[THE ELIMINATION OF A PATSY]

DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY... I'm just
a patsy," Oswald shouted to news-
men while in police custody. A
marked patsy, contends Garrison-one
who was not supposed to have lived long
enough to utter his cry of innocence. But
something had misfired, and. Oswald fell
not into the hands of his would-be exe-
cutioners, but into the comparative
safety of the Dallas jail. The denouement
presented a crisis that the conspirators
could solve only by pressing police buff
Jack Ruby into service.

Although the Warren Commission
concluded that Oswald ducked into his
Oak Cliff rooming house to pick up the
.38 revolver, later confiscated from him
in the Texas Theater, it did not explain
why, if he had gone to work at the School
Book Depository that morning intend-
ing to kill the President and escape,
he did not take the revolver with him.
That he made a
