NOTE:

In 1954 a procedure was approved whereby we could
attribute certain information received from CIA under the
symbol "Bureau Informant 100." CIA forwards this information
utilizing an SP (Special Projects) number. They are asking
our concurrence in a method of addressing and forwarding
this material. They also suggested forwarding (SCOPE) material(5)
(sensitive information concerning ( Ksraeli intelligence
activities in the same manner. They proposed to forward
this material by courier in sealed envelopes to be delivered to
Liaison Section Supervisor D. J. Brennan, Jr. It is felt this
is the best way in which this highly sensitive material can be
handled.
