SUBJECT : E.O. 11652--Richard D. Mahoney (E 76-124)
REFERENCES :
A. Initial Request dated 8 January 1976.
B. GSA Referral Letter w/att. dated 19 April 1976.
C. IPS Reply dated 26 July 1976.
D. Appeal Letter dated 15 August 1976.

1. Summary of Recommendations: Sustain the initial determination to deny the document in toto under provision 5(B)(2) of E.O. 11652, as amended. Add provision 5(B)(3)
2. Background:
a. On 8 January 1976, Mr. Richard D. Mahoney requested a mandatory review of two classified CIA documents under provisions of Executive Order 11652 Section 5(C). The documents were in custody of the National Archives and Records Service (NARS) in the John F. Kennedy Library.
b. On 19 April 1976, the NARS referred Mr. Mahoney's request with copies of the documents to CIA. The Agency was asked to review the documents. If declassified, they were to be marked appropriately.

If they remained classified, the Agency was requested to cite the applicable exemption category from Section 5(B) of the E.O. and a date when automatic declassification may be accomplished. They requested that the copies of the documents be returned with the Agency's response.
c. On 26 July 1976, IPS wrote to the NARS and returned copies of the documents. Both documents were found to require continued classification under 6.0. 11652 Section 5(B). However, a sanitized version of Item I was found possible and was enclosed. NARS could advise requester of his right to appeal directly to CIA.
d. On 15 August 1976, Mr. Mahoney wrote to the CIA and appealed the decision to withhold from declassification Item #2 of his request.

3. Recommendations:
a. Tab B-2 contains TDCSDB 3/657,851 dated 12 November 1963. During the initial review, the document was denied in toto to requester under provision 5(B) (2) of E.O. 11652, as amended. The document is based on ACL-1832 dated 10 November 1963. I recommend that the initial determination to deny the document to the requester in toto under provision 5(B)(2) of E.O. 11652, as amended, be sustained and that provision S(B)(3) of E.ÎŸ. 11652 now be applied. The information is from a sensitive source with unique access to a political leader. If released, the information could cause embarrassment to the United States Government and exacerbate relations with a friendly foreign government.

b. During the DDO appeals review, a classification review was conducted. The document is properly classified and properly marked in accordance with the provisions of E.O. 11652, as amended. Due to the sensitivity of the subject matter, a meaningful sanitization cannot be made.

Dear Sir:
Under the provisions of Executive Order 11652 section 5 subsection (C), I would like to appeal your decision which led to the denial of document 2 OF NOK-76-260.

Since I do not have an idea concerning the nature of the document, an only address my appeal to the general position that the change of governmental policies, the relinquishment of its African territories etc. alleviate the sensitivity of this document would the document be released in sanitized form?
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

REFERENCE :
A. Initial Request from NARS dated
10 May 1976 with attachments.
B. IPS Reply to NARS dated 24 June
1976.
C. Appeal Letter, 23 September 1976.

1. Summary of Recommendations: Sustain the initial determination to deny in tofo TOCSDB-5/656,740, an intelligence report originated by Paris Station dated 19 September 1953 under exemption 5(B)(2) of Executive Order (E.0.) 11652, and add the claim of 5(B) (3) OF E.O. 11652.
2. Background:
a. Richard Doyle Mahoney, a membe member of the the public who is identified as a researcher, initiated on 8 January 1975 through the John F. Kennedy Library a mandatory review of TDCSDB-5/656,740 98 accordance with the provisions of E.O. 11652, Section 5(C). The request for review was forwarded to IPS via the National Archives and Records Service (NARS) on 10 May 1976.
b. IPS responded to HARS on 24 June 1976. Among other things, CIA denied in toto TOCSDE- 3/656,740, which was Itea 8a on the NARS request, ou the ground of Section 5(B) (2) of E.O. 11652. The

E2 INPOET CL BY 012170

reply stated that the document had to remain Classified indefinitely in order to protect intelligence sources and methods, and stated that release of segregable portions was not feasible. This was based upon a classification review by a knowledgeable officer with experience in French-African affairs, dated 24 May 1976.
c. Mr. Richard Doyle Mahoney appealed this determination directly to IPS in a letter dated 22 September 1976. He specifically asked if it would not be possible to release a sanitized version of the document without jeopardizing national security.
3. Recommendations:
a. See the Appeals Review Forms for specific detailed recommendations.
b. A second classification review was requested by DDO/ISS/PICG. The second review was conducted on TDCSDB-3/656,740 on 22 December 1976 by Europe Division, which decided to retain the classification at Secret in accordance with E.O. 11652. Europe Division determined after review that there were foreign policy and liaison sensitivities which precluded downgrading TDCSDB-3/656,740, or sterilizing the document and releasing portions thereof, at this time. Specifically the report describes in a critical and subjective way various French governmental entities and French personalities living and dead. The knowledge by the current French government that this particular information, or general information of this same type, had been circulated at high levels of the U.S. government would be detrimental to current U.S./French foreign relations. Further, one of the individuals mentioned is a former French intelligence operative and cabinet officer. Relations with the French liaison services are presently reasonably good, and disclosure of information of this sort would undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on future U.S. relations with French liaison services, as well as a probable spill-over effect on U.S./French foreign relations.

urope Division determined that it eas also necessary to protect sotoces ud mo. The source is currently active, and access to information in the docement about the French security service was sufficiently limited tomt current disclosure of that information to in fact he likely to point the Finger of suspicion at a relatively small group of potential sources one of whom is source. Failure to protect
this source would in turn jeopardize CIA relations with corrent and future sottrees.
d. The undersigned appeals and litigation Officer agrees with this position.

1. Martin Webb, a St. Louis official of the Internal Revenue S-Service and an uncleared cont este this office, caked us for any Information we might have on the American Volunteers Organization Council and, specifically, any information we might have concerning its reputation, bona fides, etc. This call was stilated by an inquiry from John Mavrakos, 15 Fair Oaks, Clayton, Missouri, a wealthy St. Louis candy manufacturer with offices at 4711 Delar Blvd., St. Louis, Mo. Mavrakos is of Greek carection and is an uncleared and inactive source of this office.
2. Mavrakos has apparently been asked to contribute charitable donations to the American Volunteers Organization Cancil, which in turn distributes funds in Greece for unknown purposes. Kavrakos attempted to locate the address of the American Volunteers Organization Council, which he bed been told was in Bev York, without any success. Be thereupon phoned the St. Louis Internal Revenue office about the matter.
3. Binco this exercise resembles an Agency funding operation we checked dla files irmoliately for correspondence on the aubject but found Ð¿Ð¾nÐµ. It is also conceivable that the may be a DO/P operation that did not pass through cur hands. Can you chock on the wetter?

2. Background:

a. On 22 July 1975, Ms. Elaine Fuller wrote to CIA and requested all and any information con- cerning her maintained by CIA under the FOIA. She provided some biographic information and asked that any fees be waived.
b. On 15 December 1975, IPS/DDA advised DDO that two documents concerning Ms. Fuller had been referred to CIA by the FBI.

c. On 19 March 1976, IPS wrote to Ms. Fuller and enclosed sanitized versions of four documents, three of which were DDO documents. Deletions had been made under (b) (1), (b) (3), and (b) (6) of the FOIA. Two additional DDO documents (those referred by the FBI) were denied in toto under the same exemptions. The exemptions were explained, the denying officials were identified by name, and Ms. Fuller was advised of her right to appeal. Ms. Fuller was also advised that FBI and INS ori- ginated material was being referred to the FBI and INS for their direct response to her request. [N.B. When IPS listed the four documents they erroneously listed the Deputy Director of Security as denying document 1 and Chief, Services Staff as responsible for documents 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. In fact, the Deputy Director of Security was the denying official of document 4 and Chief, Services Staff for documents 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. OGC should point out and correct this error in their letter to requester].
d. In an undated letter received by CIA on 26 April 1976, Ms. Fuller appealed the decisions pursuant to subsection (a) (6) of the FOIA.

3. Recommendations:
a. Tabs B-1 thru B-3, B-5, and B-6 contain the documents constituting the DDO appeals review. Please refer to these tabs for my recommendations concerning individual documents.

b. As stated in Paragraph :c above, I recommend that OGC, in their letter to requester, correct the previous error in identifying the deciding officials.

c. Document B-6 is a CSCI that transmits an accumulative machine listing to the FBI. This document is updated periodically and previous listings should be destroyed. Document B-5 is the updated and final machine listing for 1970 and superceded document B-6 which should have been destroyed. I recommend that OGC advise requester that document B-5 supercedes document B-6 and contained the exact sare information. I further recommend that IPS draw this matter to the attention of the FBI so future duplicate referrals may be avoided.
d. A classification review of the five documents listed in Tab B has been conducted. The documents are properly marked and properly classified in accordance with Executive Order 11652, as amended, All non-exempt information has been identified and recommended for release to requester.

e. The FBI and INS documents pertaining to Subject located in DDO files have been referred in writing to the respective agencies for their direct response to requester. (See Tab C).
4. Mr. Bill Ashbaugh of OGC has concurred in these recommendations.

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act as amended (SU.S.c. Cection 552).

Briefly, my request is for information that may be in your files pertaining to a U.S. paramilitary organization known variously as the American Volunteer Group, American Voluntary Guerrillas or Alternate Voluntary Government (all AVG).

As you know, the amended Freedom of Information Act provides that if some parts of a filÃ© are exempt from release, "reasonably segregable" portions shall be provided. I therefore request that, if you determine that some of the requested information is exempt, you provide me immediately with the information 1.hat can be made available. Of course, I reserve my right to appeal any such decisions pertaining to "exempt" material.

I am prepared to pay reasonable costs for locating this information.
