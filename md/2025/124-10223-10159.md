INSURGENT GROUP APPARENTLY ACTIVE IN
CUBA

An insurgent group known as the Cuban Revolutionary
Junta is apparently active inside Cuba according to clandestine
radio sources.

A broadcast on Monday morning, 30 August, from the
clandestine radiostation, "the Voice of the New Cuba," which
is apparently a part of the Cuban exile group, "Accion Sindical
Independiente" Independent Labor Action - ASI], the official
organ of the National Revolutionary Anti-Communist Front,
appealed to the Cuban people to try, in any way possible, to
get in touch with a member of the Cuban Revolutionary Junta.

Previously, this radio station transmitted instructions
to members of unidentified insurgent groups((A)).
