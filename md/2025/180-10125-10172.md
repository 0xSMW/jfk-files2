The latent fingerprint, which is present
on the lift on the card bearing the notation "off

The two latent fingerprints, which are
present on one lift on the card bearing the notation
"B - from inside outer edge of safe door," and the
inked fingerprints appearing in the two photographs
designated B and C in the Latent Fingerprint

The remaining latent fingerprint is not
identical with the inked fingerprints appearing in
the five submitted photographs.

The specimens are being retained in the
Latent Fingerprint Section until called for by a
