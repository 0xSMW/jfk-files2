RI COPY 7862-12

From: Chief of Station, Karachi Luk
Subject: GENERAL. Operational/INTEL

Date May 5, 1956

The station assumes that Headquarters
covered the meeting and can get access now or later to copies
of monographs, notes on proceedings, and so on.
2. The following items, keyed to the program, would seem to
be of interest to this station if Headquarters can get them:

A. On 3 April, Zakye Eglar: "The World View of the Punjabi Villager".
(Note: This is quite likely the East Punjabi,
but it should have some validity for Lahore as
well as for Delhi.)
B. On the same day, a Pakistan Studies Organization
Meeting was held at 1700. It would be useful to
know who is interested in Pakistan studies (both
individuals and organizations) and what lines
they are thinking of working on.

C. On 5 April, all the items of a "South Asian Mis-
cellany" should be of considerable interest,
particularly Stanley Maron's "The Future of East...
Bengal". 
Hydecker has some early drafts of the
Harold Isaacs study, but they are too early to
provide any useful material; this project (at
CENIS, MIT) is one that Headquarters should moni-
tor closely, however.

This report mentions that the study of Harold R. Isaacs is good to note.

SUBJECT: ISAACS, Harold Robert

1. Reference in made to the request received on
14 October 1963 from Lt. Whipple concerning Subject.
With respect to the specific questions posed in the
request, Subject is the author of a number of books,
including No Peace in Asia, Five Years of Kuomintang
Reaction, and The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution.
The files contain no information concerning Subject's
teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology;
however they do contain the following summary of un-
evaluated information based on several predecessor
organization reports. Additional information concern-
ing Subject is contained in our SODB 20568, dated 2
December 1949, subject: Harold Robert ISACCS, a copy
of which is attached for your retention.

a. Subject was omployed as a staff writer for
the Havas News Agency in Shanghai from 1930-1935.
He was also editor and publisher of the China Forum,
a communist periodical, from January 1932 to an
unspecified date. In July 1932 ISAACS wrote and
published the above-cited Five Years of Kuomintang
Reaction, a 136-page illustrated book of Communist
nature. While in Shanghai he was a member of The
Society of Friends of the USSR (Shanghai Branch)
and The China League for Civil Rights.

b. In 1933 Shanghai authorities listed Subject's
wife, Viola ROBINSON, as a suspect Soviet agent re-
siding in Shanghai. Prior to their marriage on 14
September 1932, ISAACS stated in a letter to Miss
ROBINSON that he had definitely turned "Red." All
the members of the ROBINSON family were described as
Communists.

he never accepted money from any group, that he was open and above
board, and that he never engaged in any conspiracies to overthrow
established government. They also indicated that Subject was
attracted to communism by sheer idealism. Immediately after Pearl

with the Conimunlaband began writing propaganda for the United
States Government.
5. According to Source of paragraph 2, Subject was a war
correspondent in China during World War II for Newsweek. In July
1945 he was refused entry into China by Chinese Nationalist authorities,

books, including No Peace in Asia and The Tragedy of the Chinese
