HUNGARIAN REACTION TO NEWS OF ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

FR Budapest: VILARULLO 25 Nov 63
TO Buenos Aires: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 67

The Hungarian press, television, and radio reported fully the
assassination of President KENNEDY, attributing it to fascist elements
and inspired by racial hatred. Despite the fact that [1 gr G]
emphasizes the grief and distress of all Hungary, none of the principal
government figures visited the United States Legation to present
personnel condolences and the text of the [1 gr G] telegram sent by
President DOBI was not published. Moreover, the Hungarian funeral
delegation, along with those from Romania and Czechoslovakia, was
of the lowest rank of the countries of this area, acting Foreign
Minister PETER MOD.

Finally while the government officials expressed restrained
grief, the people in general were deeply touched.
