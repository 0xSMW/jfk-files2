Gold suggested that they not resort to firearms, but that if he could be furnished with
some type of potent pill that could be placed in Castro's food or drink. Sam indicated
that he has a prospective nominee in the person of Juan Orta, a Cuban official, who had
been receiving back payments from the gambling interests who still had access to Castro,
and was in a financial bind. Cornelius Roosevelt, Chief, TSD was consulted and assigned
Dr. Raymond Treichler to develop a pill that had the elements of rapid solubility, high
lethal content, and little-or-no-traceability. Six of these items were produced-and-
after being checked out for their effectiveness by Dr. Edward M. Gunn, three pills were

OCCURRENCE:
The Special Group discussed (1) the possibility of providing sixty
thousand dollars from the Cuba budget to sponsor the religious activity of Father
Peyton in Cuba; (2) a proposal to survey the possibility of establishing a strike
base in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military
men to CIA. "Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700
Cubans is any longer practicable. He said that it had been his understanding that
the current thinking contemplated figures more on the order of 3,000." Mr. Barnes
replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as
a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as
3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed
it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in
addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

OCCURRENCE:
CARD 1 of 2
DR. EDWARD GUNN, Chief, Operations Division, Office of
Medical Services, has a notation that on 16 August 1960,
he received a box of Cuban cigars to be treated with a
lethal material. (21). He understood them to be CASTRO'S
favorite brand. (21). GUNN's notes show that within the
next month he contacted Ray Treichler, of TSD, (Sept. 6,
1960) and gave him the box of cigars (21). Treichlery
recalls "that he did contaminate a full box of 50 cigars
with Botulinum Toxin, a virulent poison," (21) which would
kill the intended victim upon merely putting it in the
mouth. Treichler's notes showed delivery of the box on
February 13, 1961, although they do not indicate to whom.

OCCURRENCE:

DESMOND FITZGERALD originated a scheme to assassinate CASTRO: "The idea
was to taken an unusually spectacular sea shell that would be certain to catch
CASTRO's eye, load it with an explosive trigger to blow when the shell was lifted,
and submerge it in an area where CASTRO often went skin diving." (77).
FITZGERALD explored this idea at several sessions with SAM HALPERN and OBRUCE
CHEEVER, but it was ultimately dismissed as impractical. (77).
DISCOVERY LEADS: Note: There is no indication that FITZGERALD told any-
one above him in the CIA hierarchy of this plan.

limited period through ARNOLD STEVER for the spotting of individuals with criminal and under-
world connections in Europe for possible multipurpose use, none of whom were ever advised of
the use. (50) Or were ever used.
When HARVEY-was-asked-if-the-multipurpose-use-included-assassination, he stated-that-i-f
he had ever been directly ordered to perform an assassination, he would have considered the
people spotted by Q.J. Win as possibilities. (50) He testified that before someone would have
actually been approached to carry out that operation, there would have been a long period of
assessment and cross checks. As far as he knew, the particular spotting mechanism never went
that far. So far as HARVEY could recallK.J.Win was used only once in connection with an opera-
Lion in the Congo, which was not an assassination operation. (51)

Harvey testified that his notes didnot cite assassination or assassination capability as
an objective of project Zrriffle. However, assassination was a contemplated purpose of the

The notes in Harvey's handwriting entitled Project Zrriffle state "3. Background:
In response to the increasing requirements for the operational procurement of foreign
code and cipher materials, division in 1960 began spotting of agent assets as-a-
developmental activity. During the same period requirements from NSA became more
refined and in many respects more sentative because most agencies are not equipped
to conduct this type of operation, and because of the desirability to completely centralize
control over this entire effort, it was determined that division d which was the closest
touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the activity. The spotting
activity has now advanced far enough to justify removing from the OOA category. (exhibit
