Agency (CIA).(U)

Swiss police recently located Hickman in Zurich,
Switzerland. Information was developed by the Swiss indicating that
subject allegedly was involved in business dealings relating to the
sale of arms to the Castro Government. With the collaboration of
Swiss authorities, a CIA representative interviewed subject on
11-27 and 28-59. The subject has been characterized as a
confidence operator and very unreliable. He claimed that he already
had volunteered information concerning his knowledge of activities
in Cuba to "friends of Senator Smathers." Hickman claimed that he
had been in contact with a Soviet Embassy representative, Bern,
Switzerland, in connection with a sale of Cuban sugar to Russia.
Hickman claimed that the Soviet had given him considerable encourage-
ment and indicated that the transaction would go through.
Soviet then suddenly told him that the deal was off.
The
Mrs. Roman stated that CIA does not plan to cover subject's
activities in the absence of a specific request from the Bureau.
