CONTACT REPORT
Agent - PACHANKIS
D/P/T: 20 Jan 75/ Fairfax Holiday Inn/rm 363/0830-0939

<S. Miguel Angel DIAZ Isalque: I showed P the letter from DIAZ to the
PO Box 982 Coral Gables box; P said he did not know that address and had no
idea how DIAZ might have got it. I told P it was a sensitive address which we
did not want to have blown, asked him to contact DIAZ, ostensibly because
KALBING (who long ago was having P prime DIAZ for a trip to Madrid, which
never came off) had sent regards and an explanation of why the Madrid thing
fell thru) P is to make no mention of the Coral Gables address or the letter,
but assuming DIAZ will bring it up, to try to discover how DIAZ got that address,
while also discovering what it is DIAZ had in mind when he wrote the letter.
P thinks he has DIAZ phone number, if necessary can use the ploy of having
seen DIAZ TV ad for his furniture store>

SUBJECT: Contact Report on Miguel Isalgue:
1. (Background). I)Os in a series of many important clandestine
fours during the early/mid 1960s put his life on the line many times Forus in
different assignments. In c. Oct 1963, How examined and approved by HS to become
an American citizen. He paid Court Fee and expected to be called shortly
thereefter for the Naturalization Court ceremony. To date,
he has not been naturalized and HS has refused according toJR
satisfactorily explain the cause JR for this
unusual delay. (Dasked us in c. Februry 1975 to help
determine the cause for the INS Delay? He has come back saying
he should make one more attempt with 11s before his would
check with her INS laison.)
2. On 21 and 27 March, i act with land informed him of
Was suggestion that he check once again with HS.
informs me he went back to ING and has been given the same
evasive/vaque explanation: "Your case is under investigation.
We'll call you when it's finished." (or words to that effect.)
3. (D)has extensive business relations in both Costa Rica and
Venezuela. He desparately needs a 1passport to travel
freely.
4. As far as I know, (O)has been a loyal/daring agent who has
always been ready to cooperate (and still does). If we
possibly can -consistent with current policy- offer a hand to
this man, at this time, we will be creating a great amount
of goodwill with(2) God know we need to hang on to as many
good and old friends as we can.
5. IF -for some reason-D's case with ING is murky, and he is
ineligible to be an ANCIT, then we should know that, too.
6. Before beating this dead horse any further, let me sum up.
If its a bureaucratic snafu by INS, lets help (0) if, on
the other hand, INS has legitimate cise against (0) lets
find out the detalls for the sake of our security.
7. (C)
I promised pass the word to our people up Branch
hopefully have some word on the status of his case soon.

16 OCTOBER THAT AWWOLF! LEFT THE CONSULATE ALONE AND WENT TO HIS
APARTMENT. ON THE BASIS OF THIS ALERT, POSITIONED ANCHALIKIS
NEAR GARAGE WHERE AMWOLF/ PARKS HIS CAR.

2. AT 1656 HOURS 16 OCTOBER WHEN AMWOLF/! LEFT THE GARAGE,
AMCHALY/5 WAS ABLE TO STOP HIM HALF A BLOCK FROM HIS APARTMENT
AND CARRIED ON A SIX MINUTE CONVERSATION. INITIALLY AMWOLF/!
WAS COLD, VISUALLY UPSET BUT LATER BECAME JOVIAL. AT FIRST
INSISTED THAT AMCHALK/5 COME TO THE CONSULATE OR CALL HIM TO
SET UP MEETING. HOWEVER, ANCHALK/5 INSISTED THEY TALK THEN
AND AMWOLF/! AGREED. AFTER AMCHALK/S MADE THE PITCH, AUWOLF/!
REACTED BY SAYING "THESE JOHNIES' HAVE EVERYTHING AND NOW THEY
REALLY STEPPED ON ME". AWWOLF/1 ENDED THE CONVERSATION BY
AGAIN AKSING AMCHALK/5 TO COME TO CONSULATE OR CALL HIM SO THEY
COULD HAVE ANOTHER TALK. AWWOLF/1 RETURNED TO THE CAR WHERE HIS
WIFE WAS WAITING AND STARTED THE MOTOR AND THEN STOPPED AGAIN AND
GOT OUT. HE THEN HAD AMCHALK/5 COME OVER AND INTRODUCED HIS

ANNOLF/1 WOULD CHANGE HIS POSITION NOW. AMCHALK/5 BELIEVES WE SHOULD
WAIT A FEW DAYS BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANOTHER CONTACT EITHER BY ANOTHER
MEETING OR TELEPHONE CALL, STATION AGREES WE SHOULD WAIT A FEW
DAYS BUT THAT A TELEPHONE CALL SHOULD PRECEDE ANY MEETING. IF THE
TELEPHONE CALL PRODUCES A CONTINUED NEGATIVE REACTION, WOULD NOT PROCEED
WITH SECOND MEETING UNLESS HQS DESIRES CONTRARY. BELIEVE WE
WILL GET SOME REACTION FROM QUTINID IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT AFTER THE ENCOUNTER, ANWOLF/1 WENT TO THE

HIM AT THE CONSULATE.

7 October 1972

1. I met AMCHALK-5 at the airport and spent three hours
with him between flights. I passed him the note from C/COG
for delivery to his contact in Madrid station. This note
confirmed what I told AMCHALK-5 orally concerning the amount
of money that could be offered AMWOLF-1 for his defection er
recruitment.

2. I briefed AMCHALK-5 on the contact arrangements and
operational plan proposed by Madrid. AMCHALK-5 is still
confident that he will have success in his contact with AMWOLF-1.

MEMORANDUM FORE Record

SUBJECT : Meeting with AMCHALK-5
TIME AND PLACE: Miami, 3 and 4 OCTOBER

1. I met AMCHALK-5 at 1430 hours at the Rusty Pelican
Restuarant. I told him we would like to have him travel
immediatoly in order to arrive in Madrid by 9 October. AMCHALK-5
said he could make it with no problem. He wasn't sure his wife
would be able to go on such short notice, but that didn't matter.
I briefed him on the contact arrangements sent from Madrid and
described WIBALDA to him. I told him WIBALDA'S name is "ROBERTO."
AMCHALK-5 said he would make the 0930 hours contact on 10 October,
but of course if something goes wrong that he will go to all
the alternate meetings. He will be wearing a white sports
jacket, white shirt, blus tie, blue slacks and black shoes.

2. I told AMCHALK-5 that WIBALDA would have the letter
for AMGHOST-1 for hia to take to the meeting, and I told him
again not to use the letter unless his recruitmont pitch had
no results. If he does pass the letter, I suggested that he
flex it to prove to AMWOLF-1 that it does not contain a bomb.

3. I told AMCHALK-5 that it looked good for a surprige
contact with AMWOLF-1 on 10 October and because ho would bo
going to lunch with a woman not connected with his offico.
AMCHALK-5 was pleased to hear this sa because he feels he must
make the contact unannounced for it to be effective. He said
that if the October 10 contact was missed, there would probably
be another luncheon the following week. AMCHALK-5 is willing
to stay in Madrid as long as n–µ—Å–µ–≤–≤–∞–≥—É.
4. AMCHALK-5 was sorry to hear that I won't be going to
Madrid because he wants to be sure that he is given as much
flexibility as possible, and not forced to handle the approach
in a manner that he would not be comfortable with. I told him

WE AMCHALK.S
14-00000

-2-
that IBALDA understood the situation, and that I was sure it
would all go well. AMCHALK-5 assured me that he has no inten-
tion of letting himself get into a physically dangerous situation
during the contact.

5. If the contact is made next wook, AMCHALK-5 will be
back before the PACHANKIS is. I said we would want to debrief
hia in Miami and that either I would see him or PACHANKIS would.
I said that if PACHANKIS talks to him, he can tell PACILANKIS the
completo details of the operation unless I phoned him otherwise.
5. We arranged to meet again at 1900 hours when AMCHALK-5
wogld have his itinerary, and I could pass him the money he needed.
AMCHALK-5 doesn't want to be paid for this job, but I insisted
again that we would pay all his expenses, and I told him to save
his totel bill and other receipts. We met at 1900 hours at the
Vizcaya bar and then drove around in AMCHALK-5's car. I passed
hia 81,500 for which he signed a receipt. AMCHALK-5 had gotten
reservations and will leave Miami for New York on 7 October and
- thes fly to Lisbon that same night. He will spend 8 and 9 October
in Lisbon where he will rent a car and drive to Madrid, arriving
in the evening on 9. October. He has reservations in the Agumar
Hotel for 9 October, and he will make the first contact at 0930
hours on 10 October.
7. I wished ANCHALK-5 good luck. He is much more optomistic
about his chances with AMWOLF-1 than I am, but it is good to work
with a man with enthusiaam. Just in case AMCHALK-5 should be
successful, we should be prepared to support him. I suggest that
ve cabie Madrid telling them what and how much we are willing to
offer should AMWOLF-1 be interested in defecting. I told AMCHALK-5
that he could promise usylum, but I did not tell him how much money
he could offer as an inducement for either recruitment in place or
defection.

7. I wished ANCHALK-5 good luck. He is much more optomistic
about his chances with AMWOLF-1 than I am, but it is good to work
with a man with enthusiasm. Just in case AMCHALK-5 should be
successful, we should be prepared to support him. I suggest that
we cable Madrid telling them what and how much we are willing to
offer should AMWOLF-1 be interested in defecting. I told AMCHALK-5
that he could promise asylum, but I did not tell him how much money
he could offer as an inducement for either recruitment in place or
defection.
