16 December 1966

The Honorable J. Walter Yeagley
Assistant Attorney General
Internal Security Division
Deparment of Justice
Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Walt:

After you informed me on 29 November 1966 of the
Possible indictment by the U. S. Attorney in Florida of Rolando
Masferrer and others concerned in the plan to launch an expedition
from Florida against President Duvalier of Haiti, I asked for a
report on our knowledge of, or involvement in, this activity.

As you know, we have installations in the Miami area
which utilize a variety of sensitive covers. The Chief of Station
coordinates his activities closely with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and
the Bureaus of Customs of the Department of the Treasury and
disseminates to those offices in the area pertinent intelligence
Information

Our Station was well informed on the plans of Masferrer -
and his cohorts and disseminated this information in the normal
manner. Part of this reporting included information that Masferrer
and some of his associates repeatedly asserted that their plotting
had been approved by the U. S. Government. On some occasions
they stated this approval came from this Agency, and other
times they intimated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
approved their actions. These claims were apparently used to
persuade various persons, primarily Cuban exiles, some of whom
formerly had contact with the Agency, to join the plot. It appears
logical to assume that Masterrer will continue to claim that he
had received what he interpreted to be U. S. Government approval
of the scheme to overthrow President Duvalier, and if he has

F/b 201-42669

SECRET

nothing more positive he can take the approach that he considered
the U. S. Government tacitly approved his plot since it obviously
knew about it and did not take any action against him.

For the record, it can be flatly stated that neither by
statement nor by implication has the Central Intelligence Agency
indicated to anyone that it approved or was supporting the plot.
On the contrary, those who queried people they knew were con-
nected with our Agency concerning possible participation in the
plot were told that it had no U. S. Government backing whatsoever.
Some of the plotters attempted to contact this Agency through
various intermediaries, and the intermediaries were told that the
Agency wished to have nothing to do with the undertaking and that
any information concerning violations of U. S. laws should be
passed to law enforcement agencies, particularly the Bureau of
Customs and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Technically,
therefore, the Agency has stayed clear of the plotters, and we
would be in a position to state that we had no connections with the
plot and had given it so encouragement or backing of any sort.

As a practical matter, however, if prosecution were
pursued, Masferrer, and perhaps other defendants, would probably
claim that they had CIA backing and some might even believe it to
be true. This might well lead one or more defendants to seek
a subpoena duces tecum for an Agency witness and the Agency
documentation on the subject. As noted above, the witness can
testify to the fact that the Agency had in no way participated or
encouraged the activity. If it proved impossible to quash the
requirement for production of documents, however, we would be
faced with a situation where we would almost certainly have to
claim the documents were privileged on the grounds of security.
Aside from the sensitivity of the reports and their possible
compromise of sources, we would have the problem of identification
of our personnel under cover and of protecting the sensitive cover
arrangements.

The same is true to a lesser extent of action against
Masferrer in connection with violations of his parole. In view
of the flagrant and numerous violations which were actually
known to and reported by Government agencies without any
punitive action resulting, it would appear that he could make a
plausible claim that the Government had at least winked at, if

not condoned, his activities. It would seem preferable to have
him nominally put under a more stringent parole, perhaps with
an accompanying requirement of bond. In the event he violated
this new status, prompt action could be taken on those circumstances
alone.

Sincerely,

/s/

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION between

Andrew St. George -- CBS photographer.
William G. Bowdler,

SUBJECT: Invasion of Haiti

Andrew St. George called me from Miami.

He said that he and the CBS film erew, headed by a Mr. McMullin
(phonetic), were back ia Miami to cover the departure this weekend
of the expedition which Rolando Masferrer was organising to invade
Haiti. St. George claimed that Masferrer had recruited 300 men and
arranged for the use of one B-89, two C-468 and a large boat. He
said that all the preparations were so much in the open that it was
evident that Masferrer and his Haitian colleagues had received the
"green light". Recent events in Haiti, plus Masferrer's activities,
were attracting a lot of newamen to Miami.

I teld St. George that he was mistaken about the "green light". We
will not telerate vielation of our neutrality laws. Our enforcement
agencies, whose dety it is to enforce these lave, will cot permit
what he described taking pizce. I wanted him and those with whom
he was dealing to be clear on this point. He said he would inform
Mr. MeMallin.

SOURCE: US national with wide travel experience in Latin America. Es speaks some
Spanish, and has many social and business contacts in the Lominican Republic.
(This report vas developed by a Navy representative assigned to the office of
preparation.)

1. On 28 Oct 66 I spoke with Rolando Masferrer Rojas, a Ciben exile, and he told
me that he has organized a military force of approximately 250 men to invade
Faiti. The invasion force consists of Caban and Eaitian exiles residing in
the U3, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic. The invasion will probably
bo Lunched from the Dominican Republic sometime between 5 and 13 November
and the target is Port-su-Prince. The invasion force vill strike in the
early hours of the morning selected. It is vell arned, and will have air
cover; the presidential palace vill be bombed.

2. Masferrer stated that Eigene L. Maximilien, Haitian Consil in Miami, Florid,
is aware of the invasion, but he has no knowledge of the invasion date.
Maxinilion is presently in Haiti informing President Dralier that the invasion
ean bo prevented by paying off $200,000 to Kasferrer.allion will return
to the ts on 3 November and he has agreed with Vasferrer that if Duvalier
agrees to the pay-off, Maximilien vill receive $50,000 and Masferrer $150,000„ÄÇ

3 Masferrer told me that the invasion vill take place in any event and the
$150,000, if received, would be used to further support the invasion.

4. Masferrer stated that he met within the past 10 days with several dissident
Haitian army officers and be had received their export. De Haitian army
officers told Vasferrer that they would revolt as soon as informed that the
Invasion had commenced. They do not know that the target vill be Port-au-
Princes they believe that it will be in the cap Esities area.

5. Masferrer stated that he was confident that the invasion will succeed, and if
successfuli, Father Joan Baptiste Ceorzes vould be appointes provisional
president. Kasferrer stated that Colonel Rene Leon, Estiasile, vill Moulle

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE APPRAISAL OF CONTENTS TENTATIVE.
SOURCE Former Latin American diplomat who maintains relations with officials o
Latin American countries. Source is a trained reporter and his informa-
tion has been reliable in the past. He obtained this information from
Aurea Esther Poggio.

1. On 21 September 1967 in Miami, Florida, Aurea Esther Poggio,
Cuban emigre who is a secretary to Rolando Masferrer Rojas.
said that plans had been made to assassinate persona linked
with revolutionary movements in Miami opposing President
Francois Duvalier of Haiti. Poggio said that the first such
attempt was against Julio Aton Constanzo Palau on 17 September
1967.

2. Poggio said that Masferrer's group was investigating the
matter in an effort to find out who was carrying out the
assascination plans for Duvelier.

1. Field Comment: Constanzo, Cuban emigre, was among those indicted
vith Masferrer, former Cuban senator, and Father Jean Baptiste Georges,
Haitian emigre, by a federal grand jury in Miant in February 1967
charges of conspiring to launch an invasion of Haiti from the Florida
Keys. No coverage of an attempt to kill Constanzo has been noted in
the local press.

2. Headquarters Comment: According to IDCS-314/08723-67, about mid-
1907 Duvalier instructed Andre Elie, Faitian Consul in Bew York, to
keep close surveillance on Haitian exiles and to report all plans
for invasions of Haiti.

MEMORANDUUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Liaison Meeting with FBI New York Agent Frank O'Brien

1. At 1500 hours on 13 September, Ken Millian and I
net with FBI Cuban specialist Frank O'Brien at a cafe/coffee
shop at 72ad St. and 3rd Ave., two blocks away from the Bu-
reau's New York headquarters. I had arranged the meeting by
telephone from Washington and advised C'Brien that I wanted
to review and coordinate a number of items with him. I also
informed him that I would be accompanied by Millian, a col-
league interested in the Cuban UN Mission.

2. The meeting opened at an easy pace with an uninhib-
ited review of happenings of mutual interest. O'Brien noted
that in his view the Cubans at the Mission had been relative
ly inactive and had not recently been involved in subversive
activities of any magnitude. He reviewed FBI coverage of as
yet not fully explained purchasing activity by Mission per-
sonnel which included procurement from various New York area
military surplus cutlets of ponchos, leggings, and other
similar equipment. He implied that in the process of cover-
ing the activities, the Bureau had acquired a substantial
amount of surplus equipment itself but he didn't provide de-
tails and we didn't pursue the matter.

3. He noted that blanket Bureau coverage of the activ-
ities of Rolando Masferrer was continuing and that he occa-
sionally talked with Masferrer by telephone or in person.
He indicated that the Bureau was intimately aware of efforts
on the part of Masferrer and other Cubans both in New York
and Florida to procure arms in the U.S. and position them ir
the Dominican Republic. He reported that an attempt to nove
a shipment of such arms from the Florida Keys to the D.R..
currently was underway and that the U.S. Customs Service was
alerted to move in at the appropriate time to confiscate the
material. (Although acknowledging Masferrer's gangster back-
ground, O'Brien compigmented him on his intelligence and ef-
ficiency and indicated that Masferrer was one of the ablest
Cuban refugees he had net.)

4. O'Brien also surfaced his current contact with for-
ner Rebel Army Captain Raiwindo F. Antonio de la Torre v

the U.S. who are attempting to re-establish the 26th of July
Movement here in the United States minus the Communist im-
plications contributed by Fidel. O'Brien apparently is im-
pressed with De la Torre's sincerity and ability and belicves
that De la Torre should be of interest to us. De la Torre
has until recently stayed away from exile activities and ac-
cording to O'Brien is pushing the revitalized 26th of July
idea by personal contact rather than make any splash. Ac-
cording to O'Brien De la Torre is now operating a successful
painting business and at one time held a good position with
Union Carbide International. In conversations with O'Brien
O 
De la Torre has been critical of CI... When queried O'Brien
indicated that den fortes only real gripes the
Pigs. (C/O note: We should look into De la Torre to see if
he could be used in any revitalized effort abroad to estab-
lish lines of access to nen-Communist 26th of Julyers still
in Cuba Carlos Franqui etc.) We indicated that we would
evaluate information available to us and discuss De la Torre
with him again in the future.

5. Note: O'Brien has been working the Cuban target in
New York for over ten years and is impressively conversant
with the subject. It is, therefore, sometimes difficult to
stay with him when he covers various complicated subjects
with abbreviated statements, e. g., during subject meeting,
he alluded to one Miguel Morales, the former husband of Nellie
Barletta, daughter of Batista's ambassador to Argentina
Anleto Barletta. He apparently feels there may be mileage
in Morales. We will, therefore, review Morales, Barletta,
et al, and resurface the subject with him when time permits.

6. The two principal action items on my agenda were
the coordination of my planned luncheon meeting with photo-
journalist Lee J. Lockwood (201-78771), and discussion of
NEKNIFE, who allegedly was interviewed by the Bureau in New
York several years ago. O'Brien advised me that he had re-
viewed their Lockwood file and talked with the Bureau agent
responsible for the Lockwood "case". He stated that he had
not uncovered any derogatory information on Lockwood and saw
no reason to prevent my meeting with him. I told him I would
advise him of my meeting arrangements with Lockwood when they
were firm and that I would brief him after the meeting was
over. (It is of interest to note that during my briefing
of O'Brien on the morning of the 16th, the day following my
luncheon with Lockwood, O'Brien noted that some of his supe-
riors in Washington thought Lockwood was an opposition (sic)
"spy". When I asked if there was anything to support this

theory, O'Brien said absolutely not, it was pure speculation.)

7. O'Brien checked the Bureau's New York indices on
NEKNIFE Lut without success. If he was in fact interviewed
by the FBI in New York there apparently was no record of
it. I told him that NEKNIFE was expected in New York City
in late September to visit his daughter and
