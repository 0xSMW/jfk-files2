2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
11 November 1975
Bob,

There are, in my mind, two distinct problems which have to be
addressed by the Task Force. These are (a) final proofing of the
sterile copy of the file, and (b) ensuring that the machine run accurate-
ly reflects what actions were taken with regard to full and partial
declassification.

In the case of the final proofing only one person review the entire
ssnitzed file to ensure consistancy in the released product, eliminate
duplicate materials and pick up any errors which may have slipped past,
1.e. crypts etc. This should not take long, perhaps a day and should
probably done by a person with a fresht view, i.e. not having done the declassific
The second problem may take more time. It would be the reviewing of
each of the documents indicating what declassification , if any was done
and accurately reflecting the action on the machine run. The would be a
two man job. An attendent problem would be indicating on the machine run
whenever duplicates tearing other numbers appear in the file. (In some
cases we have found two, three or more copies of the same document, bearing
a different number, larded throughout the files.) A tertiary problem is the
marking on the machine run cases of drafts, research notes etc. My re-
commendation for this phase could be for a person from the Task Force,
familiar with files and the entire excercise work jointly with a person
from C/CI/EKO's office.
