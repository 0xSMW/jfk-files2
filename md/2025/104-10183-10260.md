[Briefing in Guatemala of Chief of State Peralta]

1. The briefing was held in a small [various]
government conference room on the afternoon of Friday,
9 October 1964, lasting about 2 1/2 hours, Chief of State 08.06,
Colonel Peralta, Minister of Government Colonel Serrano] 08.06,
[08.06 and Intelligence Chief Colonel Porres attended for the Guate-
malans. Raul Loeb and Andy Rogers of our station were
present.
[03.03.16-2] [27.03]

2. At the request of the [Raul Loeb] I
prefaced the operational briefing with a brief description
of how the C.I.A. Intelligence community operates, on the
role of CIA, of the need for compartmentation and security,
and specifically of how the foregoing considerations make
it imperative for the Guatemalans to adopt security pre-
cautions which will ensure that the information we provide
and the [Bytact operations] we undertake are compartmented [24
within the Guatemalan government] (and, in fact, discussed
by the Guatemalan government exclusively with our re-
presentatives in the field).

3. Following the introductory remarks outlined
above, I briefed the group on the DCI structure, the DCI
operational techniques and specifically on GI [Finances] and
operations in Guatemala.[The President] lent close attention
throughout the briefing and examined the exhibits closely,
including the intelligence requirements for Guatemala [24
and the Salvadoran "Case Zapote" file]

4. After the foregoing exposition, I explained
[24] our aims in exploiting the information with regard to the
[recruit[ment] aspect, the CA play, and the [trous-24]
versions in this connection. I asked for close cooperation [24
and coordination of activities promising that we shall
do our [utmost] and [making] reference to our [travel lists 24
and watch list.]

5. [with] reference to the [APOT case] because
of the developments at [plans] in [El Salvador] [I explained]
briefly the status of the case and the possibility
[24 of his being transferred to Guatemala]. (This was in line
with the discussion [El Salvador] [which included our Chief] [27
of station, the President, and the President’s intelligence 08.06
advisor, Colonel DAN Iassed] that the Guatemalan
government have no action unless requested by President [24
IVERA or Colonel and said that, if [DALTON 24]
is transferred] one of our people probably would talk to
[24 DALTON in Guatemala]

6. The Chief of State Peralta made a rather
impassioned speech in which he covered the following points:

a. His own long experience in the CIA, in Cuba
and in Central America;

b. His early warnings about Castro—which
were disregarded;

c. The extent to which Guatemala has lived up
to its obligations in the A[to] of which it has
[24 cooperated in] [efforts] [against Castro and to
which it has looked toward U.S. leadership];

d. The failure of the U.S. to take aggressive
action against Cuba and the need for taking a
hard line, including the use of force in support of
military activity by the free Cubans and the other
American countries;

e. His appreciation that the Soviets will not be
willing to risk a nuclear war over Cuba;

f. Condemnation of Mexico for her dealings with
Cuba, for failure to abide by her obligations in
the OAS, and for permitting the Castroites to
operate out of Mexico against other American
countries;

g. The need for action against Mexico;

h. The effectiveness of his own actions against
guerrillas in Guatemala and his determination
to meet violence with violence;

i. Recognition of the importance of the information
covered in the briefing, and of its exploitation;

j. Reference to the case of the [Mexican Courier]
working for Cuban intelligence and now detained
in Guatemala (the ART case)

k. Acceptance of security restrictions and his
decision to hold the information to those present.

7. In replying to the remarks of Colonel Peralta
I said that we appreciate the cooperation of Guatemala in the [24
OAJ] and that we shall be most interested in the exploitation
of the possibilities in the present case. I added that the matter
of using force against Cuba is a policy matter on which I was
not competent to comment but that the decisions made by the
United States Government are based on careful study of
detailed information including information on Soviet intentions
and capabilities.

d. At the conclusion of the meeting, [Peralta]
asked for a copy of the [Lal requirements] (which he already
had gone over closely) and took the copy with him to study
further.
