   1. INDICATE HOW, WHEN, WHERE, HOW AND BY WHOM SUBJECT WAS FIRST CONTACTED OR DEVELOPED.
      In response to Headquarters requests, London Station officer George H. Katzenbach contacted Subject in London
      in mid-January 1965 for the purpose of debriefing him on his experiences in the pro-ChiCom milieu in Africa and
      western Europe up to the time of his departure from the staff of Revolution in Spring 1964. This was followed up by
      in-depth debriefing sessions carried out by Katzenbach in a PBSWING conference room on 17,18,19 and 23 February.
      On the basis of these talks it was decided to recruit Subject for a test assignment in Algiers during the summer of 1965
      during which time he would attempt to build long-term access and cover for reporting on activities and
      personalities in the Afro-Asian community. KUDESK/ICG staffer Joseph S. Tiffany was dispatched to London TDY
      1-7 June for this purpose. After recruitment and agreement to LCFLUTTER examination, Subject was introduced to
      his Paris-based Case Officer, Rufus F. RODIGAST, on 3 June.

   2. INDICATE WHETHER SUBJECT COULD BE TURNED OVER QUICKLY AND IN A SECURE MANNER TO ANY RESPONSIBLE CASE OFFICER FOR
      HANDLING. IF SO, INDICATE TO WHOM.
      Yes/ To any Case Officer introduced to him by RODIGAST, TIFFANY or KATZENBACH.

   3. LIST OTHER CASE OFFICERS WHO HAVE HANDLED SUBJECT OR WHOM HE KNOWS OR HAS KNOWN. GIVE NAMES BY WHICH THEY HAVE
      BEEN KNOWN.

                                                   MOTIVATION AND CONTROL
SECTION 1H

   1. ESTIMATE SUBJECT'S MOTIVATION. (Be detailed i preferable cite evidence. Do not use stock comments such as anti-
      communism.")
      Subject's lack of funds and a job are of primary importance. His need for
      cash (evidenced to some extent by his attempt to peddle articles to China Quarterly,
      Encounter and Atlantic Monthly in the fall of '64) was critical. But of even
      greater significance is his desire to effect his long-range rehabilitation in order
      not to be stuck in the morass of the impecunious and "morally fraudulant" extreme left

   2. INDICATE WHAT CONTROL, IF ANY, EXISTS OVER THE SUBJECT. (If no control, or if there is a lack of real control
      explain.)
      for the rest of his life. Also important in Subject's motivation is the sense of
      adventure connected with "The Game", which is enhanced by his desire to deceive
      (to put one over on) those persons, such as Verges, who exploited and deceived him.
      Subj. evinces deep contempt for these professional revolutionaries and what he
      refers to, with feeling, as their "moral fraud".
      Control exists quite strongly in the area of Subject's material welfare and
      need for rehabilitation.

                                                    COVER
SECTION II

   1. COVER USED BY SUBJECT AND CASE OFFICER IN THEIR MEETINGS.
      Subj. explained to his wife that "Wilson" (Katzenbach), who telephoned his home
      was an American publisher's representative. Subj. and Rodigast will use a journalist/
      literary agent cover in the unlikely event their clandestine meetings are compromised.

   2. COVER USED BY SUBJECT IN OBTAINING HIS INFORMATION AND IN CONTACTING HIS INFORMANTS.
      Freelance journalist, author.                                            sympathetic list

   3. INDICATE SERVICE FOR WHICH SUBJECT THINKS HE (Will work) (Is working).
      KUBARK

SECTION IV

   1. EXPLAIN SUBJECT'S KNOWN PAST OR PRESENT CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. INDICATE THE EXTENT
      SUCH CONNECTION IS KNOWN OVERTLY.
      Subj. applied for association with KUBARK in 1950 and again in 1960; his enemies
      have tried to discredit him by calling him a KUBARK agent, but there is good evidence
      that this rumor campaign has not hurt him among his friends, even his friends on the
      extreme left of the political spectrum. No known I. S. connection.

   2. LIST OTHER INDIVIDUALS (Agents, relatives, friends) WHO KNOW OF SUBJECT'S PRESENT INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.
      None.

                                                               SECRET
                                                     OPERATIONAL USE CONTACT
   1. IF SUBJECT HAS BEEN USED OR CONTACTED BEFORE, INDICATE ACTIVITY IN WHICH HE HAS ENGAGED AND THE TYPE OF INFOR-
      MATION HE HAS FURNISHED.
      In December 1963 Subj. was interviewed by a consulate officer in Paris for
      information on Lee Harvey Oswald, who reportedly had some contact with the Fair
      Play for Cuba Committee. Subj. was completely co-operative and the interviewer
      suggested follow-up, but the contact was dropped.

      Subj. elicits information from his broad circle of friends and acquaintances
      in the Afro-Asian/liberation movement areas.

   3. INDICATE WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD SUBJECT AS TO THE DISPOSITION OF INFORMATION HE FURNISHES.
      Nothing

   4. DETAIL SUBJECT'S PROPOSED PR-CI TYPE USE OR DUTIES.
      Subject will operate under free lance journalist cover to develop contacts
      in the target milieu of Afro-Asian "Anti-imperialist" activity and solicit informa-
      tion from them on their activity, plans and views. It is possible that such
      contacts may lead to a possibility of employment or association with some organ-
      ization in this field, but whether or not he will be instructed to accept will
      depend on the specific nature of the job and similar factors which cannot be
      anticipated now.

   5. DETAIL SUBJECT'S PROPOSED PP-PM TYPE USE OR DUTIES.
      No PM duties or use is anticipated. No systematic CA exploitation is
      anticipated given the risk of compromise. Selective CA exploitation within his cover
      situation - i.e. as a provacateur or means to surface anti-Soviet material
      from a "National Liberation" standpoint - will be continually possible.

   5. EVALUATE SUBJECT'S CHARACTER. RELIABILITY AND SECURITY, CITING EVIDENCE WHERE POSSIBLE.
      Subject is a rather cynical intellectual. He has a keen sense of what is in his
      best interest, however, and there is every reason to believe that he considere a
      reliable and secure performance for KUBARK to be in his best interest. He showed
      a good sense of security in communications during his recruitment period. LCFLUTTER
      examination 13 June 1965 revealed no deception by Subject.

      CE/OPERATIONAL SECURITY VIEWPOINT.
      While working for AFP in Paris (1958) Subject forged the signature of a personal
      enemy, Ollie Harrington, to a letter to the editor calculated to get Harrington in

      and vary as to time and place. As signal is provided for (removal of glasses, which
      both wear) should either wish to prevent the meeting. A simple carbon-pad type, low
