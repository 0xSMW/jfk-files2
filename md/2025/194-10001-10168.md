SYNOPSIS

Permission to interview WERBELL granted by IRS. Review of air and surface
shipment records, Eglin AFB, FL, failed to disclose any information pertinent
to this investigation. WERBELL interviewed by IRS. During interview WERBELL
advised that firearms shipped to him by SUBJECT in April 1969 were obtained

AF museum purposes. WERBELL asserted seized firearms were sent by him to
Vietnam after receiving State Department approval and were to be returned to
SIONICS by Air Force. No authorization for this action was obtained by WERBELL.
WERBELL advised that firearms which were not sent by him to Vietnam, and which
were seized at Eglin AFB, were sent to SUBJECT for use in Air Force museums and

This report relates to an investigation conducted at the request of
Chief Special Investigator, Jacksonville, Florida. The Office of
Special Investigations, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in conjunction
with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division, Pensacola, Florida, is
currently conducting an investigation, regarding the alleged illegal
Importation of certain Title II firearms by Lt. Col. Paul A. Marriott.

On September 16, 1969, Special Investigator in Charge Arbie R. Odom, Jr.
and I interviewed Mitchell L. VerBall III, at his residence in Powder
Springs, Georgia. In answer to questions asked by Florida, we obtained
the following informations (1) The shipment of firearms shipped by
Lt. Col. Marriott on or about April 11, 1969, to Sionics, Atlanta, Georgia,
contained 11 Title II firearms. These weapons were obtained by Mr.
Gerbell in Vietnam and registered during the amnesty period. Sionice
did not apply for or receive authorization to import these firearms.

(2) The additional boxes of Title II firearms received at Eglin Air
Force Basa during June 1969, were sent at the request of Mr. WerBell
by ARPA, and Col. Patterson authorized the shipments after Mr. WerBell
told him they were for Air Force museum purposes. Mr. Werbell was
shown a list of firearms contained in the two boxea currently being
held by the OSI at Eglin Air Force Base and asked to identify any
belonging to sionics. Ha stated all the sound suppressors except the
one marked HELE 4A, and the winchester Model 52, caliber .22 rifle,
serial number 69494B, were property of Sionics and were taken or sent
to Vietnam by him. He stated these were taken over on approval of the
State Department, and that the Air Force had agreed to send them to
Vietnam and return them to Sionics; however, he has no written author-
ization. He stated the remainder of the firearms were given to him by
authorized persons, and were to be given to the Air Force to put in
museums.

Before Lt. Col, Morriott left Vietnam, Mr. WerBell told him he would
sttempt to obtain captured anemy weapons which he would send to Lt. Col.
Marriott for the purpose of museum displays.

Lt. Col. Marriott told Mr. Werbell he thought the museum would be grateful
for them. Mr. Werbell stated he did not file any Formn 6 on any of the
firearms and had no knowledge of anyone else filing them.

Stonice is in the business of developing and maufacturing silencers for
sale to United States Military Unite and United States Allies. Although
there are apparent violations of Title II of The Gun Control Act of 1968,
it appeara from talking to Mr. WarDoll that on the part of Sionics, they
were unintentional. Mr. Warbell stated that prior to the passing of the
Gun Control Act of 1968, the procedure used in exporting and importing
the firearms was the acceptable mathod with the State Department.

Mr. Werbell stated on his return to the United States ha made an inventory

On 12 November 1969, KARL D. ACKERMAN (former Counselor for Administration,
United States Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand), 99 Victoria Drive, Atherton, California,
was interviewed by SA ROBERT J. NOVACK and the writer, and related substantially as
follows:

ACKERMAN had several conversations with Colonel WALTER ADAMS concerning the
practical problems of getting weapons, belonging to a MITCHELL L. WERBELL, into
Thailand from the Republic of Vietnam in order that WERBELL could put on a fire power
demonstration for the King of Thailand's birthday. At all times during these conversa-
tions, ACKERMAN assumed the weapons were WERBELL's wares, and that he had
brought them from the United States with him. With this in mind, ACKERMAN stated
that he instructed Mr. GERALD T. CARTA to annotate WERBELL's travel orders with a
Bangkok United States Embassy Funding Citation number. ACKERMAN said the citation
numbers were in a block of numbers belonging to the Embassy, and because he did not
feel he had the authority to issue WERBELL any other type of number, he issued him an
Embassy number. When ACKERMAN was asked if he knew PAUL ARNOLD MARRIOTT, he
said the name was vaguely familiar but could not recall anything further. When
ACKERMAN was asked if he knew EARLENE DOBBS, he stated that he did not, to the best
of his knowledge. ACKERMAN stated that his knowledge of WERBELL came solely from
ADAMS and other stories he heard around the Embassy of the fire power demonstration
to be given for the King. ACKERMAN stated he had no personal knowledge of WERBELL.

DETAILS
1. On 20 September 1969, Mr. GERALD T. CARTA, Staff Operations Officer, U.S.
Embassy, Saigon, Republic of Vietnam (RVN), was interviewed with the assistance of
SA RONALD A. CUNDIFF and provided the following information:

During early January 1969, a Mr. MITCHELL WERBELL, a senior officer in an
American firm (NFI), came to his office requesting assistance in shipping one or
two cartons of captured automatic weapons to Bangkok, Thailand. WERBELL stated
that he was a weapons expert and was in the RVN on invitation from the U.S. Govern-
ment to demonstrate some of his new weapon accessory inventions to the military
services of the RVN and Thailand. WERBELL indicated that he had just spent the
last 2-4 weeks in various northern sectors of the RVN, with U.S. Army Airborne and
Special Forces units. During this period WERBELL had collected various captured
enemy automatic weapons. He advised that he needed these weapons for examination,
in that he was in the process of designing a new automatic weapon that would far
surpass the capabilities of the best foreign made automatic weapon. WERBELL pro-
duced an Invitational Travel Order, issued by the USAF Air Attache, Bangkok,
Thailand. This travel order was approved by the Counselor for Administration (CFA),
U.S. Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand. This travel order authorized WERBELL to travel,
on a space available basis, from Thailand to the RVN and return. The travel order
did not reflect a funding citation, which is necessary to ship any large items
aboard a military aircraft. WERBELL stated that he had attempted to ship these
weapons aboard military aircraft stationed at Tan Son Nhut AB (TSNAB), RVN, how-
ever, because his orders did not reflect the necessary funding citation, he was
sent to the U.S. Embassy. WERBELL indicated he was going to use these captured
weapons in a fire power demonstration, to be held for the King of Thailand on his
birthday, which was on the following Saturday. WERBELL stated he was a personal
friend of the King and Queen of Thailand and numbered among his friends many high
ranking military and civilian officials of the Thai government. CARTA placed a
long distance call to the CFA, U.S. Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand. The CFA advised
that WERBELL was expected in Thailand by the King for a weapon demonstration, to
be held on the King's birthday. The CFA was informed that WERBELL wanted to ship
one or two heavy cartons to Thailand. The CFA then gave CARTA the Bangkok U.S.
Embassy funding citation, with instructions to have same added to WERBELL's
travel orders. He then asked the CFA: "Do you know what he wants to ship?" and
the CFA replied: "Yes, it's okay". After this conversation the weapons were
packed, along with some items of official equipment, as identified by WERBELL.
Transportation Control and Movement Documents were executed and signed by CARTA.
The U.S. Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand, funding citation was reflected on these
documents. At no time did CARTA examine the contents of the boxes. CARTA iden-
tified the Transportation Control and Movement Documents reflected as attachments
1 and 3, ROI, DO7, 2 Sep 69, as the ones executed and signed by him. CARTA could
provide no explanation as to why one of the Transportation Control and Movement
Documents (Atch 1) reflected the contents as antique arms. CARTA stated that he
knew of no other shipments of firearms that had been processed by WERBELL. He
concluded that he does not know SUBJECT, nor has he ever processed any shipments
under SUBJECT's name or for SIONICS, INC.
