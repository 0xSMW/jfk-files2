In regard to Task #7 of General Lansdale's review this memo notes, "Moreover, the development
of a resisitence movement will not remain controllable, so that operational time tables
produced during the next four weeks can serve only as guides for a proposed sequence of
actions." (00107)

The memorandum notes that six men to form the initial nucleus for work for inside Cuba
have been assessed in depth. Fifteen locations have been selected as suitable centers for
resistence. It was also noted that in support of State's efforts, CIA has conducted pro-
paganda operations including a number of mass demonstrations in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

OCCURRENCE: In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam with the CIA participants
being McCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that McNamarra pointed out that
Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone commented
that he believed that we should move cautiusly, that we should talk seriously to Diem
_and_that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic
view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach
be made to Nhu to seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we
had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid. (as proposed in a paper prepared
by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President
asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent
to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some
real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the
PresidesOURCEould be well informed of any steps taken in this contexSTAFFSuch as thes
instance involving CIA payment to Col Tung last week.

In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam on October 29, 1963 with MCCONE, HELMS, AND COLBY
in attendance. The following record by HELMS and COLBY shows that: it was suggested
that in the Ambassador's absence, HARKINS, TRUEHART, and DAVID SMITH act as a
committee to direct a coup operation. MCCONE countered with the view that SMITH should
not be involved in such a-policy-making function, although he would be in a position-to-
provide technical advise to HARKINS and TRUEHART as well as carry out their instructions
in the operations field. The President stated that if the forces in Saigon were not
clearly in favor of the coup we should discourage its launching. The Attorney General
felt the U.S. was risking too much based on flimsy ev idence. The DCI stated his view
that even a successful coup would create a period of interregmum, confusion which might
only be solved by a second or third coup.

Lansdale briefed the group on numbers of agents in Cuba. Air resupply
proposal submitted by CIA "should be deferred pending broader review of the entire
situation." Taylor noted if urgent need for air supply proposal could be made to the
Special Group Augmented at any time. "Mr. McCone emphasized that no high-level penetra-
tions of the Cuban government have yet been attained." "The Attorney General inquired
about the status of popular support for Castro, and also the possibility of a revolt
against him." Lansdale_replied, "There is no rallying point for active opposition."
The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities
by Castro in the hemisphere. A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of

suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme
sensitivity of any such operation and the disasterous results that would flow
from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to
_the_U.S. He went on to say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish
this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the paper. He men-

he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear

informed (AMLASH) that the U.S. is prepared to render all necessary assistance to
any anti-Communist Cuban group which succeeds in neutralizing the present Cuban
leadership." (89) Despite the fact that SANCHEZ reported that "nothing of an operational
nature was discussed at the FITZGERALD meeting (90), FITZGERALD recalled that
AMLASH-1 "spoke repeatedly of the need for an assassination weapon. In particular,
he wanted a high-powered rifle with telescopic sights or some other weapon that could
be used to kill Castro from a distance." (90) FITZGERALD said that he told AMLASH
"that the U.S. Government would have no part of an attempt on CASTRO's life. (90)
However, the SANCHEZ memorandum reported "After the meeting (AMLASH stated that he

In a memorandum by SANCHEZ on November 13, 1963, it was reported that "FITZGERALD
informed (AMLASH) that the U.S. is prepared to render all necessary assistance to
any anti-Communist Cuban group which succeeds in neutralizing the present Cuban
leadership." (89) Despite the fact that SANCHEZ reported that "nothing of an operational
nature was discussed at the FITZGERALD meeting (90), FITZGERALD recalled that
-AMLASH-1
_In_particular,
he wanted a high-powered rifle with telescopic sights or some other weapon that could
be used to kill Castro from a distance." (90) FITZGERALD said that he told AMLASH
"that the U.S. Government would have no part of an attempt on CASTRO's life. (90)
However, the SANCHEZ memorandum reported "After the meeting AMLASH stated that he
was satisfied with the policy discussion but now d nd to know what technical support
we could provide him."(90)
