Note that the above volumes are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. I have asked Barbara if there is a volume 4 and 5. She said that Project Files are maintained in 4 parts: production, Developmental Plans, support and Operations. She said she thought I had the whole file but would check with the Mexican desk to make sure. Barbara returned call and said that the person on the Mexico desk was on a 2 weeks vacation so she could not find an answer for my question.

1.  HMMA 22452 also cites other cables that reported ameri- cans in contact with the Cuban embassy. Mexi 6591 reported on chill from Herb Provost from Las Vegas claiming to be a student working with the Cubemb. The dispatch says: "Further dissemi- nation was left to Head quarters." Mexi 6615 reported contact between NYT writer Herbert Matthews and the Cubemb. The dispatch says: "No Investigative action was taken by the Mexico Station."

2.  HMMA-22678, 1/2/64 is the first monthly opera- tional report for LIENVOY after the assassination Under "exploitation" ... "the dispatch says: "The most significant information provided by LIENVOY was record of contact by lee

Oswald with the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. Oswald's contact had been cabled to Heart- quarters on 8 October 1963 for investigation by ODENVY (MEXI-645-3)." Under the "Liaison" heading the dispatch says

To the LIENVOY operation since it was necessary for Curtis to request his assistance in investiga- ting a highly sensitive lead in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy. This has been reported in detail to Headquarters via other channels."

1.  HMMA 22788- 1/24/64 says: "There is attached one copy of the Cuban Embassy traffic

covering the period from 16 January through 23 Janu- ary 1964. HMMA-22959 transmits the take for 2/11 to 2/21. HMMA 23019, 3/4/64 transmits the take for 2/22 to 3/2. My examina- tion of the dispatch traffic between 10/16 and 11/26 shows that the Cubemb take was transmitted to HQ routinely on a weekly or bi-weekly basis also during that period. There are some "transcripts" in this file. They are yellow carbons in Spanish. They cover the period 1/16/64 to 1/23/64. These are the only ones in the file.
