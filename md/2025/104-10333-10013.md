Subject: PC Support for Assassination Record Review Board (ARRB) Reviewers

Attached is Scott Nann's note on INFOSEC procedures.
It appears that the ARRB reviewers will be able to take lap- tops in and out of the building as long as security requirement for handling classified diskettes and Classified PCs are met. HRG will have to maintain the proper logs and forms.

I propose we implement Situation #3 (board reviewers can carry their own SECRET Laptops daily in & out of the building). Establishing procedures for a LOG and the Form 4261 should not be a problem. We will need 2 or 3 HRG staffers with media badges to fill out the form 4261 or to escort the Board reviewers out of the building.

Dear Mr. Pereira:

As we previously discussed, please initiate the necessary action to grant the appropriate SCI clearances for Carolyn Carpenter, SSN 538-46-7574. Ms. Carpenter's file was reviewed by the Department of Justice Personnel Security Office. The DoJ recommended granting a Top Secret clearance and postponing a decision on SCI pending a CIA review for special exception to DCI Directive 114, paragraph 5C, due to foreign in-laws.

As you may recall from our conversation, Ms. Carpenter is a former CIA employee. I would like to request that the investigation for her SCI clearance be given careful consideration. It is extremely important to the Review Board that our clearances meet the highest standards of the agencies with which we have dealings.

The Review Board has informed Ms. Carpenter that her employment is contingent upon receiving the appropriate clearances. Therefore, I respectfully request that her case be given top priority. If you need further information, please contact either me or Tracy Shycoff, our Deputy Security Officer. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Jim Oliver C/HRG

FROM: Martha Lutz
Chief/Research PRD

SUBJECT: Secrecy Agreements with Commission Members

1. At your request, PRD searched its files to find information on how secrecy agreements have been handled vis a vis members of commissions dealing with intelligence-related matters. There have been three instances of PRD interface with such commissions. The first was in 1994 when the Joint Security Commission requested a PRB review on its report on Counterintelligence and Security Policies, Procedures and Practices in the CIA in the aftermath of the Ames affair. There is no mention of Commission membership or secrecy agreements in our files, and, in fact, the Commission report was finally and properly re-reviewed by a different entity for official declassification.

2. PRB was also asked to review the final report of the Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Commission (Brown Commission) in 1996. Again there is no record of secrecy agreements with Board members in our files.

3. Finally and most recently, the Rumsfeld Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States was established in 1998, and its members signed secrecy agreements. John Hedley, PRB Chair, spoke with the members in March, explained pre-publication requirements and emphasized the Board's and staff's willingness to provide guidance and prompt responses to Board members. Since that time, four of the nine Commission members have submitted a total of 12 manuscripts for review.

Ramona, ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS

The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of whether secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the Board"), and offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted diligent searches, both internally and externally (FBI, White House), to locate any secrecy agreements that members of the Board may have signed. Those searches have been unsuccessful - to date, no secrecy agreements have been found. We now intend to search selected Agency records systems to see if there exists any reference to, or indication of, particular secrecy agreements that the Board members may have signed. We also will attempt to locate any secrecy agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any secrecy agreements the members may have signed. At this point, however, the likelihood that these actions will bear fruit are not good.

Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect to future writings of the Board members, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board would knowingly reveal classified information). Before considering the options set forth below, it is worth noting that whatever approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the Board's unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we submitted to the Board. With that in mind, our options are:

1. Do and say nothing, and hope that the Board members will voluntarily submit any future writings for prepublication review.

2. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation not to reveal classified information in any way, without specifically mentioning prepublication review, and again hope that they will voluntarily submit any future writings for prepublication review.

3. Provide a specific security exit briefing for the Board which expressly mentions that they have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to publish (related to their work as Board members) as part of their obligation to protect classified information,

ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY

ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY
and hope the Board members do not ask for the source of this obligation (since we cannot provide them with any signed secrecy agreements). In essence we bluff the Board. (**A variation of this approach would be to have the Board execute an SCI debriefing statement, which includes a prepublication clause, although it is limited to SCI material**)

4. Have the Board members sign secrecy agreements on the way out. This option would be difficult to implement as there would be no incentive for a Board member to sign it (there exist no sanctions for not signing), and it would be legally unenforceable (since the agreement would provide a benefit to the Agency, but not to the Board members, and therefore would not contain the legal consideration necessary to establish a binding contract). We would have to hope that the question of enforceability issue is not raised - essentially, amounting to another bluff.

5. We can rely on language in the Snepp case, as interpreted by the Department of Justice in the mid-1980's, that appears to permit the Agency to write a regulation that requires prepublication review of the possibly classified writings of non-CIA personnel given access to CIA information, to allow the DCI to protect intelligence sources and methods. The regulation would be signed by the DCI, and then the Board would be briefed on their responsibilities and obligations under the regulation.

ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS
Ramona,

The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of whether secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the Board"), and offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted diligent searches, both internally and externally (FBI, White House), to locate any secrecy agreements that members of the Board may have signed. Those searches have been unsuccessful - to date, no secrecy agreements have been found. We are also searching selected Agency records systems to see if there exists any reference to, or indication of, particular secrecy agreements that the Board members may have signed. In addition, we are attempting to locate any secrecy agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any secrecy agreements the members may have signed. At this point, however, the likelihood that these actions will bear fruit are not good. Moreover, this effort has been complicated by the fact that, at the outset, the FBI was given responsibility for the security clearance process relating to the Board.

Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect to future writings of the Board members and staffers, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board or its staff would knowingly reveal classified information). The last meeting of the Board will take place on 23 September, and the Board will be out of business as of 1 October. If we wish to address the Board on this issue as a group, the 23 September meeting will be our last opportunity to do so. Otherwise we will have to deal with each Board member and staffer individually, if at all. Before considering the options set forth below, it is worth noting that whatever approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the Board's unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we submitted to the Board. With that in mind, our options are:

1. Do and say nothing, and hope that Board members and staffers will voluntarily submit any future writings for prepublication review.

2. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation not to reveal classified information in any way, without specifically mentioning prepublication review, and again hope that they will voluntarily submit any future writings for prepublication review. Board members and staffers sign nothing.

3. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation not to reveal classified information in any way, and also makes available our prepublication review services to assist them in this regard, if requested, with respect to any future writings (related to their work as Board members or staffers). Board members and staffers sign nothing. The success of this option depends upon the willingness of Board members and staffers to voluntarily submit any future writings for prepublication review.

4. Provide a specific security exit briefing for the Board which expressly mentions that they have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to publish (related to their work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified information, and hope the Board does not ask for the source of this obligation (since we cannot provide them with any signed secrecy agreements). In essence, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.

CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL
5. In lieu of a security exit briefing, send each Board member and staffer a letter which expressly mentions that they have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to publish (related to their work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified information. This approach would make it more inconvenient for the Board to probe for the source of this obligation (which we would be unable to produce since we have not found any signed secrecy agreements). Again, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.

6. Ask Board members and staffers to sign secrecy agreements on their way out. This option could be difficult to implement as there would be no incentive for a Board member to sign it (there exist no sanctions for not signing), although Board staffers have indicated they would support this approach. Generally speaking, a secrecy agreement signed on the eve of separation from government service would be legally unenforceable (since the agreement would provide a benefit to the Agency, but not to Board members or staffers, and therefore would not contain the legal consideration necessary to establish a binding contract). However, in this case, if the agreement was modified to indicate that it merely reduced to writing understandings which had been previously agreed to by the Board, we would have a strong argument the agreement was legally binding. Of course, this option would alert the Board to the fact that we do not have any secrecy agreements previously signed by the Board. Even if the Board agrees to sign new secrecy agreements before they disband, nothing would preclude them from disputing the enforceability of the agreements at a later date.

6. We can rely on language in the Snepp case, as interpreted by the Department of Justice in the mid-1980's, that appears to permit the DCI to write a regulation to protect intelligence sources and methods by requiring prepublication review of the possibly classified writings of non-CIA personnel who have served in positions of special trust and have been given access to CIA information. The regulation would be signed by the DCI, and promulgated immediately. Then the Board would be briefed on their responsibilities and obligations under the regulation. Of course, nothing would preclude the Board from disputing the validity of such a regulation at a later date.

None of the above options guarantee success. However, I have discussed these options with Dawn Eilenberger, and we believe that Option #_ is the best approach to take. OIM concurs. Please let me know how we should proceed, since our last chance to deal with the Board as a group will be at their 23 September meeting.
