IRS [JFK Law 11(a)]

It has already been reported to the Bureau that
ROSSELLI deposited this $25,000.00 check to his account at
the Fidelity Bank, Beverly Hills, California, on 7/11/63.

IRS [JFK Law 11(a)]

On 9/20/63, Los Angeles Police Department advised
that recently one of their officers called the last known
telephone number they had for ROSSELLI. This number was
OL 4-7164. ROSSELLI has not had this number since March,
1961. The officer asked for ROSSELLI and the woman who
answered said ROSSELLI was not there but would be in later.
The woman then told the officer that Mr. NESSER was in and
could probably help the caller (LAPD Officer). The officer
declined to talk to NESSER. The Los Angeles Police Department
ascertained that telephone number OL 4-7164 is currently listed
to Home Savings and Loan Association. IRS, Los Angeles, who
had also received this information from the Los Angeles Police
Department ascertained that OL 4-7164 is answered by Lauria's Tele-
phone Answering Service for GORDON NESSER, an employee of Home
Savings and Loan. IRS also found that during the past two
months, ROSSELLI has received several calls in c/ NESSER
at telephone number OL 4-7164. IRS has already made arrange-
ments for interview of NESSER regarding his relationship
with ROSSELLI, and specifically as to whether or not ROSSELLI
has invested money in some real estate venture.
