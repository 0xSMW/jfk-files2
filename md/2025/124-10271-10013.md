RE: SUPERSEDED SECTIONS OF THE
MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS

Reference is made to the SSC memorandur, with
attached appendices, dated April 30, 1975, requesting
certain documents and other information from the FBI.

Part one of referenced memorandum requested this
Bureau to make available for review various superseded
sections of the Manual of Instructions (MOI). Appendix A
attached to referenced memorandum set forth the sections
requested for review. Mr. Mark Gitenstein, SSC Staff
Member, has advised FBI Special Agent Paul V. Daly that
revisions to the MOI should cover the period January 1,
1960, to the present.

These superseded sections are now ready for
review at FBI Headquarters by appropriately cleared
personnel of the SSC Staff. It should be noted that for the
period January 1, 1960, to the present, there were no
revisions of MOI Sections 95 and 97.

Re: Superseded Sections of the
Manual of Instructions

NOTE:

Pursuant to a prior SSC request, we furnished them
current MOI Sections 36, 84, 86, 87, 88, 95, 97 and 122.
Due to the sensitive nature of Sections 105, 107 and 130,
these were made available for review only at FBIHQ.

Listed below are the Intelligence Division
representatives and the MOI sections reviewed for this
project:

Section 36-Espionage James W. Johnson CI-1
Section 84-Registration Act Dennis R. Dickson CI-3
Section 86-Sabotage Louis J. Brune IS-2
Section 87-Investigations of William N. Preusse IS-2
Subversive Organizations and Thomas J. McNiff
Individuals
Section 88-Sedition George J. Lex IS-2
Section 105-Internal Security- James W. Johnson CI-1

Dennis R. Dickson CI-3
Section 107-Internal Security Edward P. Grigalus IS-2
Informants and Confidential James W. Johnson CI-1

intelligence Assets Dennis R. Dickson CI-3
Section 122-Extremist Matters Robert D. Shea IS-1
and Civil Unrest
Section 130-Extremist Informants Robert D. Shea IS-1
and Sources

As previously noted, there were no MOI revisions
during the period of interest to Section 95-Treason and
Section 97-Voorhis Act.

The revisions of the MOI requested by SSC consists
of approximately 2,200 pages and is approximately 9" in
height. Due to the bulkiness of these revisions, they are
not being attached to this memorandum.

RE: REQUEST PERTAINING TO ELECTRONIC
SURVEILLANCE

Reference is made to SSC letter to the Attorney General,
with attached appendices, dated May 14, 1975, requesting certain
documents and other information from the FBI.

In Appendix D, captioned "Request Pertaining to
Electronic Surveillance," the SSC desired a response to the
following request:

Item 15. "All July and August memoranda from former
Special Agent (SA) Leo T. Clark to the Assistant Special Agent
in Charge (ASAC) or the Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the
Newark, New Jersey, Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), captioned 'Protection of the President - White House
Inquiry.'"

In regard to the aforementioned, a thorough review of
the files of the Newark Office of the FBI did not reveal the
existence of a file bearing the caption, "Protection of the
President - White House Inquiry." However, this review did
disclose the existence of a file bearing the caption, "Protection
of the President. A thorough review of this file failed to
uncover any memoranda emanating from former SA Leo T. Clark at
any time.

In addition, a thorough review of other files main-
tained at the Newark Office believed relevant to the subject
matter of this inquiry, did not reveal any memoranda, letters
or other type communications prepared by former SA Clark.

A thorough review of pertinent FBIHQ files discloses
no nemoranda emanating from former SA Clark regarding this
ratter.

NOTE:

Telephonic instructions were issued to the Newark

New Jersey, National Convention, August 22-28, 1964," personnel
files of former Assistant to the Director DeLoach, Assistant

tain any memoranda prepared by SA Clark regarding the Democratic

SUBJECT: SUGGESTED NAME CHANGE
XCRIME RECORDS DIVISION. DATE: 10-16-72
:

By memorandum dated 10-4-72, attached, it was
indicated that
has suggested
a name change for the Crime Records Division to Office
of Public Information or some other more meaningful designation.

It was pointed out that
suggestion
was in line with informal discussions you (Mr. Bishop)
have had with members of your staff concerning a possible
name change for the Division.

In this connection, Mr. Gray has noted that
he "can think of many reasons for changing the name.
What have been the nature of the reasons for change discussed?"

With the formation of the Computer Systems Division
and the resultant reassignment of the personnel and
the work of the Uniform Crime Reporting Section, including
the National Crime Information Center/Computerized Criminal
Histories file from Crime Records to Computer Systems,
the title "Crime Records," as
has indicated,
is no longer meaningful insofar as the work of this
Division is concerned.

"Office of Püblic Information," which was
suggested by
would inaccurately reflect
the activities and responsibilities ies of this Division
and could result in confusion with the Office of Public
Information in the Department of Justice. This, of
course, would be undesirable.

M. A. Jones to Mr. Bishop Memo
RE: SUGGESTED NAME CHANGE CRIME RECORDS DIVISION
: :

It is noted that this Division, which is presently
comprised of the Crime Research Section, and the Correspondence
and Tours Section, is primarily responsible for conducting
extensive rèsearch pertaining to crime, crime prevention,..
and other related matters in the law enforcement field.
This Division is involved in the review and préparation
of replies to correspondence regarding FBI Jurisdiction
and operations received from law enforcement, other Government
agencies, and the general public in those instances where
the Bureau has a responsibility to disseminate such information.
....
::.
.....

"The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin," which is the
official publication of the FBI, is prepared and distributed
by Crime Records, as well as numerous pamphlets for the
instruction and information of Bureau employees, the law
enforcement profession and the general public. This Division
is responsible for supervision of tours of Bureau facilities
for Government officials, law enforcement authorities,
and the general public; directs the program of distributing
informative and illustrative material on Bureau fugitives
to various media for the purpose of effecting the location
and apprehension of these criminals with the help of citizen
cooperation; and coordinates and supervises the Bureau's
interests in the utilization of radio, television, and
publication outlets to enhance the discharge of our responsi-
bilities in the law enforcement field by acquainting the
public with the FBI's operations and activities.

In addition, this Division has the custody of
a number of research and reference files which are maintained
in a current status and which are essential to the Division
in the fulfillment of its responsibilities to the Bureau.
:
Further, this Division supervises the "Ten-Most-
Wanted Fugitives" Program, as well as "The FBI" television
series, both of which involve research for their sustenance
and success.

RE: NAME CHANGE OF CRIME RECORDS DIVISION
TO CRIME RESEARCH DIVISION

In view of the transfer of the record functions
of the Crime Records Division to the Computer Systems
Division, I have approved changing the name of the Crime
Records Division to the Crime Research Division effective
immediately. The Section formerly known as the Crime

SUBJECT: REORGANIZATION - CRIME RESEARCH DIVISION.

Pursuant to your instructions, Assistant Director Bishop is
being temporarily attached to the Training Division at Quantico for special
assignment until the effective date of his retirement, 2-1-73.

Mr. Bishop will be assigned to the research and development of
a major case practical problem for use in the National Academy. This
is extremely important because our experience indicates that most of the
officers attending the Academy are unable to understand and handle the
ramifications of major cases. Mr. Bishop, with his extensive field back-
ground, plus his familiarity with news media problems, is ideally suited
to handle this assignment.

If he has time, Mr. Bishop will also analyze and develop
meaningful practieal cases which will enable new agents to meet present-
day needs.

I have arranged with Mr. Jenkins for suitable office facilities
to be used by Mr. Bishop at Quantico and have instructed Bishop to report
to Mr. Jenkins on Monday, 12-4-72.

is being diverted from his current
inspection assignment in the Office of Legal Counsel to begin an immediate
survey of the Crime Research Division to determine the feasibility of the
transfer of its functions to other divisions or to your office.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. For information.
