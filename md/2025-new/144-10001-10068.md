SIGINT DAILY SUMMARY - PART ONE

WORLD HIGHLIGHTS

1. CUBAN MILITARY UNITS PUT ON ALERT BECAUSE OF THE DEATH
OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

At 2043Z 22 Nov 63 the message "a state of alert is ordered
for all personnel. Be ready to repel aggression." (2/LR1/CUN/
R11-63). U/I military units were alerted at 2320Z on VHF voice
communications which normally link First Army Hq, Santiago with
Guantanamo City with the following message "Inform the Chief that
by orders of 117 (unit commander) here, all of them, all of the
points, were put on alert. (2LR1/CUM/R187-63).

At 2031Z, 22 November, Eastern Naval Headquarters Banes
instructed Headquarters, Southern Sector, Santiago to recall all
units. A later message from Banes to Naval Headquarters, Havana
reported all units have been recalled due to the death of President
KENNEDY. (2/QS/CUN/R665-63)ã€‚

Operator chatter indicated that the death of President
KENNEDY had been announced in Cuba. One Cuban operator remarked
"There will be some happy people here."

Other special instructions from the Cuban Government
included:

1) A circular message dated 23 November apparently sent
to all the Cuban Diplomatic Missions, in which the Cuban Foreign
Ministry instructed the missions to make no statements. (3/0/CUD/
T1380-63). 2) The Cuban Government ordered the Havana-UN link
to stay open all night an unprecedented move, and 3) The Cuban
UN ambassador was asked by Foreign Minister ROA to forward
immediately all possible data concerning President JOHNSON. He was
told to look in Who's Who and was also informed that Prensa Latina
had biographical data of this type. (3/0/CUD/T1381-63, 3/0/CUD/
T1382-63). (TOP SECRET DINAR)
