GUS ALEX
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
January 4, 1965

The Swiss Central Police Bureau, Bern, Switzerland,
furnished the following information:

The Zurich Police have established the following:

ALEX arrived at Zurich-Kloten Airport from New
York-Paris on December 20, 1964, by TWA Flight 802. DIETGARD
FUEGER checked in at the Dolder Grand Hotel in Zurich' on
December 19, 1964. She was accompanied by her mother, who
left Zurich again on December 21, 1964, by air for Munich,
Germany.

On December 22, 1964, ALEX and FUEGER left Zurich
at 10:00 a.m. by car in the direction of Pontresina. The
car in question was a "Peugeot 404" which ALEX rented from
Hertz AG. On leaving the hotel he hired a taxi stationed at
the Dolder Grand Hotel, which acted as a guide in front of
his car as far as the outskirts of Zurich.

The driver of this taxi was later interviewed by
the Zurich Police. He stated that he had driven ALEX on
various occasions, e.g. on January 27, 1964, to Kloten Air-
port. On said journey ALEX had been looking time and again.
to see whether any car was following the taxi. ALEX had
then mentioned that he knew very well he was being watched
by the police by order of his native country.

The driver also mentioned that after he had guided
ALEX and FUEGER out of town on December 22, 1964, ALEX had
asked him whether he would be available on January 5, 1965.
He, ALEX, would return on that day to Zurich.

In this respect, Zurich Police informed that ALEX
reserved two rooms at the Dolder Grand Hotel for January 5.
