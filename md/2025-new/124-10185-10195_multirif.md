Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 in a
troubled time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
law enforcement administrator in charge of the Kansas City
Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as
a Special Agent of the FBI have made him uniquely qualified
to lead the Bureau.
The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation
extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the
openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and
their willingness to consider the need for legislation to
clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.
It is important to remember from the outset that this
Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's
activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
intelligence operations. We have consistently expressed our
admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital importance
of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic
intelligence has raised many difficult questions.

Kelley took charge.
The Staff has advised the Committee that under Director
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli-
gence operations, and less on purely domestic surveillance.
The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in
developing policies and standards for intelligence. These
are welcome developments.
9
10
11
12
13
Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved.
Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the
Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress
should take into account in thinking about the future of
FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil-
14

lance should extend beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certain
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance techniques;
whether foreign related intelligence activities should be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement
functions, and what should be done to the information already
21
22
in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in
the future.
23
The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange
24
of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney

I share your high regard for the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution and laws of the United States. Throughout my
35 year career in law enforcement you will find the same insis
tence, as has been expressed by this Committee, upon programs
of law enforcement that are themselves fully consistent with
law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of legislative
oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment as Director of
the FBI and was being considered by the Senate Judiciary
Committee two and one half years ago, I told the members of
that Committee of my firm belief in Congressional oversight.
This Committee has completed the most exhaustive study
of our intelligence and security operations that has ever been
undertaken by anyone outside the FBI other than the present
Attorney General. At the outset, we pledged our fullest
cooperation and promised to be as candid and forthright as
possible in responding to your questions and complying with your
requests.

of our day-to-day intelligence operations.

credit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the
hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the FBI's
record of performance.
It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus
on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the
organization.
The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the
lion's share of public attention and critical comment constituted
an infinitesimal portion of our overall work.

to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's Counterintelligence
Programs has reported that in the five basic ones it found
3,247 Counterintelligence Programs were submitted to FBI
Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this total, 2,370,
less than three fourths, were approved.
I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247 proposals were
being devised, considered, and many were rejected, in an era
when the FBI was handling an average of 700,000 investigative
matters per year.
Nonetheless, the criticism which has been expressed
regarding the Counterintelligence Programs is most legitimate
and understandable.
The question might well be asked what I had in mind when
I stated last year that for the FBI to have done less than it
did under the circumstances then existing would have been an
abdication of its responsibilities to the American people..
17
18
19
20
What I said then, in 1974, and what I believe today, is
that the FBI employees involved in these programs did what they
felt was expected of them by the President, the Attorney General,
the Congress, and the people of the United States.

Bomb explosions rocked public and private offices and
buildings; rioters led by revolutionary extremists laid seige
to military, industrial, and educational facilities; and
killings, maimings, and other atrocities accompanied such
acts of violence from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings, men, women,
2 and children. As is the case in time of peril, whether real or
perceived, they looked to their Government, their elected and
appointed leadership, and to the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies to protect their lives, their property, and their
rights.
7
There were many calls for action from Members of Congress
8

and others, but few guidelines were furnished. The FBI and other
law enforcement agencies were besieged by demands, impatient
demands, for immediate action.

FBI employees recognized the danger; felt they had a
responsibility to respond; and in good faith initiated actions
designed to counter conspiratorial efforts of self-proclaimed
revolutionary groups, and to neutralize violent activities.
In the development and execution of these programs,
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.
Our concern over whatever abuses occurred in the Counter-
intelligence Programs, and there were some substantial ones,
should not obscure the underlying purpose of those programs.
We must recognize that situations have occurred in the
past and will arise in the future where the Government may well
be expected to depart from its traditional role, in the FBI's
case, as an investigative and intelligence-gathering
agency, and take affirmative steps which are needed to meet
an imminent threat to human life or property.

In short, if we learn a murder or bombing is to be carried
out now, can we truly meet our responsibilities by investigating
only after the crime has occurred, or should we have the
ability to prevent? I refer to those instances where there is
a strong sense of urgency because of an imminent threat to
human life.
Where there exists the potential to penetrate and disrupt,
the Congress must consider the question of whether or not such
preventive action should be available to the FBI.
These matters are currently being addressed by a task
11
force in the Justice Department, including the FBI,
12
and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and controls can

manner.
Probably the most important question here today is what
assurances I can give that the errors and abuses which arose
under the Counterintelligence Programs will not occur again?
First, let me assure the Committee that some very sub-
stantial changes have been made in key areas of the FBI's
methods of operations since I took the oath of office as
Director on July 9, 1973.
Today we place a high premium on openness, openness
both within and without the service.
I have instituted a program of open, frank discussion

in the decision-making process which insures that no future

full and critical review of its propriety.
4
Participatory management has become a fact in the FBI.
5
6

8
I have made it known throughout our Headquarters and
Field Divisions that I welcome all employees, regardless of
position or degree of experience, to contribute their thoughts
and suggestions, and to voice whatever criticisms or
9

The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine, and I take
full responsibility for them. My goal is to achieve maximum
critical analysis among our personnel without in any manner
weakening or undermining our basic command structure.
The results of this program have been most beneficial, to
me personally, to the FBI's disciplined performance, and to
the morale of our employees.
In addition, since some of the mistakes of the past
were occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities outside
the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward Levi's
guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability, in his
own words, "as a 'lightning rod' to deflect improper requests."
Within days after taking office, Attorney General Levi
instructed that I immediately report to him any requests
or practices which, in my judgment, were improper or which,
considering the context of the request, I believed presented

I am pleased to report to this Committee as I have to the

Attorney General that during my nearly two and one half years as
Director under two Presidents and three Attorneys General, no

I can assure you, too, in my administration of the FBI
I routinely bring to the attention of the Attorney General and
the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions, including
those which arise in my continuing review of our operations and
practices. These are discussed openly and candidly in order
that the Attorney General can exercise his responsibilities
over the FBI.

18
19
I am convinced that the basic structure of the FBI today
is sound. But it would be a mistake to think that integrity
can be assured only through institutional means..

Integrity is a human quality. It depends upon the
character of the person who occupies the office of the
Director and every member of the FBI under him.

As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment have been
made. But no one who is looking for the cause of our
failures should confine his search solely to the FBI, or even
to the Executive Branch.
The Congress itself has long possessed the mechanism for
FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been exercised.
An initial step was taken in the Senate in 1973 when the
Committee on the Judiciary established a Subcommittee on FBI
Oversight. Hearings had been commenced, and we were fully
committed to maximum participation with the members of that
Subcommittee.

the past.

This means too that Congress must assume a continuing role
not in the initial decision-making process but in the review of
our performance.

I would caution against a too-ready reliance upon the
courts to do our tough thinking for us. Some proposals that
have been advanced during these hearings would extend the role
of the courts into the early stages of the investigative

process and, thereby, would take over what historically have
been Executive Branch decisions.

I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked, would
seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary and cast
23
22 them in a role not contemplated by the authors of our
Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a substitute for Con-
24
gressional oversight or Executive decision.

Senators, first and foremost, I am a police officer, a
career police officer. In my police experience, the must
frustrating of all problems that I have discovered facing
law enforcement in this country, Federal, state, and local, is
when demands are made of them to perform their traditional
role as protector of life and property without clear and
understandable legal bases to do so.

I recognize that the formulation of such a legislative
charter will be a most precise and demanding task.
13
It must be sufficiently flexible that it does not stifle
14

the FBI's effectiveness in combating the growing incidence
of crime and violence across the United States. That charter
must clearly address the demonstrated problems of the past;
17

yet, it must amply recognize the fact that times change and
so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive
`challenges.

The fact that the Department of Justice has commenced
the formulation of operational guidelines governing our
intelligence activities does not in any manner diminish the need
for legislation. The responsibility for conferring juris-
diction resides with the Congress.
In this regard, I am troubled by some proposals which

As a practical matter, the line between intelligence
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult
to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation may
well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But there
are some fundamental differences between these investigations
that should be recognized, differences in scope, in objective
and in the time of initiation. In the usual criminal case, a
crime has occurred and it remains only for the Government to
identify the perpetrator and to collect sufficient evidence
for prosecution.
Since the investigation normally follows
the elements of the crime, the scope of the inquiry is
limited and fairly well defined.
By contrast, intelligence work involves the gathering of
information, not necessarily evidence. The purpose may well be

not to prosecute, but to thwart crime or to insure that the
Government has enough information to meet any future crisis
or emergency. The inquiry is necessarily broad because it
must tell us not only the nature of the threat, but also whether
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the
23
24
25
means by which the threat will be carried out. The ability
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent on
our anticipation of those criminal acts. Anticipation,

Certainly, reasonable people can differ on these issues.
Given the opportunity, I am confident that the continuing need
for intelligence work can be documented to the full satisfaction
of the Congress. We recognize that what is at stake here is not
the interests of the FBI, but rather the interests of every
citizen of this country. We recognize also that the resolution
of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful
deliberation by the Congress. To this end, I pledge the
complete cooperation of the Bureau with this Committee or
12
its successors in this important task.
