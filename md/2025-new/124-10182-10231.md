Reference is made to the December 18, 1975, letter
of the SSC as modified at a conference on December 30, 1975,
between Messrs. W. O. Cregar and P. V. Daly of this Bureau
and Committee Staff Members Michael Epstein and Mark Gitenstein.

This memorandum effects delivery of material in
response to Items 1, 1(a), 1(b), and 1(e). The matters
referred to are four FBI investigations about which the SSC
was previously furnished materials relating to FBI preventive
actions.

Concerning Item 1, which requested reports or letter-
head memoranda (LHis) disseminated outside the Bureau by FBI
Headquarters (FBIHQ), for the six-month period preceding the
act of violence prevented, the following is noted. In regard
to the incidents involving the proposed assassination of a
narcotics agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the planned racial
violence in Cleveland, Ohio, there were no reports or LHMs
submitted by either the Minneapolis Field Office or Cleveland
Field Office during the six-month period preceding the incident.

U. S. Senate Select Committee

Concerning Item 1(a), which requested predications
for each investigation, it should be noted that in the incident
involving the proposed assassination of a narcotics agent, there
was no predication submitted by the Minneapolis Field Office.
This was due to the fact that there was no FBI jurisdiction
concerning this matter and consequently no investigation by the
FBI.

Concerning Item 1(b), which requested the first
investigative report or LH disseminated by FBIHQ outside the
FBI in each case, and a list of recipients of that report or
LIM, the following should be noted. Regarding the incident
involving the proposed assassination of a narcotics agent, no
report or LHLi was submitted by the Minneapolis Field Office as
there was no FBI investigation. On the administrative pages
accompanying reports or Lil's involving the other incidents,
thore are notations which identify those agencies which received
copies of these documents.

Item 1(e), requested annual reports or LI's from the
Office of Origin to FBINQ for the last five years during which
each case was an open (pending) investigation. Regarding the
incidents involving the Hanafi Muslim sect in Washington, D. C.,
the proposed assassination of a narcotics agent in Minneapolis,
kiinnesota, and the planned racial violence in Cleveland, Chio,
no annual reports or Lihis were submitted by either the Washington,
Cleveland, or Minneapolis Field Office.

Reference is made to the oral request of Special

1975, for information concerning six individuals whose names
were placed on the National Security Agency (NSA) Watch List
because of FBI investigative interest in them.

In response to that request, enclosed are the
original and one copy each of six memoranda relating to the
following individuals:

2. Stokely Carmichael

The memoranda include information as to the reasons
why these individuals were investigated by the FBI, included
on the Watch List and the use made of the product received
from NSA concerning them, if any. Regarding those individuals
on whom there is no record of receipt of information of a
positive nature from NSA, it should be noted that it was our
practice to destroy upon receipt any Watch List "product" which
did not appear to be of significance in our investigations_and
to retain neither copies nor record of receipt.

NOTE:

On 10/20/75, Mr. Jack Marsh of the White House
contacted Jack Fuller, supra, concerning this matter and
Mr. Fuller requested that we select six individuals who had
been included on the Watch List and furnish the requested
information for possible use at an Executive Session of the
SSC. On 10/20/75, Mr. Dave Lohman, NSA, advised Supervisor
J. P. Thomas, INTD, that NSA was aware that we were going
to receive this request; that there was no need, from NSA's
standpoint, for classification of response merely because
it stated that certain persons were on the Watch List. He
stated NSA intended to tell the SSC the number of requests
it had received from other agencies, including FBI, to put
names on the Watch List but that NSA had told Jack Marsh, supra,
that specific names would have to be furnished by the agencies
interested in the particular subjects.

Kathie Boudin is being sought by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation as a fugitive in connection with
her unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, for mob action
and for violation of Federal Anti-Riot Laws, the National
Firearms Act, and Bombing Matters. She is being sought
as a Weatherman fugitive. Weatherman is a violence-prone
organization of Marxist ideology which operates an
operates
underground movement for the purpose of committing acts
of terrorism. Weatherman members have been known to
travel abroad and were suspected of maintaining a system
of international communications.

Boudin's nane was furnished the National
Security Agency by communication dated April 16, 1973,
along with names of other individuals affiliated with
the Weatherman organization. During 1973, a source who
had furnished reliable information in the past advised
he observed in Havana, Cuba, an individual whom he
believed to be identical with Boudin. A second source
who had furnished reliable information in the past
advised Leonard Boudin, Kathie's father, had made a
statement that Kathie Boudin was in Cuba.

There was no indication any information of a
positive nature was received from the National Security
Agency concerning Boudin.

STOKELY CARMICHAEL

Assoc. Dir.
Dep. AD Adm.
Stokely Carmichael is a well-known and publicly
identified black extremist. Carmichael, during the approximate
period 1967 to present, has openly called for revolution
by blacks and the destruction of capitalism in America through
violent action.

Carmichael was among individuals of investigative
interest who were placed on the National Security Agency's (NSA)
Watchlist because of his extremist activities and contacts
which include both domestic and foreign personalities of similar
persuasion.

In addition to maintaining his residence in Guinea
and frequent trips to the United States, Carmichael has also
traveled to North Vietnam, Cuba and People's Republic of China.
Information furnished the Federal Bureau of Investigation by
IISA included data concerning his foreign travel, his visits to
the United States, travel of associates to visit him in Guinea
and invitations to attend various international conferences.

This information received from NSA, in some instances,
was furnished appropriate FBI Field Offices to assist this
Bureau's investigation in following the travel and extremist
activities of Cermichael.

1- Mr. K. A. Mendenhall

Handelsman was sought by the FBI as a fugitive in
connection with Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution for
Mob Action, Aggravated Battery, and Aiding Escape. He had
also been charged with Conspiracy for Possession of
Unregistered Firearms and Interstate Transportation of
Explosives and Incendiary Devices. Handelsman was sought
as a Weatherman fugitive. Weatherman is violence-prone
organization of Marsist ideology which operates an under-
ground movement for the purpose of committing acts of
terrorism. Weatherman members have been known to travel
abroad and they were suspected of maintaining a system
of international communication.

Handelsman's name was furnished to the National
Security Agency (NSA) by communication dated April 16, 1973,
along with the identities of other Weatherman fugitives.
Handelsman had studied in South America during the mid-1960s
and it was believed at the time of furnishing his name to
the NSA he was outside the United States, possibly in a
Latin American country.

There is no indication any information was
received from the NSA of a positive nature concerning
Handelsman.
