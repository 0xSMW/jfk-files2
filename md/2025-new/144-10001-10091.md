FR Cairo: -- 27 Nov 63
TO Rome: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: --

Signed: MAGISTRATI.

It was not difficult to foresee that the dramatic murder
of the American President with all of (3G) new complications

of Hebrew-Polish origin has now caused a notable part of the
Cairo press to move in the (5G) that Zionism (13G/M) to this
whole tragedy. Naturally, there are no explanations of motives
and circumstances but this subject (B val also) is, in the eyes
of some of the Arab extremists, useful in muddying the waters
and once again directing accusations against Hebrew organizations.

A report follows.
