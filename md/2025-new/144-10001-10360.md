UN DISARMAMENT TALKS REPORTED

FR New York: Polish Mission to the UN 22 Nov 63 1900
TO Warsaw: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Routine
Msg. Nr. 484

For RAPACKI

In accordance with your instructions in Nr. 12173Âª LACHS continued talks
on disarmament with the Americans along these lines:

A. Inspection points plus threats is one of the possibilities.

B. Formal unilateral steps, actually simultaneous reductions by
both sides.

Talks with a representative of the Department of State: In recent talks
with GROMIKO, the USA proposed the destruction of a certain number of bombers
by both sides without inspection. GROMYKO did not turn down the proposal.
They are ready to expand the idea to include rocket launchers and other types
of weapons also without inspection, in order to comply with the reservations
of the USSR. He considers a formal agreement on future reductions or a freeze
too difficult to attain next year because of elections. A confidential agree-
ment is possible.

Information of KENNEDY's assassination was received during the discussion.
The reaction: Eliminates the possibility of any steps for elections and
freezes the situation.
