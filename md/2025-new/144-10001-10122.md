WARREN COMMISSION FINDINGS SUMMARIZED FOR BRAZILIAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY

FR Washington: JURACY MAGALHOES- 25 Sep 64
TO Rio de Janeiro: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 1614

As announced at the beginning of this week, the report
of the commission headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, which investigated the assassination of President
KENNEDY, was handed to President JOHNSON yesterday. The
report is very lengthy, but is to be printed for wide distribu-
tion, according to the desire of President JOHNSON that there
be no doubts in regard to the circumstances and motivation
of that crime.

Sunday afternoon, the day after tomorrow, the report
will be made public, which will make possible its transcription
in the morning press on Monday.
:

The ceremony of handing the report to President JOHNSON
was attended by all members of the commission appointed by
him, which became known as the WARREN Commission and which
was made up of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Senator
RICHARD RUSSELL and JOHN SHERMAN COOPER, Congressman HALE
BOGGS and GERALD FORD and our Mr. JOHN J. MOCLOY and Mr. ALLEN
DULLES.

It appears that the conclusion of the WARREN Commission
is that LEE OSWALD was the sole author of the crime and that
his motive was strictly personal. In regard to the assassination
of OSWALD, the Commission appears to have accepted the thesis
that JACK RUBY also acted on strictly personal motivation both
evidently having suffered from mental unbalance or instability.
