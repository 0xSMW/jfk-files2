PEDRO LUIS OSCAR DIAZ LANZ
IS CUBA

Rerep SA William H. Wightman 2/26/60.

Bureau Source 6 in communication_classified "Top [5]
Secret" advised that on 3/18/60 the Cuban Embassy in Mexico [5]
reported to its headquarters that Diaz Lanz was possibly in
Mexico trying to buy an airplane. According to Bureau Source CSJ
6, he was trying to contact the pilot, Cesar Gomez, who was
dusting crops. Under no circumstances should Bureau Source 6 [5]
data be set forth in reports.

Miami will advise by return airtel whether Pedro Diaz
Lanz is in Mexico and, if not, whether the Diaz Lanz mentioned
above could be either his brother, Marcos Diaz Lanz, or any
other member of his family.

In view of the likelihood that a Federal grand jury
will be convened in the immediate future in the Rundquist-Shergalis
matter and the possibility that the subject may be called as
a witness, Bureau desires that a current report be submitted.
This report must reach the Bureau by April 11, 1960.
