BULGARIAN REACTION TO ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

FR Sofia: FERREYRA 26 Nov 63
TO Buenos Aires: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 50

The [Bulgarian] Government presented official condolences
to the United States Government on the assassination of
President KENNEDY. The Minister of Foreign Affairs visited the
United States Minister for the same purpose.

The people received the news with surprise and regret.
The local television station repeated via Moscow the burial
services in the United States. The press of this country
eulogized the personality of the late President as a supporter
of peace, attributing his death to an ultrarightist group.

All the diplomatic missions flew their flags at half-
mast -- the Soviets with black crape -- with the exception of
Communist China. Religious services held in Sofia were
attended by representatives of all the diplomatic missions.
