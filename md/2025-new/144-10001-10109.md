SEMINAR ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND PEACE MEETS IN INDIA

Msg Nr: 1518-21
[4-part message complete]

 The conference on foreign affairs and peace organized by
the "Committee of Indian Parliamentarians for Peace" (my
telegram Nr. 1418((A))) was opened on Saturday by the Prime
Minister, who dwelt on the beneficent effects of the lessening
of tension between East and West and on the necessity that the
efforts in this direction should not be interrupted as a
consequence of President KENNEDY's assassination. He repeated
the Indian Government's attachment to the policy of nonalignment
despite Chinese aggression, which it had been obliged to stop
by force, and pointed out that it is not enough to denounce war,
but that it is advisable to find means to prevent it.

 The only foreign representatives -- despite the efforts
of DIWAN CHAMAN LALL, who incidentally had asked me to obtain
messages from President DE GAULLE, Mr. POMPIDOU, and Your
Excellency and to whom I replied that it is not our tradition
to send them to meetings of this type -- are Soviet, Yugoslav,
Ceylonese and British. Moreover, Madame NIKOLAEVA, member of
the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, brought congratulations only
from the nongovernmental organization. Yugoslavia delegated
Mr. VILFAN, former ambassador to New Delhi. Mr. GREENWOOD,
Chairman of the Labor Party, read a communication from
Mr. HAROLD WILSON but made it clear that he was participating

 in the seminar as a private individual.

 As for the Indians, the (B val leading voices) are on the
whole either crypto-communist or left-wing members of Parliament.
We might name Mrs. ARUNA ASAF ALI among the former and
Mr. MALAVIYA, former Minister of Fuel, and (B val Mr. KRISHNA
MENON) among the latter. The last-named, in his speech, made
a point of stating that in spite of the provocations of China
and Pakistan, India was maintaining her peaceful policy. He
observed that there can be disarmament or peace only to the
extent that there is a rapprochement between the USSR and the
United States: "The more these two powers work together, the
better it will be for the world."
