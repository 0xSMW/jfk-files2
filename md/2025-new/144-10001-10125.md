CUBAN STATEMENT ON VISA FOR OSWALD
FR Havana: RAUL ROA 25 Nov 63
TO New York: Cubarn Mission to the UN
Msg. Nr. 7469

Lam am reproducing below the note given to the press by the
Ministry:

With relation to the informat con published today in the
newspaper Excelsion in Mexico City, affirming that LEE HARVEY
OSWALD had requested a transit visa for travel to the Soviet
Union at the Cuban Consulate in. Mexico in September, the Cuban
Government requested information from the officials of our
Consulate in that city confirming that it is certain that
MI. LEE HARVEY OSWALD requested the transit visa for travel to
the Soviet Union on 27 September in the said Consulate

On being informed by the consular officials that their
office could not grant such a visa without the authorization
of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations, which likewise
would not grant it if it was not previously authorized by the
country of destination, Mr. OSWALD left the Consulate visibly
disgusted.

The said visa was never granted.

This detail in connection with the other circumstance
that surround the facts, confirm our suspicion that the
assassination of KENNEDY was a provocation against world peace,
perfectly and thoroughly planned by the most reactionary sectors
of the United States

Cuban
TOP SECRET DINAR
3/0/CUD/T1384-63

It is evident that these sectors planned beforehand to
involve Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds.

The inconceivable and inexplicable impunity with which an
individual of known penal antecedents assassinated OSWALD, the
principal accused of the assassination of President KENNEDY, in
the presence of the police themselves and in the (56) of a
prison, demonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable manner
that the powerful reactionary political forces within the
United States are making use of all their resources and influences
in order to conceal those who master-minded KENNEDY's assassination,
and the true motives for it.

World public opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds.
It is absurd that t the political authorities and the prosecuting
attorney of Dallas have declared that the case is closed when
hardly 48 hours have passed since a deed of of so great a result as
the assassination of the President of the United States..
