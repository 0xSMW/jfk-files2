We met DEVOSKIN today. He is interested in renewing nego-
tiations on Nordau Plaza.d In his opinion the construction costs,
including working capital, will amount to $1,350,000, and there-
fore the total expenses will amount to $2,350,000 to $2,400,000.
DEVOSKIN and his group are ready to invest $1,100,000. If
CHACHAMOV stays in, and his investment is estimated at $500,000;
then we still lack $750,000 to $800,000.

Please find out from [ZVI]a
a. whether the government is prepared to increase the
loan to 1,200,000 pounds, which is about $675,000, on the assump-
tion that DEVOSKIN will increase to $1,200,000.

b. whether CHACHAMOV, in the event that DEVOSKIN will
invest $1,200,000 and will pay all the creditors, will agree to
accept 30 per cent of the shares instead of 45 per cent as was
stated between him and DEVCROSKICKANS. Another difficulty with
DEVOSKIN is that he does not want to deal with creditors but wants
to take on everything unencumbered, except for the CHACHAMOV matter.
We hope that if the increase of the government loan goes through
it will influence him to increase his investment to 1,200,000 and
to get along with the creditors. CHACHAMOV should by no means be
encouraged to come here until the matter is completed. We are
meeting with DEVOSKIN on Thursday morning, 6 November.

a -- Not identified.
b Probably V. BENNAHUM of the Government Tourist Corp.
c Not identified but referred to in H-19022, 27 Oct 58. There
is a Morris Devoskin and Co. hotel brokers, in Chicago.
d Referred to in H-19022, 27 Oct 58 as Naudau Plaza.
