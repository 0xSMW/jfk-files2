in the procurement of arms and munitions by the three
Americams: (S)(4)
:

HERMINIO DIAZ, 732_N.W. 3rd Street, Miami,
Florida, sold sixty hand grenades (USMK II) to BORGES
for delivery to Americans. DIAZ received from BORGES
three hundred sixty dollars for grenades but delivered
only forty. Subsequently, BORGES asked source to go to
DIAZ and either pick up other twenty grenades or the one
hundred twenty dollars in cash which they represented,
MIAMI, FL
RAMON ESCARDA, 620 S.W. 9th Street, who served
in the U. S. Army, 1958-1959, was supposed to obtain one
hundred pounds of pentolite for delivery to BORGES for
$320-350(8)(1) SECRET

On October 23, 1965, POSADA interviewed by Bureau
Agents. FOSADA readily admitted he had been in contact
with three Americans who were seeking to purchase hand
grenades, weapons, silencers and explosives. He/had been
placed in contact with these Americans by DIEGO BORGES. He
confirmed DIAZ, ESCARDA and TAMAYO were also involved in
this transaction. POSADA said shortly after he established
contact with Americans, his CIA contact gave him several
photos in attempt to identify Americans. POSADA said he

POSADA said that six silencers which had been
manufactured at the home of TAMAYO had been given by
BORGES to ROSENTHAL. He said ESCARDA was looking for
pentolite but did not know whether material delivered
to ROSENTHAL (S4) (4) SECRET

On November 5, 1965, Bureau Agents exhibited
photo of NORMAN ROTHMAN, FBI #152 585B, to POSADA.
POSADA identified ROTHMAN as one of Americans with
ROSENTHAL. He was of the impression that ROTHMAN was
personally known to BORGES and had introduced ROSENTHAL
to BORGES. It is noted ROTHMAN was arrested April 9,
1959, and was later convicted of violation of the National
Stolen Property Act. He was sentenced to five years in
prison and ten thousand dollar fine.( fine.(4)

1967, CIA advised the Miami Division that POSADA had been
contacted by FRANK ROSENTHAL during the month of October,
1966. (1) (4)

ROSENTHAL told POSADA that all silencers he had
purchased from POSADA were pieces of junk and he felt
POSADA and BORGES were responsible for this and maybe his
friends would kill POSADA and BORGES.(54) ($)(U)

ROSENTHAL stated although he was out $5,000 from
his previous purchases, he did not want money from POSADA.
ROSENTHAL said he knew POSADA was working for CIA and he
wanted some CIA equipment. POSADA allegedly refused to do
this but POSADA made a number of fuse devices which he gave
to ROSENTHAL.

This same memo reflects ROSENTHAL contacted
POSADA in early June, 1967. ROSENTHAL stated the fuse
devices were no good which were previously furnished and
made a request for more CIA fuse devices and remote con-
trol unit for detonating explosive charges (54)
