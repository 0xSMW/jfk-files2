CHINESE DELEGATE DISRUPTS WORLD PEACE COUNCIL

FR Warsaw: AILLAUD 28 Nov 63
TO Rome: Foreign Ministry --
Msg Nr: 1357

I learned that in Today's inaugural meeting of the World
Peace Council, on which I am reporting in a dispatch of the
same date, Professor LANGE, Polish Deputy Chairman of the
Council of State, opened the work by expressing his profound
sorrow over the death of President KENNEDY and affirming that
his passing must be considered a serious loss for humanity.
The French delegate MADAULE expressed similar sentiments, pro-
posing that the entire assembly join in them. While all the
other delegations were agreeing on this proposal, a Chinese
delegate seized the microphone and, despite the Chairman's
attempts to prevent his speaking, since the intervention of the
Peking delegation had not been requested according to procedure,
stated, shouting, that KENNEDY's death should not be mourned
since he was the principal exponent of aggressive Capitalism
and that if there should be grief, it should be expressed for
all those who had died through the crime of aggression of the
capitalist system, personified especially by the United States.
A profound silence in the Assembly followed the untimely re-
marks of the Chinese delegate, after which work was resumed.
