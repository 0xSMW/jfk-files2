NOTE: SL 1495-E (former) (Bureau file 134-19686) was operated
from January, 1970, to approximately September, 1971,
primarily targeted against White Hate Groups. In 1971, he traveled
to Savannah, Georgia, at which time he reported on activities of the
National States Rights Party office and that Jerry Ray, brother of
James Earl Ray, stated he knew there was another party involved in
the killing of King and that his brother was the one who pulled the
trigger. This is the apparent HSCA interest in informant.

Referenced communications concern previous informal
requests by the HSCA that we contact SL 1495-E to determine if he
would be willing to be interviewed by the Committee. St. Louis con-
tacted informant on 1/27/78 and he agreed, but two days later submitted
a letter to St. Louis declining to be interviewed by the HSCA. Subse-
quently, the HSCA determined informant's identity through its investi-
gation and contacted him, at which time, according to the HSCA, he
agreed to interview. By letter to the Attorney General dated 1/26/78,
the HSCA has asked for all information at FBI Headquarters and in
the field concerning informant.

This matter has been coordinated with SA D. O. Coulson,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division,
and SA M. V. Hale, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal
Investigative Division.

NEW ORLEANS FILES WHICH INVOLVE THE SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS

CONSIDERED OR CARRIED OUT AGAINST KING OR THE SCLC BY THE NEW

NOTE The HSCA plans to submit a formal request regarding
this matter, but requested informant be contacted for his
initial reaction to interview. The Congressional Inquiry Unit,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit and Mr. Robert L.
Keuch, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
agree this approach is best prior to continuing discussions
to resolve legal and other issues.

The.
The apparent interest of the HSCA involves informant's
travel to Savannah, Georgia, in 1971 at which time he reported
on activities at the NSRP Office in Savannah, as set forth in
referenced communication. Informant reported that Jerry Ray,
brother of. James Earl Ray, and J. B. Stoner, National Chairman,
NSRP, were in the office when Jerry said that the FBI and he
knew there was another party involved in the killing of King
and that his brother was the one who pulled the trigger.
The.
HSCA has requested FBI information on the NSRP, Stoner,
Jerry Ray and other individuals identified as being in attendance
in the NSRP Office in Savannah during that time. One of the
