MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

CONSULATE OF ISRAEL - NEW YORK CITY, N.Y.
ENTERNAL SECURITY - IS

In several communications to you during the past
year concerning Israeli intelligence operations in the
United States, information has been forwarded regarding an
espionage ring operated by the Israeli Government in
New York City. This ring was headed by Youval Tal who
until March 29, 1954, when he departed from the United States,
was an adviser to the Israeli Delegation to the United Nations.
Also included in this ring were Yigal Giland and Efrain
Pillersdorf, employees of the Consulate of Israel, New York
City.

The Department of State has informed this Bureau
that on April 14, 1954, Assistant Secretary of State Henry A.
Byroade conferred with Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban and
expressed to him the disquiet of our Government at the
activities of Tal, Gilaad, and Pillersdorf. Mr. Byroade
noted the fact that Tal had recently left the United States
and told the Israeli Ambassador that our Government con-
sidered it desirable that Gilaad and Pillersdorf also be
withdrawn.

It is anticipated that the departure of these
three men from the United States probably will not
result in the discontinuance of Israeli intelligence
activities in the New York area. Since the activities
have centered about the Israeli Consulate there in the
past it is possible that they will continue to be con-
ducted from that establishment. Accordingly, it is
recommended that you authorize technical coverage at

The Workers World Party (WP) consists of former
Socialist Workers Party (SWP) members who split from the SNP
in February, 1959. The WP favors a stricter interpretation
of Marxism-Leninism based upon the writings of Leon Trotsky
than does the SilP.

This Bureau is currently investigating the WWP and
the SWP. The latter organization has been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.

Milton Neidenberg was appointed organizer of the
Buffalo Branch of the WWP on May 26, 1960, and it is anticipated
that he will conduct WP business in his home. Current informants
reporting on-the-WifP are only able to report on weekly meetings.
Technical coverage would materially aid the Buffalo Office in
its investigation of Neidenberg and the WWP, and would provide
immediate intelligence information regarding the organizational
efforts of the Will both locally and nationally. It is noted
that most of the WWP membership is located in Buffalo, New York.
