The tragic death of President KENNEDY has aroused deep emotion
here. President NYERERE last night convened the Council of Ministers,
whose decisions he did not, however, make known; he said he was too
overwhelmed to make a statement. Today has been declared a day of
national mourning. (B val Government offices), banks, and schools
are closed.
