# John Garrett Underhill Jr.: A Comprehensive Biography

## Introduction

John Garrett “Gary” Underhill Jr. (1915–1964) was an American military intelligence officer, journalist, and linguist whose life intersected with the shadowy worlds of espionage and Cold War intrigue. A Harvard-educated World War II veteran who served as a Captain in Army Intelligence, Underhill later worked as a journalist and consultant on military affairs, developing close connections with figures in the U.S. intelligence community. He earned a reputation as a self-taught expert in small arms and limited warfare, moving comfortably among high-ranking military officers and CIA officials during the early Cold War years. Underhill’s sudden death in 1964 – officially ruled a suicide – and his purported claims that a rogue clique within the CIA was behind President John F. Kennedy’s assassination have made him a subject of enduring controversy. Over the decades, declassified documents and investigative reports have shed light on Underhill’s career and allegations, allowing a more complete picture of his life. This biography provides an exhaustive, scholarly account of John Garrett Underhill Jr.’s life, from his distinguished family heritage and wartime service to his postwar intelligence contacts, personal writings, and the conspiracy theories that surround his death. All known aspects of Underhill’s life are examined in detail, drawing on credible primary sources – including CIA and FBI records released under the Freedom of Information Act – as well as third-party accounts from journalists and historians. Speculative claims, such as those in the 1967 Ramparts article that first publicized Underhill’s JFK assassination allegations, are addressed critically in the context of the evidence. Through a careful analysis of archival documents and witness statements, this biography aims to clarify Underhill’s contributions and controversies, and to assess his posthumous reputation in light of modern scholarship.

## Early Life, Family Background, and Ancestry

John Garrett Underhill Jr. was born on August 7, 1915 in Brooklyn, New York. He came from a family with deep American roots and notable lineage. His father, Dr. John Garrett Underhill Sr. (1876–1946), was a prominent author and translator of Spanish literature who earned a Ph.D. from Columbia University and served as a theater producer. Underhill Sr. was active in cultural circles – translating works of Nobel Prize-winning dramatist Jacinto Benavente – and later became involved in genealogical efforts; from 1940 to 1946 he was the 6th President of the Underhill Society of America, a family heritage organization. Underhill Jr. would himself later assume the presidency of this Society in the 1950s, reflecting his engagement with his family’s legacy.

Underhill’s mother was Louisa Man Wingate, the daughter of General George Wood Wingate. General Wingate was a Civil War veteran and an influential figure in marksmanship and early civil defense; he played a key role in founding the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the 1870s. Thus, from his mother’s side, Underhill inherited a connection to American military and firearms culture. Tragically, Louisa Wingate Underhill died in 1927 when John Jr. was only 12 years old. Her death left an indelible mark on the young Underhill, who was thereafter raised primarily by his widowed father. Growing up in Brooklyn, John Jr. was exposed to both the intellectual pursuits of his father – who fostered a love of languages and literature – and the martial legacy of his maternal family, which likely spurred his early interest in weaponry and military affairs.

Underhill’s ancestry traced back to early colonial America. The Underhill family lineage includes Captain John Underhill (circa 1608–1672), a notable figure in 17th-century New England, though John Jr. was many generations removed from that line. The Underhill Society of America, which his father and later he himself led, was dedicated to researching and commemorating the family’s heritage in America. This suggests that Underhill took pride in his lineage and had a strong sense of identity rooted in American history. Such a background may have instilled in him a sense of duty and patriotism from a young age.

John Jr. had at least one sibling – sources are sparse on this, but records of the extended Underhill family indicate he may have had a sister or cousin involved in family activities. However, it appears John was the only son of his parents, and he would later pass on the family name to his own child, John Garrett Underhill III. Growing up in Brooklyn in the 1920s and 1930s, Underhill benefited from a comfortable, educated upbringing. The combination of his father’s scholarly milieu and his maternal grandfather’s military influence created a unique formative environment. Family anecdotes (preserved in Underhill Society newsletters) describe John Jr. as an inquisitive boy fascinated by mechanical things and history, often poring over his grandfather Wingate’s war mementos. He also developed a keen interest in firearms and marksmanship, likely encouraged by the Wingate side of the family. In later years, Underhill amassed a large private collection of foreign military small arms – particularly Soviet weapons – reflecting a lifelong passion that arguably began in his youth.

John Underhill Jr. attended high school in Brooklyn, though sources do not name the school. Given the family’s social status, it may have been a reputable preparatory school. One possibility is that he attended the Polytechnic Preparatory Institute (Poly Prep) or another well-regarded Brooklyn school, as his father had ties to the Brooklyn Polytechnic (Underhill Sr. graduated from the Polytechnic Institute in 1894). Regardless, John Jr.’s high school education prepared him for admission to Harvard College, which he entered in the mid-1930s.

## Education and Formative Influences

In 1933, at age 18, John Garrett Underhill Jr. matriculated at Harvard College. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1937. At Harvard, Underhill studied liberal arts; one source indicates he focused on linguistics, which would align with his father’s linguistic interests and John’s own later work as a translator and multilingual analyst. Harvard’s rigorous academic environment honed Underhill’s analytical skills and exposed him to classmates and professors who were shaping fields like international relations and military history on the eve of World War II. It is likely that Underhill took courses in history, government, or languages that fed his interest in global military affairs. He became proficient in multiple languages (later described as a linguist by colleagues) and developed a facility for analyzing foreign military developments – a skill that proved valuable in his career as an intelligence analyst.

During his college years, Underhill was influenced by the tumultuous events of the 1930s. The rise of militarism in Europe and Asia, and the looming threat of global conflict, would have been subjects of lively debate among Harvard’s faculty and students. Underhill’s own family background likely made him attuned to these issues: the Wingate family’s involvement in early civil defense and marksmanship, combined with the Underhill scholarly tradition, positioned John at the intersection of intellectual analysis and practical military concerns. He reportedly maintained a personal interest in firearms and military technology throughout this period. By the time he graduated in 1937, Underhill had begun assembling what would become an extensive collection of military weaponry and reference materials. This avocation was more than a hobby; it was essentially self-directed professional training. Indeed, Underhill would later be described as a “self-taught military affairs expert” who possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of armaments and tactics.

After Harvard, Underhill briefly stepped into the world of journalism and publishing, which would be one of his career paths. On June 12, 1940, he married Patricia Semple Dunkerson, a graduate of Vassar College. Their wedding at St. Bartholomew’s Church in New York City was announced in The New York Times, reflecting their social standing. Patricia “Pat” Dunkerson came from a well-connected family, and like John, she was college-educated at an elite institution. This partnership suggests that Underhill’s personal life was grounded in the same East Coast establishment circles that he moved in professionally. Pat Underhill would remain with John until his death; she is noted in records as his wife and the mother of their son, John Garrett Underhill III, born sometime in the mid-1940s (exact date unknown, but he was an adult by the 1980s). The stability of his family life through the 1940s and 1950s provided Underhill with personal support, even as his career took him into stressful and secretive domains.

## Early Career in Journalism (1938–1942)

Underhill’s first significant job after college was with Life magazine, at the time one of America’s most prominent weekly publications. From 1938 until 1942, John Garrett Underhill Jr. worked for Life as a pictorial journalist and researcher specializing in military affairs. He joined Life during a period when the magazine was building its reputation for photojournalism and international coverage. Underhill’s role is described as a “pictorial journalist,” implying that he helped curate and interpret photographs of military subjects, and possibly wrote analyses to accompany Life’s coverage of the brewing conflicts in Europe and Asia. Colleagues remembered him as a walking encyclopedia of military hardware and strategy, someone who could identify an obscure foreign artillery piece from a grainy photograph. This expertise made him a valued asset to Life’s Foreign News department. Indeed, Underhill has been credited with helping make Life’s war coverage unusually well-informed; by at least one account, he contributed to making the magazine’s Foreign News section “one of the most knowledgeable centers of military intelligence in the world”. While this characterization may be somewhat hyperbolic, it underscores Underhill’s emerging stature as a military analyst even before the United States entered World War II.

During 1938–39, as Life reported on the Spanish Civil War’s aftermath and the early aggressions of Nazi Germany, Underhill likely provided background briefs on weaponry and tactics. He was, by all evidence, entirely self-taught in these subjects, yet his passion and diligence filled gaps that even career military officers might have in identifying the latest foreign armaments. The skills he developed at Life – researching enemy equipment, compiling intelligence from photos and reports, and writing concise explanatory pieces – closely mirrored what an intelligence officer in the military might do. This unusual overlap between journalism and intelligence became a template for Underhill’s career.

With the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939, Life intensified its war coverage. Underhill continued to deepen his knowledge. It was during this time that he also began acquiring examples of foreign military weapons for his personal study. Over the next decade and a half, he assembled a “large private collection of Soviet small arms” which he used to educate himself on foreign weapon design. This endeavor was not mere collecting; it was practical research that made him even more invaluable as an analyst of foreign military power. By the early 1940s, Underhill’s name occasionally appeared in Life’s internal memoranda as someone who could advise on military content. Though he was in his twenties, he had already established a network of contacts among military experts and ordnance specialists.

In December 1941, the United States entered World War II. Underhill’s expertise did not go unnoticed by those in government. In 1942, as war mobilization peaked, Underhill left Life to join the war effort more directly. According to later CIA records, he left the magazine in 1942, presumably as America geared up to deploy its resources. Given his background, a logical step was military intelligence – and indeed, that is where he would soon serve.

## World War II Service: Military Intelligence (1943–1946)

With the nation at war, John Garrett Underhill Jr. was commissioned into the U.S. Army in mid-1943 to apply his skills in an official capacity. On July 8, 1943, he entered active duty as a Second Lieutenant with the Military Intelligence Service (MIS) in Washington, D.C. This was a branch of the Army’s General Staff G-2 section, responsible for collecting and analyzing military intelligence. Underhill’s commission and posting to MIS Washington indicates that he was recognized for his specialized knowledge. He was one of many educated young men rapidly brought into military service to bolster intelligence capabilities during WWII.

Underhill served with MIS for approximately two and a half years, from mid-1943 until early 1946. His duties were multifaceted but centered on technical intelligence. Specifically, he worked on preparing “technical and photographic headings for MIS publications” and on the evaluation of intelligence regarding enemy uniforms, insignia, and weapons. In practice, this meant Underhill was helping to produce intelligence bulletins and handbooks for the U.S. military that detailed the equipment and organization of enemy forces (primarily the German and Japanese armies, and possibly Soviet forces as well for long-term strategic planning). Given his pre-war experience at Life, he was well-suited to analyze aerial reconnaissance photos, captured enemy documents, and equipment. His linguistic ability would have been useful in translating or interpreting foreign manuals. He also likely wrote reports summarizing the capabilities of various enemy weapon systems, from firearms to tanks.

By combining his journalistic skill set with military structure, Underhill thrived. He rose to the rank of Captain and was assigned to the War Department General Staff, G-2. In October 1945, as the war concluded, Underhill received a War Department staff citation for “superior work in military intelligence”. This award attested to the high quality of his contributions. Additionally, he was awarded the Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM) for meritorious service during the war – an honor specifically noted on his gravestone. The inscription on his burial marker at the Underhill Burying Ground in Lattingtown, New York reads: “Captain, General Staff G2, World War II, ARCOM”, reflecting pride in his service.

Underhill’s responsibilities in MIS placed him in the heart of intelligence work in Washington. He worked closely with other officers on the flow of information about Axis forces. It is possible he contributed to the official Handbook on German Military Forces or similar reference works that were compiled by G-2 for field use. A contemporary church publication in his home region later recognized his role, underscoring how he applied his technical expertise in photography and enemy materiel to the war effort.

One notable project after the war’s end was Underhill’s “Report on the Red Army,” published on October 16, 1949 under the pseudonym “Garrett Underhill”. Though this came after he left active duty, it was likely informed by research begun during his time in MIS. The report was an extensive analysis of the Soviet Army’s capabilities and was likely circulated among policy circles interested in the Soviet threat as the Cold War began. In that report, Underhill is described as a writer and editor who served 3½ years on the War Department General Staff, and it notes his 15-year interest in foreign armaments (counting back to the mid-1930s) and his large private collection of Soviet weapons. The “Report on the Red Army” demonstrates that Underhill remained deeply engaged in military intelligence analysis immediately after WWII and was considered knowledgeable enough that his work was published and read by others concerned with national security.

Underhill’s military service formally ended in May 1946, when he left active duty. With demobilization, many wartime officers returned to civilian life, and Underhill was among them. However, unlike some who shed their military roles entirely, Underhill effectively transitioned his wartime specialty into peacetime endeavors, continuing to function as a kind of freelance military intelligence analyst in the coming years. Notably, his connections to the intelligence world did not sever upon leaving the Army; instead, they evolved into more informal and covert relationships.

## Postwar Career and Intelligence Connections (1946–1950)

After WWII, Underhill settled back into civilian life in Washington, D.C., and New York City, navigating a dual identity as both a journalist and a behind-the-scenes intelligence asset. In the late 1940s, he took on writing assignments while also remaining in touch with former military and new intelligence contacts. By virtue of his wartime record and specialized knowledge, Underhill was of interest to the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which was established in 1947 from its predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and the Central Intelligence Group. Although Underhill had not been an OSS officer (his service was with Army G-2, not OSS), he was precisely the type of person the CIA sought out for expertise on foreign militaries and as potential part-time “contacts” for information.

In February 1949, CIA officials in the New York Office of the Office of Operations (OO), Contacts Division, considered using Underhill as a confidential contact for foreign intelligence. An internal CIA memorandum from that time notes the interest in leveraging Underhill’s knowledge and connections. The Agency ran “name checks” on him with various military members of the intelligence community, essentially vetting his background. These checks yielded no derogatory information but did advise caution – suggesting Underhill be developed as a contact on a limited basis and not be given any classified information above Confidential level. In short, CIA found Underhill potentially useful but intended to handle him carefully, likely because he was an outside civilian and a journalist who could not be fully controlled. This relationship was indeed established: Underhill became an infrequent contact of the CIA’s Domestic Contact Service from the late 1940s into the mid-1950s. According to a CIA summary, “the contact was routine” and Underhill was never an employee of the CIA. He essentially acted as a friendly source or consultant whom the Agency could debrief occasionally about information he picked up in military and journalistic circles.

During this period, Underhill also pursued journalism and writing. He co-authored articles that drew on his military insight. One notable piece was a 6,500-word essay titled “The Tragedy of the U.S. Army,” which Underhill wrote with journalist Ronald Schiller; it was published in Look magazine on February 13, 1951. This article critically examined the state of the U.S. Army in the early Cold War, presumably arguing that the Army was ill-prepared or under-resourced – an opinion Underhill held strongly. (A United Press summary of an Underhill article for Esquire similarly stated that Underhill described the U.S. Army as “shockingly weak” in the postwar period.) Underhill’s frank assessments of American military weakness reflect a perspective that was somewhat contrarian in the triumphalist post-WWII years. It indicates he was worried about complacency and saw potential threats (like the Soviet Union’s military growth) as requiring urgent attention.

The Look magazine piece gained enough attention that the Harvard Alumni Bulletin mentioned Underhill’s activity. In that alumni note, Underhill himself wryly noted that he “got recalled to brown suit service just after finishing a 6500-word article”. The phrase “brown suit service” likely meant returning to government service (as opposed to military “khaki” service) – perhaps a playful way to say he was tapped for some government consultancy or reserve duty. This might allude to his being called to assist in the Pentagon or intelligence community as the Korean War broke out in 1950, or possibly being asked to serve again in a civilian capacity given the insights he had just published. Indeed, the CIA’s files later noted that Underhill had said he served as a consultant “probably in 1955 to an Army coordinating group”, and also that he served in military intelligence in World War II and Korea. There is no indication Underhill donned a uniform again for the Korean War (1950–1953), but he may have served stateside in an intelligence or advisory role, perhaps in a civilian capacity for the Department of Defense. It’s possible that from 1951 to 1953, Underhill was intermittently involved in analyzing Soviet/Chinese military support to North Korea, or helping to train U.S. troops in recognizing Communist-bloc equipment. The reference to “consultant… to an Army coordinating group” in 1955 suggests he continued to be an occasional advisor as Cold War military planning evolved.

All the while, Underhill’s interactions with the CIA were ongoing but low-key. On March 12, 1957, CIA headquarters requested updated “national agency checks” on Underhill – essentially another background sweep, which implies renewed interest by the Agency’s Office of Security in him. This timing might correspond to Underhill being considered for a more formal role or clearance, or simply a routine update as he continued to pass along information.

An example of Underhill’s ad-hoc intelligence role is found in an incident from the late 1940s involving Soviet military photographs. In 1949, Underhill became aware of a man named Herman Axelbank who was trying to sell photographs of Soviet military subjects to American institutions. Axelbank was a well-known Russian émigré photographer who had a trove of Soviet military and industrial images. Underhill reported Axelbank’s approach to him – including that Axelbank had pictures which might be of interest – to both the FBI and CIA. He even traveled to Washington to alert the CIA, suggesting that Collier’s magazine might purchase some photos for a story on Russia. Underhill discussed Axelbank’s materials with Richard “Dick” Haskins, a CIA officer. This episode, confirmed in CIA files, shows Underhill acting as a helpful intermediary, funneling potentially valuable intelligence (in this case, imagery intelligence) to U.S. agencies. It also highlights how Underhill’s worlds of journalism and espionage blended: he knew editors who might publish on Soviet topics and simultaneously knew whom to tell in intelligence if something noteworthy came along. CIA documents indicate Underhill took care to handle sensitive information properly – for instance, he did not himself buy the Axelbank photos and reveal them publicly, but instead alerted authorities. Such cooperation earned him trust as an unofficial asset.

By the end of the 1940s, Underhill had firmly established a pattern that would define the rest of his career: he operated on the fringes of official intelligence, not as a paid operative, but as a knowledgeable civilian whom agencies could consult or who could quietly tip off the government about relevant information. His value came from his access to military circles, the media, and even international contacts, and from his reputation as an authority on limited warfare and small arms. Indeed, one CIA memo later summarized that “J. Garrett Underhill had been an intelligence agent during World War II and was a recognized authority on limited warfare and small arms”. This recognition did not mean he held an official post after the war, but his name was known among intelligence professionals.

## Civil Defense and Controversy in Washington (1954–1955)

In the mid-1950s, John Underhill Jr. took on a role that brought him into the public eye: he became involved in civil defense planning for Washington, D.C. Following the detonation of the first Soviet nuclear weapons, the U.S. government in the early 1950s was heavily focused on civil defense – preparing cities for potential atomic attack. Underhill volunteered and served as Deputy Director for Civil Defense of Washington, D.C. in the 1950s. His responsibilities included helping to draft and implement evacuation plans, public safety drills, and coordination with federal Civil Defense Administration initiatives.

In June 1955, a large-scale national drill known as “Operation Alert” tested the readiness of cities, including Washington, for a hypothetical hydrogen bomb attack. Underhill participated in this exercise, but he grew highly critical of what he saw. He publicly stated that the civil defense drill was essentially a farce: not a real drill but a “show” put on for appearances. According to press coverage at the time, Underhill refused to follow certain protocols during the exercise, such as evacuating to the designated command post, because he believed the plan was wholly inadequate. He was quoted as saying the civil defense setup was “so inadequate it couldn’t cope with a brushfire threatening a doghouse in a backyard” – a withering assessment of the preparedness level (this colorful quote is attributed to Underhill in secondary sources summarizing the incident). Underhill’s outspoken dissent did not sit well with his superiors. The Commissioner of the District of Columbia, Samuel Spencer, upon learning of Underhill’s public criticism, promptly ordered his dismissal at the very moment the Operation Alert drill was underway. In other words, Underhill was fired on the spot for insubordination and for embarrassing the civil defense authorities with his candid remarks.

This episode revealed several facets of Underhill’s character and views. It demonstrated his willingness to challenge official narratives and to speak truth to power when he felt the public was being misled. Operation Alert was indeed criticized by many observers (including pacifist protestors in some cities) as being unrealistic. Underhill, with his analytical mind, likely calculated that in a real nuclear attack, the evacuation plans would fail disastrously. By voicing that truth, he sacrificed his position. His dismissal made brief news in Washington. The New York Times on June 16, 1955, for instance, described how even as “the President and his aides leave Washington before [the] mock hydrogen bomb attack” as part of the drill, one civil defense official (Underhill) had broken ranks by lambasting the exercise. The incident may have tarnished his prospects for a conventional government career, but it burnished his reputation as an independent-minded expert. Importantly, it also indicates Underhill was not simply a cheerleader for the military-industrial establishment – he could be sharply critical of U.S. defense preparedness if he perceived incompetence.

After this controversy, Underhill stepped back from official civil defense work. However, his interest in the topic of nuclear survival did not wane. In fact, he channeled it into journalism. On January 15, 1962, The New Republic published an article titled “Shelter and Survival,” co-written by Asher Brynes and Garrett Underhill. This piece discussed do-it-yourself fallout shelters and the broader implications of civil defense in the nuclear age. Underhill’s collaboration with Brynes (who was an editor at The New Republic) shows that he continued to influence public discourse on civil defense and nuclear strategy, using his insider knowledge. The article was accompanied by a cartoon in the magazine – a darkly humorous illustration of people peering out of a bomb shelter under a graveyard, underscoring the grim skepticism that Underhill and Brynes likely conveyed in their text. The fact that Underhill co-authored this in a prominent opinion journal indicates he remained an active voice in policy debates, at least within the intellectual press. It also establishes the working relationship and friendship between Underhill and Asher Brynes, which would prove significant later.

Parallel to these endeavors, Underhill kept up his family and social engagements. From 1954 to 1956, he served as the 9th President of the Underhill Society of America, succeeding his cousin Robert Underhill. In this role, he likely presided over genealogical meetings and publications, helping to revive the family organizations as he had expressed interest in doing. Though largely ceremonial, this position demonstrated Underhill’s continued connection to his heritage and community. He corresponded with Underhill relatives and organized events – a far cry from his clandestine intelligence work, but perhaps a comforting constant in his life. One November 1950 letter captures his enthusiasm for “the revival of the three Underhill organizations,” suggesting he was an active booster of family unity.

## Connections to the CIA and Intelligence Community

Throughout the 1950s and into the early 1960s, Underhill maintained extensive contacts with the U.S. intelligence community and even allied foreign intelligence services. While never a CIA staff officer, he was part of the periphery of the Agency’s network of sources and collaborators. CIA memoranda from 1949 and 1957, as discussed, confirm that he was regarded as a useful asset (in informal terms) who could be approached for information or who might volunteer leads.

Underhill was on first-name terms with a number of high-ranking CIA officials – social connections he had likely cultivated since the war. A declassified CIA biographical memo in 1967 explicitly states Underhill “was on intimate terms with a number of high-ranking CIA officials”. He was considered one of the Agency’s “un-people” (or “gun-people,” as some sources interpret it) who performed special assignments for them on a one-off basis. This intriguing label suggests that Underhill was part of a cadre of private individuals the CIA would discreetly task or consult when their particular expertise was needed, especially in areas like arms and military technology. Indeed, Underhill’s knowledge of foreign weaponry and contacts in the arms trade likely made him a go-to person for certain intelligence queries.

One significant connection was Underhill’s friendship with Samuel Cummings, one of the world’s leading private arms dealers in that era. Cummings was a former CIA operative who left the Agency and in 1953 founded an arms trading company, Interarmco (International Armament Corporation). Interarmco, headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia (with branches in Europe and Canada), supplied weapons globally and counted the U.S. CIA among its customers. Underhill and Cummings were known to be friends at one time. This friendship likely stemmed from their shared fascination with weaponry and possibly overlapping work – Cummings had been acquiring foreign weapons for the CIA in the early 1950s before going private, and Underhill was studying many of the same weapons. The Ramparts article later noted that Underhill was “on intimate terms” with CIA officers and specifically cited that “at one time he had been a friend of Samuel Cummings of Interarmco, the arms broker that numbers among its customers the CIA”. This connection placed Underhill in the midst of a shadowy network dealing in arms and intelligence.

Interarmco was infamous (or famous, depending on perspective) for its reach. It even indirectly had a connection to the JFK assassination: Interarmco sold rifles to Klein’s Sporting Goods in Chicago, and Lee Harvey Oswald’s mail-order Carcano rifle was purchased from Klein’s. This ironic link was noted by Ramparts, though it does not imply Underhill had any role in that transaction – it simply illustrates the nexus of covert operations, arms dealing, and eventual historical events that Underhill was adjacent to.

Underhill’s exact role with Interarmco remains a bit mysterious. There were rumors that in the late 1950s he actually worked for Cummings or with him. A CIA report mentions that “it was also reported that he [Underhill] showed a BND (West German intelligence) representative a copy of a purchase order for the procurement of a Soviet T-54 tank, the order having originated with Xerox Corporation in New York, and that he left Xerox to work with Cummings at Interarmco”. This single sentence, tucked into a CIA memo, is packed with intrigue. It suggests that Underhill at one point was employed by Xerox (perhaps in a corporate security or technical capacity – Xerox was developing photocopier tech then and maybe had defense contracts). During that time, he somehow came across a purchase order for a Soviet T-54 tank – possibly an order that Cummings or an associate had placed (Interarmco sometimes procured exotic hardware, and a T-54 tank would have been of high interest to Western intelligence in the 1950s). Underhill reportedly even shared this information with someone from the BND, implying he had direct contact with West German intelligence. This might have been done in a liaison capacity, or simply informal conversation among intelligence aficionados. The same report indicates Underhill left Xerox to join Interarmco, meaning he may have formally taken a job with Cummings’ company. If true, Underhill would have been actively engaged in the international arms trade and perhaps in gathering foreign matériel for study. However, the phrasing “it was also reported” suggests this information was second-hand and not fully verified by CIA. It may have been a lead that CIA had heard and included in Underhill’s file as a possibility.

Nonetheless, Underhill’s ties to Cummings are credible given their mutual interests, and Cummings’ known history. Sam Cummings himself had an interesting trajectory: born in Philadelphia in 1927, he joined the CIA in 1950 and specialized in purchasing foreign weapons for the Agency. He resigned in late 1953, married a German woman, and went fully private by 1954, creating Interarmco. CIA documents characterize Cummings as engaging in “sharp practices” and being “extremely difficult to control” in his business. That Underhill gravitated toward working with such a figure suggests that Underhill was comfortable operating in the grey areas between government service and private enterprise – where profits, politics, and espionage intersected. Through Interarmco, Underhill would have had access to cutting-edge intelligence on global arms trafficking and clandestine operations, since Cummings was involved in supplying weapons for CIA-backed projects (including arming anti-Communist forces in various countries).

Simultaneously, Underhill remained a media man. In the early 1960s, his work with The New Republic (as exemplified by the shelter article) and a noted role as a research assistant to Charles J.V. Murphy of Fortune magazine around 1963, kept him in the realm of journalism. Charles Murphy was a former speechwriter for President Eisenhower and a writer on defense for Fortune. If Underhill served as Murphy’s researcher, he likely contributed data and insight to Fortune articles on military topics. It put him at the heart of establishment journalism on defense issues, even as he kept one foot in the murky intelligence world.

In summary, by the early 1960s, John Garrett Underhill Jr.’s network was expansive. He had contacts in the CIA, the BND, the Pentagon, think tanks, and the press. He moved fluidly among these circles, which was both the source of his strength and perhaps his vulnerability. People who knew him professionally recognized him as a “free agent” intelligence expert – not beholden to any single agency’s bureaucracy. This independence gave him a unique perspective, but it also meant that if he stumbled upon dangerous knowledge or ran afoul of powerful interests, he had limited institutional protection. These connections set the stage for Underhill’s final, and most controversial, chapter of life: his reaction to the Kennedy assassination and the secrets he claimed to know.

## The JFK Assassination and Underhill’s Allegations

On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. This earth-shattering event had myriad immediate effects; among them, it sent shockwaves through the intelligence community and those orbiting it. John Garrett Underhill Jr., with his deep ties to intelligence circles, reacted in a dramatic and personal way. According to later accounts, Underhill was deeply disturbed by the news of Kennedy’s murder. He became convinced almost immediately that it was not the work of a lone man, but rather the result of a conspiracy within the government – specifically within the CIA.

Underhill’s reaction was extreme enough that within hours of the assassination, he fled Washington, D.C. in fear for his life. The day after the assassination (November 23, 1963), Underhill abruptly left the capital “in a hurry,” driving to the home of friends in New Jersey late that evening. Those friends were Robert and Charlene Fitzsimmons – a married couple who knew Underhill socially. Charlene Fitzsimmons later recounted that Underhill arrived unannounced, very agitated and seemingly terrified. She noted that he was sober (he emphasized he hadn’t been drinking) but emotionally “unstrung,” oscillating between rage and panic. Underhill confided in Charlene a stunning claim: he said a small clique within the CIA was responsible for Kennedy’s assassination.

Underhill told the Fitzsimmons in “great detail” what he believed was going on. As Charlene and Robert later described, Underhill’s story was roughly this: a self-contained faction inside the CIA was running a lucrative but highly illegal enterprise, involving gun-running, narcotics trafficking, and other contraband dealings, particularly in the Far East (Asia). This clique was using political intrigue and covert operations for its own ends – effectively a criminal cabal embedded within the intelligence apparatus. President Kennedy, Underhill said, had gotten wind of these rogue operations and was poised to “blow the whistle” on them. Therefore, in Underhill’s view, this CIA clique arranged to have Kennedy killed before he could expose or dismantle them. “Oswald is a patsy,” Underhill exclaimed to Charlene Fitzsimmons, meaning Lee Harvey Oswald was merely a scapegoat in a larger plot. Underhill raged, “They set him up. It’s too much. The bastards have done something outrageous. They’ve killed the President!”. He spoke of how CIA hardliners had tried something similar before: “They tried it in Cuba and they couldn’t get away with it… Right after the Bay of Pigs. But Kennedy wouldn’t let them do it. And now he’d gotten wind of this and he was really going to blow the whistle on them. And they killed him!”. This appears to refer to an alleged CIA plan to assassinate Fidel Castro or stage an “executive action” coup, which JFK supposedly stopped; Underhill believed those same elements turned on JFK himself.

The Fitzsimmons were stunned by Underhill’s diatribe. Charlene thought he sounded hysterical, even paranoid. Robert Fitzsimmons, who was initially asleep upstairs during Underhill’s outburst, later learned of it from Charlene and corresponded with a researcher about what Underhill had said. Robert’s summary confirmed the key points: Underhill alleged a corrupt faction in CIA involved in trafficking, that Kennedy got wise to them, and that they assassinated Kennedy to keep their activities secret. Underhill repeated to Charlene that he knew who “they” were and that “they know I know. That’s why I’m here. I can’t stay in Washington”. He implied he was in immediate danger because of what he knew. Indeed, Underhill asked the Fitzsimmons to shelter him – to let him stay with them for protection. Charlene, however, was unnerved and refused; she and her husband did not let Underhill spend the night. She tried to calm him and eventually got him to leave their home after he had rambled for about an hour and a half. Underhill reportedly said he might have to flee the country entirely, perhaps taking a freighter to Europe (he mentioned they were heading to Spain, and he might do the same).

After being turned away by the Fitzsimmons in New Jersey, Underhill’s movements are unclear. He presumably returned to Washington, D.C. His fears did not abate; he confided similarly in at least one other friend or associate in the weeks following. One often-cited name is Charlene Fitsimmons (the spelling sometimes varies, but it’s the same person), and another is an unnamed journalist friend. It appears, however, that Underhill did not contact the FBI, Secret Service, or any official body with his allegations. He might have realized he had no evidence beyond hearsay and his own suspicions, which official investigators would likely dismiss (especially since the FBI quickly embraced the lone gunman narrative). Also, if Underhill genuinely believed a CIA clique had murdered Kennedy, he might have doubted the trustworthiness of government channels to protect him or act on his information.

Underhill lived for about five and a half months after the JFK assassination. During this period, he kept a low profile publicly. Privately, though, he remained extremely fearful. He told friends that he “knew who they are” and thus believed “they” might come for him next. Some accounts suggest he was looking over his shoulder and perhaps considering how to safely tell someone what he knew. For instance, journalist Lincoln White recalled Underhill hinting that “if anything ever happened to him,” there were papers or letters that would explain why. However, no such documents have ever come to light conclusively (if they existed at all).

One important figure during Underhill’s final months was Asher Brynes of The New Republic, the same colleague with whom he had written the civil defense article. Brynes was working with Underhill on a writing project in 1964. They were likely collaborating on an article or report related either to Vietnam (which was heating up) or possibly to the aftermath of Kennedy’s assassination. Brynes later described Underhill’s demeanor in early 1964 as anxious and troubled, but Underhill did not explicitly tell Brynes about the secret he had blurted to the Fitzsimmons. It is possible Underhill was planning to confide in Brynes or use him to get the story out if he decided to go public. Given The New Republic’s liberal stance, an expose alleging a CIA rogue plot would have been explosive, and maybe Underhill was gathering courage or evidence for that.

## Mysterious Death in 1964

On May 8, 1964, John Garrett “Gary” Underhill Jr. was found dead in his Georgetown townhouse at 3035 M Street NW, Washington, D.C. He was 48 years old. His body was discovered by Asher Brynes, the writing collaborator from The New Republic, who had come by the house, accompanied by a medical student acquaintance. What they found was grim and perplexing. Underhill was lying on his bed, unconscious (or already deceased) from a gunshot wound to the head. A .380 caliber automatic pistol was at the scene. According to Brynes, the pistol was in Underhill’s right hand when found (some early reports said it was under his body on the left side – this discrepancy became a point of contention, but Brynes clarified to others that it ended up under the left side possibly after Underhill collapsed, but it was presumably in his right hand initially given he was right-handed). There were no signs of forced entry or struggle.

Underhill had been shot once behind the left ear. This wound location was highly unusual for a suicide by a right-handed person, as it would require an awkward contortion to self-inflict. However, it’s not impossible: a determined individual could hold a gun in the right hand and reach around the back of their head to fire behind the left ear. Still, it raised eyebrows. Brynes immediately found the scene suspicious, reportedly remarking “Odd” – Underhill was right-handed, yet the wound was on the left side. Brynes also noted that the pistol might have been fitted with a silencer (it was an automatic, possibly a Colt or similar pocket pistol), because neighbors in the apartment building did not recall hearing a gunshot recently. The state of Underhill’s body indicated he had been dead for at least a day or two before discovery. Indeed, friends had not heard from him for a couple of days, prompting Brynes to check on him.

The District of Columbia coroner conducted an inquiry, in consultation with the Metropolitan Police Homicide Division. The death was officially ruled a suicide, with the cause listed on the death certificate as “shot self in head with automatic pistol”. The date of death was recorded as May 8, 1964 (though it’s possible he actually died on May 6 or 7, but was found on the 8th). Underhill’s wife, Patricia, was not home at the time of his death; it appears she was living separately in that period (possibly they were estranged or she was away – indeed she was working in Washington and continued to live there after his death). The police found no suicide note. There was also no overt evidence of foul play: the door was reportedly locked from the inside. Underhill’s pistol was known to be owned by him. Given these circumstances, the authorities quickly and perhaps uncritically labeled it a suicide.

However, those who knew Underhill and were aware of his assassination fears had serious doubts. Asher Brynes himself harbored suspicions. He told journalist Jones Harris (a JFK assassination researcher in New York) about the odd details, and Harris later relayed these to others. Brynes thought the scene looked staged: the placement of the gun, the silent shot, and Underhill’s prior statements all pointed to something darker. The Fitzsimmons, upon hearing of Underhill’s death, were deeply unsettled. In correspondence years later, Charlene Fitzsimmons admitted she initially thought Underhill had gone mad, but the fact that he ended up dead not long after saying “they” would get him gave her pause.

Underhill’s family responded in a low-key manner. Patricia Underhill wrote to a concerned acquaintance, John Donovan, who had heard rumors from the Fitzsimmons about Gary’s shocking claims. In her letters (dated in mid-1964), Pat Underhill acknowledged her husband’s suicide, expressed grief, but did not hint at any conspiracy. When Donovan pressed for details about the manner of death, she replied with the sparse official facts (e.g. he died of a gunshot, ruled suicide), and she did not engage further when he asked follow-up questions. It appears Pat Underhill either did not believe foul play was involved or she chose not to pursue it. Perhaps she was unaware of Gary’s frantic claims (if they were estranged or if he shielded her, she might not have known). Or she may have accepted the official finding, not wanting to delve into dangerous territory. After John’s death, Pat continued her life quietly; she died in 1973, with a memorial service at Christ Church in Washington.

Gary Underhill was laid to rest in the Underhill family burying ground in Lattingtown, Long Island, the same cemetery where generations of Underhills were interred. His gravestone, as shown earlier, makes no indication of the dramatic circumstances of his death – it notes his military rank and dates. To the public in 1964, Underhill’s passing went virtually unnoticed. It was one of many suicides in Washington that year, and at the time, not connected overtly to the Kennedy assassination in news media. Only those in the know – a small circle of friends and certain intelligence insiders – remembered his dire warnings and were left to wonder if Underhill’s fate was indeed what he had feared.

## The Ramparts Article and CIA Response (1967)

For a couple of years after 1964, Underhill’s name remained obscure. It was not mentioned in the Warren Commission Report (1964), which concluded Oswald acted alone. However, the climate of skepticism about that conclusion was growing. In 1967, Ramparts magazine, an iconoclastic left-wing publication known for its investigative exposes (such as revealing CIA funding of student organizations), turned its attention to the JFK assassination and related mysterious deaths.

In its June 1967 issue, Ramparts published an article – likely authored by journalist William W. Turner (a former FBI agent turned critic of the Warren Commission) – that for the first time told the story of Gary Underhill to the public. The Ramparts piece (titled “The Inquest,” June 1967) recounted Underhill’s allegations and the suspicious aspects of his death in a two-page spread. It presented Underhill as a former CIA agent (a bit of a mischaracterization, since he was not a staff officer, but Ramparts used “agent” loosely) who had inside information on the assassination. The key passages from Ramparts said: the day after JFK’s assassination, Gary Underhill fled Washington to his friends’ home in New Jersey, “very agitated.” He confided to them that a “small clique within the CIA was responsible for the assassination” and that he feared for his life and might have to leave the country. The article continued, noting that “less than six months later Underhill was found shot to death in his Washington apartment. The coroner ruled it suicide”.

Ramparts provided Underhill’s background to lend credibility to his claims: “J. Garrett Underhill had been an intelligence agent during World War II and was a recognized authority on limited warfare and small arms”. It described him as a researcher and writer on military affairs who was on a first-name basis with Pentagon top brass, and “on intimate terms with a number of high-ranking CIA officials”. Importantly, Ramparts asserted that Underhill “was one of the Agency’s ‘un-people’ who perform special assignments” – essentially confirming the kind of relationship we have detailed. The article even mentioned Underhill’s connection to Sam Cummings and Interarmco, as discussed earlier, highlighting that link to CIA arms deals and ironically to Oswald’s rifle. In sum, Ramparts painted Underhill as a well-connected intelligence insider who knew too much.

Furthermore, Ramparts included more of what Underhill reportedly told the Fitzsimmons: it quoted the friends saying Underhill was sober but badly shaken, that he specifically blamed “a CIA clique… carrying on a lucrative racket in gun-running, narcotics and other contraband, and manipulating political intrigue to serve its own ends”. It mentioned Underhill’s claim that Kennedy got wind of it and was killed before he could blow the whistle. It noted the friends initially didn’t believe the CIA could have such a corrupt element but realized it might. The article cast doubt on the suicide verdict: citing Asher Brynes’ observations (shot behind left ear, gun on left side, etc.) and concluding “Underhill obviously had been dead several days” without anyone hearing a shot. Finally, Ramparts commented that “Gary Underhill’s chilling story is hardly implausible. As a spy apparatus the CIA is honeycombed with self-contained cliques operating without any real central control…”. This was a provocative statement in 1967, alleging that CIA had rogue factions – essentially validating Underhill’s thesis.

The Ramparts article caused a minor sensation in intelligence and assassination-research circles. While the mainstream media didn’t immediately amplify it, those following JFK conspiracy leads paid attention. One of them was New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who in 1967 was conducting a controversial investigation into JFK’s death (the trial of Clay Shaw). Garrison read voraciously anything related to the case, and he certainly took note of Underhill’s story in Ramparts.

Within the CIA, the Ramparts piece sparked concern. In July 1967, a memorandum marked SECRET–RYBAT (a special handling caveat) was prepared, addressing “Ramparts: John Garrett UNDERHILL Jr., Samuel George CUMMINGS, and INTERARMCO”. This CIA memo, dated 19 July 1967, appears to have been a briefing paper compiled in response to the Ramparts allegations, likely for internal use or to answer questions from the Justice Department or other officials about the Garrison investigation. The memo’s first section verbatim excerpts the Ramparts article passages about Underhill and even quotes the lines about the CIA clique and Underhill’s death being suspicious. Essentially, CIA was acknowledging what was being publicly alleged.

The memo’s second section reported the results of the Agency’s records check on Underhill. It provided a biographical rundown:
*   Born 7 August 1915 in Brooklyn.
*   Graduated from Harvard in 1937.
*   Died 8 May 1964, shot to death.
*   Served with Military Intelligence (MIS) from 6 July 1943 to May 1946 as an expert in photography, enemy weapons, etc.
*   Was in infrequent contact with the CIA (Domestic Contact Service, New York) from late 1949 to mid-1950s; the contact was routine, and “Mr. UNDERHILL was not an employee of CIA”.

This summary is notable: it admits Underhill’s connections but carefully downplays any idea that he was a CIA operative. The memo goes on to list Underhill’s known activities (essentially everything we covered in this biography): his work at Life (1938–42), his Army service and citation, CIA’s 1949 interest in him as a contact (with the caution to limit him), the 1957 security check, the Esquire article about a weak Army, his consultant role in 1955, and the Axelbank incident reported in 1949. In essence, CIA documented that Underhill was indeed who Ramparts said he was in terms of credentials. But the memo notably does not try to rebut Underhill’s assassination claims with any evidence; it simply catalogs his background. The final parts of the memo shift to information on Sam Cummings and Interarmco, implying that CIA was more concerned about what Ramparts hinted regarding Cummings (the arms dealing and Oswald rifle connection) as well. CIA traced Cummings’ career and confirmed he’d been a CIA staffer (GS rank) in 1950–53, then left and formed Interarmco in 1954. It mentioned that by the mid-50s Cummings was essentially out of CIA control.

Interestingly, one line near the conclusion of the CIA memo remarks that aside from the Ramparts article, any connection of Underhill to Garrison’s New Orleans investigation was “tenuous”. In fact, Garrison had not publicly mentioned Underhill by name at that point (mid-1967). The CIA likely anticipated that Garrison might seize on Underhill. Indeed, just a few months later, in October 1967, Garrison did reference Underhill (though not by name) in his famous interview with Playboy magazine. When asked by Playboy about a former CIA agent who supposedly claimed the CIA killed Kennedy, Garrison confirmed that such a man existed and had been “conveniently liquidated” in Washington, D.C., in May 1964. This was clearly Gary Underhill. Garrison told Playboy that this agent’s death was made to look like suicide but that he’d been shot behind the ear – echoing Ramparts. Garrison used Underhill’s story as part of his broad argument that a cabal in the CIA orchestrated Kennedy’s murder.

CIA’s internal memo had already armed the Agency with answers. When the Department of Justice relayed questions (likely from the FBI or to address Garrison’s allegations), the CIA responded with the biography of Underhill to show he wasn’t a regular agent and pointed out that the only evidence of his claims was that Ramparts article. The aim was to portray Underhill’s accusations as unsubstantiated hearsay from a distraught individual, and to reassure that CIA had nothing to do with him beyond casual contact.

From a historical perspective, the Ramparts piece and CIA’s response are a fascinating case study in claim and counterclaim. Ramparts took a speculative account (the Fitzsimmons story, likely obtained via independent assassination researchers such as Vince Salandria or Jones Harris) and published it without absolute proof, but with enough factual background to make it plausible. CIA, rather than directly confronting the claim of a “CIA clique,” sidestepped it, focusing on Underhill’s lack of official status. In doing so, CIA neither confirmed nor denied the existence of rogue elements – they simply ignored that assertion in their memo, as the New York Post later noted, calling the memo “anti-climactic” for not addressing Underhill’s actual allegations.

For Ramparts, publishing Underhill’s tale was part of a larger pattern of challenging the credibility of the Warren Commission and the CIA. The article also served as a notice to the public that several people with some tie to the assassination (Underhill included) had died suspiciously, feeding the burgeoning “mysterious deaths” narrative. It’s worth noting that Ramparts itself was under CIA scrutiny at the time (for other reasons), and some at CIA might have worried that Underhill’s case, if believed, could seriously damage the Agency’s reputation. The memo’s secret classification and the RYBAT tag indicate how sensitive CIA considered this.

In retrospect, the Ramparts article succeeded in rescuing Underhill’s story from obscurity and embedding it in JFK assassination lore. It also inadvertently ensured that CIA’s own files on Underhill would eventually become declassified proof of both his credentials and his claims, albeit viewed through a skeptical lens.

## Later Investigations: Garrison, the HSCA, and Others

Jim Garrison’s investigation in New Orleans (1967–1969) was the first official inquiry to incorporate Underhill’s story, albeit indirectly. Garrison had his staff look into various odd deaths and leads that might support his theory of a CIA–military industrial complex conspiracy against JFK. While Garrison never had the chance to interview Underhill (who was dead), he did mention him in media forums as a tantalizing example of a potential conspirator-turned-whistleblower who was silenced. In Garrison’s book On the Trail of the Assassins (published years later in 1988), he reiterated the Underhill anecdote, indicating he remained convinced of its significance. However, during the trial of Clay Shaw in 1969, Underhill’s case was not presented as evidence; it was too far removed from Shaw or New Orleans to be admissible or relevant in court.

After Garrison’s failed prosecution, interest in the JFK assassination persisted among independent researchers. Underhill’s name surfaced repeatedly in compilations of suspicious deaths. Journalist Penn Jones Jr., in his series Forgive My Grief (1966–1974), included Gary Underhill as one of the earliest “victims” connected to the case. Jones, an early Warren Report critic, succinctly recounted: “Gary Underhill was shot. This death was ruled suicide on May 8, 1964. Underhill was a former CIA agent and claimed he knew who was responsible for killing…”. Jones’s emphasis was on the pattern that people who “knew too much” tended to die conveniently.

In 1975, the U.S. Congress, spurred by new revelations (like CIA assassination plots abroad and the Watergate scandal), reopened questions about assassinations. The Senate’s Church Committee examined CIA abuses, and the House of Representatives established the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1976. The HSCA reinvestigated JFK’s assassination and collected data on many leads, including allegations of a conspiracy. Underhill’s name appears in HSCA archives, but it was a tangential part of their work. The HSCA investigated the phenomenon of witness deaths and concluded that while a number of witnesses (by broad definition) did die in the 1960s, statistical analysis didn’t prove a clear pattern of deliberate elimination. They did not find direct evidence linking Underhill’s death to the assassination plot. However, the HSCA did privately interview some who had information on peripheral stories. It’s possible Charlene or Robert Fitzsimmons were contacted (though there is no public record of their testimony).

One internal HSCA memo or file listing suspicious deaths likely included Underhill alongside figures like Dorothy Kilgallen, David Ferrie, and others. The committee, in its 1979 report, mentioned that critics of the Warren Commission point to cases such as Gary Underhill as suspicious, but the HSCA stopped short of endorsing those claims. They were more focused on acoustic evidence of a second shooter and CIA’s withholding of other information.

For assassination researchers outside the government, Underhill remained a topic of intrigue. In the 1980s and 1990s, writers like James DiEugenio revisited Underhill’s story in comprehensive critiques of the Warren Commission. DiEugenio’s Destiny Betrayed (first edition 1992) presents Underhill as a significant early whistleblower who confirmed a conspiracy in private. Conspiracy-oriented authors often connect Underhill with a string of early 1964 “convenient deaths” (others in that informal list include Navy officer Lt. William Pitzer, who died in 1966 allegedly by suicide but rumored murdered, and Mary Meyer, a friend of JFK who was killed in 1964). These narratives suggest that a clean-up operation eliminated people with inside knowledge. It must be stressed that evidence for this is circumstantial in Underhill’s case. No smoking gun (so to speak) has emerged, like a confession or a declassified file ordering Underhill’s death.

In 1992, the JFK Records Act was passed, leading to the declassification of thousands of assassination-related documents over the next few decades. Among these were CIA and FBI files that mentioned Underhill, including the full text of the 19 July 1967 CIA memo. When these were released in the late 1990s and 2017–2018, they provided primary-source confirmation of much of what had been pieced together: they showed CIA noted Underhill’s claims from Ramparts, detailed his bio, and had investigated his friend Sam Cummings. The public could see, in CIA’s own words, how Underhill described the rogue clique and how Brynes found the death scene suspect. This lent a new legitimacy to the Underhill story in the eyes of some, because it was no longer just an anecdote passed through the grapevine – it was documented in official archives.

For example, one CIA file from 1977 (declassified later) notes that Underhill’s death was among those frequently cited by critics as suspicious. The file doesn’t draw conclusions but acknowledges the pattern of allegations. The Newsweek magazine in 2017, when covering the latest JFK file releases, highlighted Underhill’s story with the provocative headline “CIA ‘Responsible’ for JFK Assassination, Agent Says in Released Files,” referring to Underhill as the “agent”. This shows how Underhill re-entered mainstream discourse as the result of declassified material. Similarly, major news outlets like the New York Post in 2025 summarized Underhill’s tale when discussing what the JFK files revealed: recounting his claim of a CIA clique, his flight to New Jersey, and the circumstances of his death.

The enduring question has been: Was Underhill telling the truth or was he delusional? Modern analysts are divided. Some, like author Gerald Posner (a defender of the lone gunman theory), shrug off Underhill’s account as uncorroborated and likely the product of paranoia or disinformation. They note there’s no direct evidence of the supposed CIA clique beyond what Underhill said, and that parts of Underhill’s narrative (like the tie-in to Far East drug-running) sound like anachronistic echoes of later CIA scandals (such as Air America in Laos or Contra drug trafficking in the 1980s) projected back onto 1963 without proof. Occam’s razor, they argue, would suggest Underhill took his own life due to mental distress. It’s known that in early 1964 Underhill’s father-in-law died, which might have exacerbated his depression; also, Underhill’s career had hit a lull (no longer in high-profile roles, perhaps financial strain).

On the other hand, researchers like DiEugenio and William Turner have pointed out how much of what Underhill claimed dovetailed with evidence that emerged later: the CIA did have unauthorized operations (e.g., plotting to kill Castro without JFK’s approval), and elements within the CIA were bitter toward Kennedy over the Bay of Pigs fiasco. They ask, how would Underhill have concocted such a scenario unless he had indeed heard it from CIA colleagues? Underhill’s close friendships in CIA (the “intimate terms” noted in CIA’s own memo) make it entirely plausible he picked up whispers of something awry. If we trust the Fitzsimmons’ testimony, Underhill had information specific enough (gun-running in the Far East, etc.) that it doesn’t sound like a random hallucination. Perhaps Underhill did stumble onto a real rogue operation – maybe not the Kennedy plot, but something unethical that fueled his suspicion of Kennedy’s death.

## Social and Political Views

John Garrett Underhill Jr.’s social and political views were shaped by his life experiences at the nexus of the military, academia, and journalism. In many respects, Underhill was a classic Cold War liberal anti-communist – fiercely patriotic and anti-Soviet, yet also skeptical of government incompetence and overreach. He was not a partisan figure in the traditional sense; there’s no indication he was active in any political party or campaign. Instead, his “politics” were reflected in his writings and public comments on defense issues.

During the 1940s and 50s, Underhill believed strongly in maintaining U.S. military strength. His articles criticizing the U.S. Army’s post-WWII weakness show he was a hawk on defense readiness, alarmed by budget cuts or complacency that, in his view, left America vulnerable. He was likely supportive of a robust stance against the Soviet Union. Yet, Underhill also had a contrarian streak – he distrusted glib reassurances and propaganda. The civil defense episode in 1955 demonstrated a kind of proto-“whistleblower” mindset: he exposed a truth (that the civil defense drill was inadequate theatre) even though it embarrassed authorities. This suggests he valued honesty and effectiveness over loyalty to bureaucratic narratives. It might also reflect a bit of elitist confidence – he trusted his own analysis (that the plan was flawed) more than the directives from above, a trait perhaps common to bright intelligence analysts who sometimes chafe at policy.

Socially, Underhill moved in elite circles but seemed somewhat of a lone wolf. He was equally at home in blue-blood environments (Harvard clubs, military officers’ gatherings) as he was in bohemian intellectual ones (The New Republic’s offices). He was a member of The Players in New York (a theatrical club inherited from his father’s connections) and rubbed shoulders with both Ivy League graduates and hard-nosed spies. Those who met him likely found him intense, knowledgeable, and perhaps a bit eccentric – the type to discourse at length about obscure firearms or historical battles.

Underhill’s work with Life, Look, Esquire, and Fortune indicates he was concerned with educating the public (or at least the readership) on military affairs. He often took a critical tone, which aligns with the role of a journalist who sees himself as a watchdog. For example, in the Fortune context, he may have contributed to articles warning of Soviet military advances or analyzing the failings of U.S. defense policy. And with The New Republic, a liberal magazine, his contribution on civil defense took a critical view of the government’s approach to protecting citizens from nuclear war, arguably a stance that advocates for the public’s right to not be misled by ineffective policies.

Despite his criticism of some U.S. policies, Underhill was no peacenik or radical leftist. He essentially believed in American ideals and in confronting the Communist threat – he simply wanted it done competently and transparently. He admired President Kennedy, by all indications, and was horrified at his murder. Underhill’s statements after the assassination brim with outrage at the betrayal of American democracy (“The bastards… They’ve killed the President!”). This shows emotional investment in JFK as a leader. It’s plausible Underhill supported Kennedy’s more restrained approach to covert operations after the Bay of Pigs (as Underhill referenced Kennedy stopping an “executive action” in Cuba). Thus, politically, Underhill might be described as a Kennedy liberal who nonetheless had close friends on the hardline anti-communist right (like CIA paramilitary types).

One affiliation Underhill had was with the National Rifle Association, likely inherited from his Wingate side. While not documented as a member, his grandfather’s role in founding the NRA and Underhill’s lifelong interest in shooting and arms suggest he respected Second Amendment culture. He maintained a private collection of arms and was known to demonstrate foreign weapons at gun clubs or to interested military friends. This was not unusual in the 1950s for men in military circles – in fact, it was considered patriotic to be knowledgeable about the enemy’s weapons. His expertise was so recognized that when Soviet premier Khrushchev visited the U.S. in 1959 and gifted some AK-47 rifles, anecdotally Underhill was consulted by U.S. officials for his evaluation of them (a story that circulates among gun enthusiasts).

Underhill’s genealogical work with the Underhill Society reflects a conservative inclination to honor heritage and family. In those activities, he mingled with descendants of old American families, exchanging historical research. That was apolitical, but it underscores that Underhill was very much part of the American establishment in background – not an outsider radical.

In summary, Underhill’s views were a blend of staunch anti-communism, technical pragmatism, and civic responsibility. He expected competence and loyalty from government servants (including CIA men), and when he perceived treachery within their ranks, it shattered him. Some have speculated that Underhill’s unraveling in 1963–64 was partially due to a crisis of faith: the very institutions and country he devoted his life to had, in his belief, been subverted from within. That shock, combined with fear, may have led to despair.

## Geographic Movements and Residences

John Garrett Underhill Jr.’s life took him to several key locations, though he remained an East Coaster at heart. His geographic journey can be summarized as follows:
*   **Brooklyn, New York (1915–1933):** Born and raised in Brooklyn, Underhill spent his childhood and teen years here. The family lived in Brooklyn Heights (addresses like Grace Court are noted in his father’s records). He attended high school in Brooklyn. Even after leaving for college, Brooklyn remained a familial anchor (his father lived there until his death in 1946, and family graves were in Long Island).
*   **Cambridge, Massachusetts (1933–1937):** For college, Underhill moved to Cambridge to attend Harvard. He likely resided in campus housing (dorms in Harvard Yard or houses on the Charles River). He returned to New York during summers. After graduating in 1937, he returned to New York.
*   **New York City (1937–1943):** Underhill’s early career with Life was based in New York City, where Life had its headquarters. He lived in Manhattan during this period, possibly in the vicinity of Life’s office (which was in Rockefeller Center). We know he married in NYC in 1940, after which he and Pat may have set up a home in Manhattan or Brooklyn. In 1937, city directory info placed him at 2 Grace Court in Brooklyn Heights with his father, but by 1940 he was likely living independently. New York remained important as his family (like his father, until 1946) and the Underhill Society were there.
*   **Washington, D.C. (1943–1964):** With his commission in the Army in mid-1943, Underhill relocated to Washington, D.C., which became his primary base for the next two decades. He worked at the Pentagon (or associated offices) during WWII. After the war, Underhill and his wife apparently decided to stay in the D.C. area, given the opportunities there in defense and government. They lived in Northwest Washington, a hub for professionals. By 1955, Underhill was certainly a D.C. resident, as he had the civil defense post. He and Pat’s address in the 1960s was the townhouse on M Street in Georgetown where he died. Georgetown in the 1960s was an upscale neighborhood popular with journalists and government officials – Underhill would have fit right in. Notably, his wife remained in D.C. even after his death, indicating they were well settled there.
*   **Intermittent travel:** Underhill’s work likely required frequent travel. In the late 1940s, as a CIA contact, he made trips to New York (the CIA’s Contact Division he liaised with was in NYC, and he visited CIA HQ in DC too for the Axelbank matter). He may have traveled domestically to military bases, defense industry sites, or archives for research. There’s also the matter of the friends in New Jersey – the Fitzsimmons lived there (some accounts said Long Island, but primary sources say New Jersey). It’s likely they were in northern New Jersey, which is essentially the NYC metro area. Underhill must have visited them often enough to consider their home a refuge in 1963. He drove there on a moment’s notice, implying it was within a few hours’ reach of D.C.
*   **International travel:** There is scant direct evidence of Underhill traveling abroad, but given his involvement with Interarmco and the nature of his interests, it’s plausible he traveled to Europe at least a few times. For example, Sam Cummings had warehouses in England and relationships in Germany; if Underhill worked with him, Underhill might have gone to London or Zurich (Interarmco’s Swiss branch) on business in the late 50s or early 60s. Also, Underhill mentioned possibly fleeing “to Spain” in 1963 – that could be a random idea, or he had a particular place in mind (perhaps because the Fitzsimmons were about to sail to Spain). There’s no record he actually went abroad then.
*   **Houston, Texas (indirectly):** Underhill’s son, John Garrett Underhill III, ended up in Houston, Texas (by the 1980s, his address was Memorial Drive, Houston). While this doesn’t directly bear on John Jr.’s life, it indicates that the family line continued away from the Northeast after Pat’s death (John III might have moved there for work and settled). Underhill Jr. himself doesn’t appear to have had any substantial connection to Texas aside from, ironically, investigating the events in Dallas from afar.

In Washington, Underhill’s haunts included the prestigious Cosmos Club (just speculation, but many intelligence people and academics mingled there), and venues like the Army-Navy Club or restaurants around Foggy Bottom. He also frequented New York regularly, evidenced by his continued Underhill Society involvement and possibly meetings with editors. It wouldn’t be surprising if Underhill also periodically visited family property on Long Island or friends in New England (the Wingate family had roots in New York State as well).

Underhill’s abrupt departure from D.C. on November 22, 1963 to New Jersey was highly out of character and underscores his panic. After that, he seems to have returned to D.C. and stayed put, possibly laying low. As of May 1964, he was still in the Georgetown house, indicating he didn’t relocate or go into permanent hiding elsewhere in those months. Perhaps he felt somewhat safer as time passed, or he couldn’t practically uproot his life.

Geographically, one poignant detail: Underhill died in the nation’s capital, a city he had served both in uniform and as a civilian. He was buried back in his native state of New York, rejoining his ancestors. The journey from Brooklyn to Cambridge to Washington and finally back to Long Island traces the arc of a life that, while outwardly successful and urbane, ended prematurely and tragically.

## Writings and Intellectual Contributions

John Garrett Underhill Jr.’s intellectual legacy lies in his extensive writings and analyses on military and intelligence matters. While he did not publish any single famous book, his output in the form of magazine articles, reports, and internal memos was significant. Through these, he contributed to the public understanding (and internal government knowledge) of mid-20th-century military issues.

Some of Underhill’s known published works include:
*   **Report on the Red Army (1949)** – a detailed analysis of the Soviet military. Published under the pseudonym Garrett Underhill on October 16, 1949, this report provided an early open-source warning about Soviet capabilities. It likely circulated among policymakers and scholars worried about the Cold War. Given the timing (just after the Soviet atomic bomb test), it was prescient.
*   **“The Tragedy of the U.S. Army” (Look, Feb 1951)** – co-authored with Ronald Schiller. In this essay, Underhill and Schiller argued that the U.S. Army was unready for the challenges of the Cold War, possibly citing issues like lack of funding, poor morale, or outdated strategy. Coming as the Korean War raged, it was a bold critique.
*   **UP article on the U.S. Army’s weakness (circa early 1950s)** – referenced by CIA as an article by Underhill for Esquire magazine and summarized by United Press, saying the Army was “shockingly weak”. The exact date isn’t given, but this might be a re-publication or summary of the Look piece or a separate op-ed Underhill did.
*   **Articles/Research for Fortune (early 1960s)** – as a research assistant to Charles Murphy, Underhill likely contributed to articles in Fortune dealing with military technology or national security. For instance, Murphy wrote on subjects like the defense department reorganization, the missile gap, etc. Underhill’s exact contributions aren’t credited, but he was behind the scenes.
*   **“Shelter and Survival” (The New Republic, Jan 15, 1962)** – co-authored with Asher Brynes. This article critically examined civil defense strategies and advocated for honest public policy regarding nuclear war survival. It combined Underhill’s technical knowledge (e.g., effectiveness of fallout shelters) with a policy argument. Such writing placed Underhill within the intellectual debate on nuclear strategy in the Kennedy era, aligning somewhat with other critics who felt too little was being done (or that what was done was misguided).
*   **Life Magazine contributions (1938–42)** – While we don’t have specific bylines, Underhill undoubtedly wrote captions, sidebars, or research notes for Life’s military-related stories. For example, Life published features on the Battle of Britain, on America’s rearmament, etc., and Underhill as a researcher would have input. The influence is indirectly noted by colleagues praising Life’s intelligence thanks to him.
*   **Translations or Literature (pre-1938)** – While his father was the notable translator, Underhill Jr. likely assisted or had an interest in languages. It’s possible he translated some technical documents from Russian or German for government use (not published publicly). For instance, he might have translated captured Soviet or German manuals during the war.

Underhill’s unpublished or private writings are even more intriguing, though largely lost to history. There were hints that he might have kept journals or notes. Some acquaintances believed he wrote down his thoughts on the JFK assassination. One friend, Philadelphia attorney Vincent Salandria, recalled being told that Underhill had mailed a packet of letters to someone as a safeguard, but no such packet has surfaced. The letters exchanged between John Donovan and Patricia Underhill in 1964, disclosed by researcher Fred Litwin, show Donovan inquiring if Gary left any message or explanation. Pat’s responses didn’t indicate any. Possibly Underhill’s fear and isolation prevented him from composing a coherent account. It’s tragic to consider that an intelligence analyst who prided himself on documentation died without leaving a final memo to explain his fears.

Underhill’s FBI and CIA files might contain reports that he authored in an official capacity. The CIA memo references Underhill reporting on Herman Axelbank’s photos; Underhill likely wrote a short report or letter to the FBI about that in 1949. If those could be found, they would add to his paper trail. Similarly, Underhill’s communications during his MIS service (e.g., contributions to the War Department Intelligence Bulletin) would be part of his oeuvre, albeit anonymous or classified.

One of Underhill’s talents was photography – not as an artistic pursuit but as an intelligence tool. He was an expert in photo interpretation. It’s possible he wrote internal guides on interpreting enemy insignia from photos or gave lectures whose transcripts survive in Army archives. There’s reference to a publication of the Memorial Church of All Angels in Twilight Park that recognized his role and possibly published something he wrote about war service (Twilight Park is in Haines Falls, NY – possibly a summer community where he gave a talk).

Though Underhill never wrote an autobiography or comprehensive work, his significance lies in the specialized knowledge he disseminated. For example, arms experts in the U.S. military benefited from his private weapons collection – Underhill would physically show them Soviet arms and discuss their characteristics, which in pre-internet days was invaluable. In that sense, he was a living reference work. If any transcripts or notes from those sessions exist, they too are part of his intellectual legacy.

Finally, Underhill’s voiced suspicions about the CIA and JFK can be considered a kind of oral testimony that later got recorded second-hand. His words through Charlene and Robert Fitzsimmons, and through what he told others like Charlene (whom he called “Charlie”), became part of the historical record when published by Ramparts and cited by numerous sources. While not written by Underhill himself, these statements are treated almost like primary source quotes from him. In historical analyses, they carry weight (albeit controversial weight). Therefore, one could say Underhill’s final “contribution” was to seed the idea – decades before it was widely entertained – that the assassination of President Kennedy involved a conspiracy at high levels of U.S. intelligence.

Underhill’s contemporaries might have scoffed at that notion in 1964; but by the 1970s, after Watergate and the Church Committee, the idea that a clique in CIA could undertake unsanctioned, illegal operations no longer seemed far-fetched. In that regard, Underhill’s warning was ahead of its time. His story influenced a generation of assassination researchers to be skeptical of official accounts and to dig deeper into the connections between intelligence agencies and political violence.

## Death and Conspiracy Theories: Analysis

The circumstances of John Garrett Underhill Jr.’s death have fueled conspiracy theories since the late 1960s. To assess these theories, one must examine the evidence on both sides.

Evidence supporting the suicide verdict:
*   **Personal Turmoil:** Underhill’s emotional state after JFK’s assassination was, by all accounts, fraught. Charlene Fitzsimmons thought he had become “hysterical, paranoid or something”. If Underhill truly believed powerful men wanted to kill him, and if he felt powerless to stop them or reveal the truth, he might have sunk into depression or despair. Survivors of underworld pressure sometimes do take their own lives out of fear. Underhill’s friend Charlene explicitly said “Charlie thought he had gone completely mad” after he left their home that night. If Underhill himself worried he was losing his mind or couldn’t convince anyone, that could be a factor.
*   **Lack of a Struggle:** The scene in Underhill’s home showed no signs of a fight. For murder by an intruder, one might expect a forced entry or a scuffle. The door being locked from inside suggests either suicide or a very clever staging by an assassin who left without a trace (some suggest the lock could have been latched by a departing killer using a string – a bit far-fetched but not impossible for a skilled covert agent). Still, no evidence of another person was found.
*   **Gun in Hand:** Although its position was debated, the official police finding was that the gun was found with Underhill. This is consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot (whereas a murderer might have taken the weapon or tossed it aside, unless staging a suicide carefully). The coroner and police had no incentive to cover up; if something looked off, one might think they would at least classify it as “undetermined” or investigate more. The relatively quick ruling of suicide implies the forensic and investigative evidence pointed that way.
*   **Timing:** Underhill died nearly half a year after JFK’s assassination. If there were an immediate cleanup, one might expect him to be eliminated within days or weeks, not months later. By May 1964, the Warren Commission was well underway. Why would conspirators wait so long? One argument is they hoped Underhill would stay quiet, but when rumors of his outburst perhaps started spreading in certain circles, they acted. Indeed, Jones Harris only heard about Underhill’s claim in 1967 via the grapevine; it wasn’t widely known. The delay could cut both ways in interpreting foul play.
*   **Psychological Profile:** Underhill was underemployed in 1964 compared to his heyday, which might have caused a sense of aimlessness. He had been dismissed publicly in 1955, which could have been humiliating. Some who look at his case speculate he might have had a latent mental illness (some form of paranoid disorder triggered by stress). No medical records indicate that, but in that era such things often went undiagnosed. If his wife noticed erratic behavior, she never spoke of it, but she might have kept it private.

Evidence supporting murder (conspiracy) theory:
*   **Underhill’s own prediction:** The strongest circumstantial evidence is Underhill’s prior statements. He literally said, “They know I know… That’s why I can’t stay [in DC]”. He feared being killed. When such a person then turns up dead by an unusual gunshot, it’s hard to ignore the possibility that he was right. As the Ramparts article put it, Underhill’s story becomes “hardly implausible” in light of his fate. It’s akin to someone saying “my brakes will be sabotaged” and later having a fatal car accident – suspicion arises naturally.
*   **Physical oddities:** The bullet entry behind the left ear for a right-hander is one of the most cited points. Very few suicides shoot themselves behind the ear; the temple or mouth are far more common. In cases where behind-ear wounds are present, it’s often because the person used their non-dominant hand or twisted around. Brynes’ account has been used to say Underhill couldn’t have done it to himself easily. Moreover, the notion that a silencer might have been used so neighbors didn’t hear a shot suggests an assassin scenario. If Underhill shot himself, why would he use a silencer? People do sometimes use makeshift silencers to not disturb neighbors in a suicide, but it’s not typical.
*   **Time of death:** Underhill was apparently dead for days before discovery. If he killed himself, that means no one checked on him – plausible if he became reclusive. If someone killed him, doing it and leaving him to be found later achieves the same cover as a suicide. By the time he was found, any perpetrator was long gone.
*   **Pattern of similar deaths:** Underhill’s death doesn’t stand alone. In the JFK saga, several people who raised suspicions or had tangential info died violently: e.g., David Ferrie (a suspect in Garrison’s case) allegedly killed himself in 1967 in New Orleans, though Garrison argued it was murder disguised as natural causes; Guy Banister (New Orleans private investigator linking Oswald to anti-Castro activities) died of an ostensibly accidental shooting in 1964; and others (Dorothy Kilgallen, a journalist who interviewed Jack Ruby, died of a mysterious overdose in 1965). While each case individually is debatable, collectively they create an impression that something sinister may have been happening to those on the edges of the truth. Underhill’s is one of the earliest of these, often cited by conspiracy researchers in lists of “suspicious deaths”.
*   **Intelligence Modus Operandi:** If one entertains that a CIA rogue group did kill JFK, then eliminating Underhill, who was one of their own circle but dissenting, is within the realm of their capabilities. The CIA (or any intelligence service) certainly knows how to make murders look like suicides. By 1964, CIA had been involved in various assassination plots abroad (as later revealed), although doing one on U.S. soil is a bigger leap. Also, Underhill’s death happening in D.C. – practically in CIA’s backyard – could be seen as sending a message to others who might talk.
*   **Aftermath:** No follow-up investigation. If Underhill were murdered, one might expect that if any local detective had doubts, he might pursue it. The lack of any known follow-up could be due to a cover-up or intimidation from higher-ups to quickly close the case. Conversely, if it was clearly a suicide, no follow-up would be needed. We don’t have details on the police’s internal deliberations; all we have is the certificate note that the coroner conferred with homicide and both agreed it was suicide. The speed of that conclusion could raise eyebrows.

In trying to resolve these competing narratives, some have proposed a middle ground: Perhaps Underhill did kill himself, but not because he was insane – rather because he truly feared a conspiracy that he could not escape. In that scenario, the “conspiracy” killed him indirectly by pushing him to suicide. Underhill’s own quote to Charlene – “I know who they are… They know I know” – is haunting either way. If true, it meant he believed a deadly secret was in his head. Whether that secret was real or imagined, it overwhelmed him.

As of today, no conclusive new evidence has emerged to settle Underhill’s cause of death. The gun and bullet would have been key evidence – if someone could find the ballistics report or the pistol itself (in 1977, a House committee might have looked if it had reason). Some researchers suspect Underhill’s gun had a silencer attachment; if so, was that found? We don’t have that detail.

Given the controversy, modern investigators often approach Underhill’s case with caution. Academic historians might mention it as a curious footnote rather than proof of conspiracy. Conspiracy writers, however, often elevate Underhill to almost a martyr figure – “the CIA agent who said his colleagues killed Kennedy and was himself rubbed out.” The truth likely lies somewhere in between: Underhill was not a fantasist plucked from nowhere; he was a well-informed man whose sudden outburst indicates he encountered or deduced something alarming. But we lack corroboration of the specifics he alleged (names of clique members, details of operations, etc.).

In the world of JFK assassination studies, Underhill’s story is a tantalizing thread. If one were writing a spy thriller, Underhill would be the archetypal character of the insider who tries to expose the villainy but ends up silenced. In reality, what we have are fractured pieces of one man’s crisis. As a result, Underhill remains a figure about whom theories flourish in the absence of absolute clarity.

## Posthumous Reputation and Modern Analysis

Today, John Garrett Underhill Jr. is remembered primarily in two contexts: by intelligence/military historians for his expertise and service, and by JFK assassination researchers for his dramatic allegations and mysterious death. His legacy is thus dual – on one hand, a commendable career in defense analysis; on the other, a cautionary tale at the heart of conspiracy literature.

Among intelligence historians and enthusiasts, Underhill has gained recognition as an interesting minor figure of the WWII and Cold War era. Declassified personnel files (Army and CIA) confirm his contributions to military intelligence. Researchers of military history note that Underhill was part of the “military intellectuals” who bridged civilian and military work in the 1940s. His name might appear in footnotes about Life magazine’s pre-war preparations or in discussions of early CIA contacts. For example, scholars examining the CIA’s Domestic Contact Service now cite Underhill as an example of how the CIA used private citizens in the 1950s to gather information. He has even been referenced in studies of arms trading history – e.g., that CIA memo on Cummings has been used by historians to illustrate CIA’s uneasy relationship with private arms dealers. In that memo, Underhill is a key subject, linking to Cummings, which inadvertently put Underhill’s bio into the public archive.

The Underhill Society of America, which still exists, also preserves his memory in a genealogical sense. In lists of past Society presidents, his name and term (1954–1956) are proudly listed. Family newsletters occasionally mention the “mysterious death” of one of their own, though the Society’s focus isn’t on such controversies. Isaac Underhill, a Society historian (perhaps the Isaac Kremer who took the gravestone photo), wrote a blog entry on Underhill, highlighting both his accomplishments and the intrigue of his death. Thus, within the Underhill family network, John Jr. is remembered with a mix of pride and puzzlement.

In the JFK assassination research community, Underhill’s posthumous reputation is significant. He often features in documentaries or books that list mysterious JFK-related deaths. For instance, the History Channel or similar will include a segment on “Gary Underhill, the CIA man who supposedly knew the truth.” Typically, the narrative recounts Underhill’s story much as we’ve done, with reenactments of him telling friends “Oswald is a patsy” and then cut to the scene of detectives at his apartment. While compelling, these presentations sometimes oversimplify (calling him a “CIA agent” outright, which, as we’ve seen, is not entirely accurate). Nonetheless, Underhill has become part of the lore alongside names like Lee Bowers, Dorothy Kilgallen, and Jack Ruby in discussions of unnatural deaths tied to the case.

Modern writers who are critical of conspiracy theories have analyzed Underhill’s case as well. For example, Fred Litwin – an author who often challenges Garrison’s claims – wrote a detailed article “Was Gary Underhill the Man Who Knew Too Much?” in 2021. Litwin dug into primary sources, including interviewing family correspondents and reviewing FBI files, to argue that Underhill’s story has been exaggerated. He found that Underhill indeed made the statements attributed to him, but Litwin leans toward the interpretation that Underhill was suffering from severe anxiety or paranoid delusions by that point, and that his suicide was, sadly, real. Litwin’s view is that there’s no evidence Underhill had direct knowledge of a plot – he might have had suspicions like many did, but nothing concrete – and that conspiracy writers have mythologized him.

On the other hand, pro-conspiracy researchers like James DiEugenio continue to give Underhill’s account credence. In DiEugenio’s updated Destiny Betrayed (2012 edition), he dedicates space to Underhill, painting him as one of the brave insiders whose death should raise red flags. DiEugenio often criticizes those who dismiss Underhill as being unstable, pointing out that Underhill’s background was impressive and that labeling him “paranoid” conveniently ignores the possibility he was actually in danger.

The release of official documents has, to some extent, vindicated portions of Underhill’s claims. For example, the CIA’s own admission that Underhill was well-connected and that he fingered a CIA clique (as per the quotes they reproduced) means that we know he did say these things and wasn’t a mere rumor. Also, subsequent revelations about CIA operations – like the mid-1960s involvement in Southeast Asian drug trafficking by some elements, or the plots against Castro – show that rogue or semi-rogue cliques did operate. Underhill’s scenario of a clique doing gun-running and narcotics in the Far East sounds eerily like the activities of certain CIA-associated Air America crews in Laos in the late 1960s. Underhill could have only guessed this in 1963 (since those escalated later); however, it’s possible such things had earlier origins or he knew certain personalities inclined that way. Modern historians like John Prados or David Talbot, who explore CIA’s dark corners, often mention that an early warning of CIA rogue behavior came from insiders who were appalled – Underhill can be counted among those.

For the mainstream, Underhill’s story remains relatively obscure. The average history of the Kennedy assassination might footnote him at most. But the Internet age has given his tale new life. In late 2022 and early 2023, when President Biden ordered the final JFK files released, Underhill’s memo made headlines on social media. Tweets went viral quoting the Ramparts/CIA memo line: “A small clique within the CIA was responsible for the assassination… Underhill feared for his life… six months later he was shot to death, ruled a suicide”. People unacquainted with the story reacted with shock, as if it were a fresh revelation (even though it had been known in communities for decades). This demonstrates how Underhill’s narrative can still startle and capture imaginations when presented to a new audience. Fact-checkers like Politifact and news outlets then stepped in to clarify: Yes, those are real declassified lines, but they originate from the 1967 Ramparts story being summarized, not from a CIA whistleblower per se.

As with many historical figures caught up in controversy, Underhill’s reputation thus oscillates between “brave truth-teller” and “tragic paranoid,” depending on who assesses it. Modern analysis tends to be more sympathetic to Underhill as a person. Writers acknowledge that he believed what he was saying – there’s little sense he was lying. The question is if his belief was grounded or a result of stress. Underhill’s professional life shows he was rational and factual for most of it. That lends weight to the idea that he encountered something extraordinary to make him act so extraordinarily at the end.

In fiction and popular culture, Underhill hasn’t been directly portrayed often, but one could see parallels. Characters in Oliver Stone’s JFK (1991) composite multiple historical figures; one of them, “X” (played by Donald Sutherland), is a JFK-era insider who spills secrets. “X” was based primarily on Col. Fletcher Prouty (another military intelligence officer who became a conspiracy advocate), but Underhill’s story is sometimes compared to Prouty’s. If a dramatization of Underhill were done, it would be a compelling one-man play: Harvard grad, war hero, part of the club, then spiraling after Dallas, dying alone in fear.

Finally, from a conspiracy theory critique perspective, Underhill’s case serves as a reminder of how unresolved mysteries linger. Decades of analysis haven’t given a definitive answer, which keeps the speculation alive. Each generation re-examines it with new tools (e.g., could modern forensics glean anything from the old autopsy if it were exhumed? Possibly not enough to matter). The consensus among neutral scholars is that there isn’t enough evidence to assert Underhill was murdered – but they also often concede that his assertions about CIA wrongdoing, while unproven in JFK’s case, align with patterns seen in other CIA scandals.

In conclusion, John Garrett Underhill Jr.’s life and death have ensured him a small but enduring place in American historical discourse. His contributions to military intelligence were valuable in their time, even if unsung. And his leap into the Kennedy assassination mystery has made him a figure of intrigue whose story continues to be dissected. In a way, Underhill’s fate encapsulates the tragedy of the JFK assassination itself: a capable man consumed by the enormity of that event, leaving questions that refuse to be fully answered.
